Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyse changes in organic compounds, the substrates, by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate's chains and rings. In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, Cornforth determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate were replaced by an enzyme to effect a given change in the substrate, allowing him to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol.Deaf Scientist Corner - John Warcup Cornforth, Texas Woman's University For this work, he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975, alongside co-recipient Vladimir Prelog, and was knighted in 1977.John Cornforth, Royal Institution of Australia

Carlos Schwabe (July 21, 1866 – 22 January 1926) was a German Symbolist painter and printmaker.  
Schwabe was born in Altona, Holstein, and moved to Geneva, Switzerland at an early age.  After studying art in Geneva, he relocated to Paris as a young man, where he worked as a wallpaper designer, and he became acquainted with Symbolist artists.  His paintings typically featured mythological and allegorical themes; as an essentially literary artist, he was much in demand as a book illustrator.  He illustrated the novel Le rêve (1892) by Émile Zola, Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (1900), Maurice Maeterlinck's Pelléas et Mélisande (1892), and Albert Samain's Jardin de l'infante (1908).  Schwabe lived in France for the rest of his life and died in Avon, Seine-et-Marne in 1926.
Two distinct styles are recognized in his art. Before 1900, Schwabe's paintings were more individual and experimental, indicating the idealism of the Symbolists; conventional, allegorical scenes from nature became more prominent in his later work. Images of women were important, sometimes representing death and suffering, other times creativity and guidance. His first wife was his model for angels and virgins, and "Death" in The Death of the Grave-Digger (1895) resembles her. The death of a close friend in 1894, when Schwabe was 28 years old, engendered his interest in representing death.
Schwabe created a colour lithograph for the 1892 Salon de la Rose + Croix, the first of six exhibitions organized by Joséphin Péladan that demonstrated the Rosicrucian tendencies of French Symbolism. Schwabe's poster depicted in shades of blue an initiation rite—three women ascending toward spiritual salvation—and is an exemplar of Rosicrucian art.

Ficciones is the most popular collection of short stories by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges, often considered the best introduction to his work. Ficciones should not be confused with Labyrinths, although they have much in common. Labyrinths is a separate translation of Borges's material into English, by James E. Irby, that, like the translation into English of Ficciones, appeared in 1962. Together, these two translations led to much of Borges's worldwide fame in the 1960s. Several stories appear in both volumes. "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" appeared originally in History of Eternity (1936).

The Second Battle of Fallujah — code-named Operation ''Al-Fajr (Arabic,الفجر "the dawn") and 'Operation Phantom Fury' — was a joint American, Iraqi, and British offensive in November and December 2004, considered the highest point of conflict in Fallujah during the Iraq War. It was led by the U.S. Marine Corps against the Iraqi insurgency stronghold in the city of Fallujah and was authorized by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government. The U.S. military called it "some of the heaviest urban combat U.S. Marines have been involved in since the Battle of Huế City in Vietnam in 1968."ScanEagle Proves Worth in Fallujah Fight, DefenseLINK NewsRicks, Thomas E. (2007). Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2003–2005''. Penguin. p. 399. ISBN 0-14-303891-5.
This operation was the second major operation in Fallujah. Earlier, in April 2004, coalition forces fought the First Battle of Fallujah in order to capture or kill insurgent elements considered responsible for the deaths of a Blackwater Security team. When coalition forces (mostly U.S. Marines) fought into the center of the city, the Iraqi government requested that the city's control be transferred to an Iraqi-run local security force, which then began stockpiling weapons and building complex defenses across the city through mid-2004.Ricks, Thomas E. (2007). Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2003–2005. Penguin. pp. 343–346. ISBN 0-14-303891-5 The second battle was the bloodiest battle of the entire Iraq War, and is notable for being the first major engagement of the Iraq War fought solely against insurgents rather than the forces of the former Ba'athist Iraqi government, which was deposed in 2003.

[[Buglass]]
CATEGORIES: Surnames

Buglass is a Scottish surname. According to Black’s The Surnames of Scotland, Buglass derives from the old lands of Booklawes near Melrose, Roxburghshire. An earlier form of spelling is Buke-Lawes, i.e. buck or stag and low ground. Other theories include that the name originates from family/clan colour identification, specifically the Gaelic words Buidhe and Glas (yellow and green respectively) or it is of Norman descent.
The first recorded instance of the name is from 1220, when a Robert de Bucles witnessed a confirmation charter in favour of the Abbey of Kelso. In 1423, John Bewclase (described as “a trustworthy man”) witnessed the testament of Alexander Hume of Dunglass. The name is affiliated with the Home or Hume clan (see below). 
Other early recordings of the name, in various spellings, were:
John Bukles, who witnessed an instrument of sasine in Lothian in 1535. Kathrine Bukles is recorded in 1589, whilst Agnes Buckles was noted living in the parish of Livingstone in 1675, and a John Bowglase signed a document in 1684 in Overlaskeoch. 
There are further variants of the name in the sixteenth century in Lothian:
Buccles ( 1539);
Bukeles (1571);
Buikles (1584 and 1603); and  Bugloss (1680)
The Home clan, to which Buglass is affiliated, derives from Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, who lived early in the 13th century. 
Alexander Home was created a Baron in 1473, and the title was raised to an Earldom by James VI in 1605. Eventually, ithe family of Home of Coldingknow succeeded to the title, and from this, the 14th Earl is directly descended. For political reasons, he resigned his earldom to become Sir Alec Douglas-Home, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
Due to the geographical position of Roxburghshire, the Buglass name is also common in northern parts of England, such as Northumberland.

Hangu Pass (Traditional Chinese: 函谷關; pinyin: Hángǔ Guān) was a strategic pass in ancient China just south of the great eastern bend of the Yellow River in today's Lingbao, Henan Province. The Qin built the pass in 361 BC as its eastern gate.
Because of its strategic location between the ancient lands of the State of Qin and the central plains of China, many famous ancient battles were fought at Hangu Pass. During the Warring States period, Hangu Pass was heavily defended by the State of Qin, as the pass was the only reasonable route to invade the State of Qin from the central plains of China. Hangu Pass was also a vital route in invading the ancient capital of Luoyang from the west.
According to legend, Lao Zi supposedly wrote the Dao De Jing at Hangu Pass.

[[Prospective short circuit current]]

CATEGORIES: Electric power

The prospective short circuit current (PSCC) or available fault current or short circuit making current is the highest electric current which can exist in a particular electrical system under short-circuit conditions. It is determined by the voltage and impedance of the supply system. It is of the order of a few thousand amperes for a standard domestic mains electrical installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage or, occasionally, Separated Extra Low Voltage) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems. 
Protective devices such as circuit breakers and fuses must be selected with an interrupting rating that exceeds the prosepective short circuit current, if they are to safely protect the circuit from a fault. When a large electric current is interrupted an arc forms, and if the breaking capacity of a fuse or circuit breaker is exceeded, it will not extinguish the arc. Current will continue, resulting in damage to equipment, fire or explosion.

[[Decorative arts]]
CATEGORIES: Decorative arts, Art genres, Art media, Interior design, Architectural elements, Gardening aids, Design

The decorative arts is traditionally a term for the design and manufacture of functional objects.  It includes interior design, but not usually architecture.  The decorative arts are often categorized in opposition to the "fine arts", namely, painting, drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, which generally have no function other than to be seen.
The distinction between decorative and fine arts has essentially risen from the 
post-Renaissance art of the West, where it is for the most part meaningful.  It is much less so when applied to the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works often include those in "decorative" media, or all works are in such media.  For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, as does the art of many traditional cultures, and in Chinese art the distinction is less useful than in Europe.  Even in Europe, the distinction is unhelpful for Early Medieval art, where although "fine arts" such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, the most prestigious works, commissioned from the best artists, tended to be in goldsmith work, cast metals such as bronze or other techniques such as ivory carving.  Large-scale wall-paintings were apparently much less regarded, relatively crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources; they were probably seen as a cheap but inferior substitute for mosaic, which in this period must be treated as a fine art, though in recent centuries contemporary production has tended to be seen as decorative.  The term "ars sacra" ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art in metal, ivory, textiles and other high-value materials from this period, though this does not cover the even rarer survivals of secular works.  
Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine art media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media.  Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be "recycled" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed.  Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store.
The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Vasari promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance, that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo, Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci, reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity.  Most European art during the Middle Ages had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued.  In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries: ink and wash painting, mostly of landscapes, was to a large extent produced by and for the scholar-bureaucrats or "literati", and was intended as an expression of the artist's imagination above all, while other major fields of art, including the very important Chinese ceramics produced in effectively industrial conditions, were produced according to a completely different set of artistic values.
The lower status given to works of decorative art in contrast to fine art narrowed with the rise of the Arts and Crafts movement. This aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was born in England and inspired by William Morris and John Ruskin. The movement represented the beginning of a greater appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts Movement to a new generation led, in 1882, to the English architect and designer Arthur H. Mackmurdo organizing the Century Guild for craftsmen, which championed the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists’ ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement."Arts and Crafts Movement". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 17 Oct. 2012. . The influence of the Arts and Crafts Movement led to the decorative arts being given a greater appreciation and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law. Until the enactment of the Copyright Act 1911 only works of fine art had been protected from unauthorised copying. The 1911 Act extended the definition of an "artistic work" to include works of "artistic craftsmanship". For the first time works of decorative art could be classfied as works of art rather than design and benefit from the full period of copyright protection previously available only to works of fine art.Section 35(1) Copyright Act 1911 : http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/46/section/35/enacted ; Edmund Eldergill, Barrister-at-Law, "The Decorative Arts and Copyright", legal article, 2012.

''Trans''-splicing is a special form of RNA processing in eukaryotes where exons from two different primary RNA transcripts are joined end to end and ligated.
In contrast "normal" (cis-)splicing processes a single molecule. That is, trans-splicing results in an RNA transcript that came from multiple RNA polymerases on the genome. This phenomenon can be exploited for molecular therapy to address mutated gene products.[tpl]cite journal| pmid=19409879| year=2009| last1=Iwasaki| first1=R| last2=Kiuchi| first2=H| last3=Ihara| first3=M| last4=Mori| first4=T| last5=Kawakami| first5=M| last6=Ueda| first6=H| title=Trans-splicing as a novel method to rapidly produce antibody fusion proteins| volume=384| issue=3| pages=316–21| doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.04.122| journal=Biochemical and biophysical research communications[/tpl]

An electoral swing analysis (or swing) shows the extent of change in voter support, typically from one election to another, expressed as a positive or negative percentage. A multi-party swing is an indicator of a change in the electorate's preference between candidates or parties (e.g. Conservative to Social Democrat). A swing can be calculated for the electorate as a whole, for a given electoral district or for a particular demographic.
A swing is particularly useful for analysing change in voter support over time, or as a tool for predicting the outcome of elections in constituency-based systems.  Swing is also usefully deployed when analysing the shift in voter intentions revealed by (political) opinion polls or to compare polls concisely which may rely differing samples and on markedly different swings and therefore predict extraneous results.Electoral Calculus 2010 Election: UK Polls Comparison

[[SR protein]]
CATEGORIES: Proteins, Molecular biology, Biochemistry

SR proteins are a conserved family of proteins involved in RNA splicing. SR proteins are named because they contain a protein domain with long repeats of serine and arginine amino acid residues, whose standard abbreviations are "S" and "R" respectively.  SR proteins are 50-300 protein residues in length and composed of two domains, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) region and the RS binding domain. SR proteins are more commonly found in the nucleus than the cytoplasm, but several SR proteins are known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
SR proteins were discovered in the 1990s in Drosophila and in amphibian oocytes, and later in humans. In general, metazoans appear to have SR proteins and unicellular organisms lack SR proteins.
SR proteins are important in constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, genome stabilization, nonsense-mediated decay, and translation. SR proteins alternatively splice pre-mRNA by preferentially selecting different splice sites on the pre-mRNA strands to create multiple mRNA transcripts from one pre-mRNA transcript. Once splicing is complete the SR protein may or may not remain attached to help shuttle the mRNA strand out of the nucleus. As RNA Polymerase II is transcribing DNA into RNA, SR proteins attach to newly made pre-mRNA to prevent the pre-mRNA from binding to the coding DNA strand to increase genome stabilization. Topoisomerase I and SR proteins also interact to increase genome stabilization. SR proteins can control the concentrations of specific mRNA that is successfully translated into protein by selecting for nonsense-mediated decay codons during alternative splicing. SR proteins can alternatively splice NMD codons into its own mRNA transcript to auto-regulate the concentration of SR proteins. Through the mTOR pathway and interactions with polyribosomes, SR proteins can increase translation of mRNA.
Ataxia telangiectasia, neurofibromatosis type 1, several cancers, HIV-1, and spinal muscular atrophy have all been linked to alternative splicing by SR proteins.

Asüna was a captive import automobile marque created in 1993 for the Canadian market by General Motors as a counterpart to Geo. It was one of two successors to the Passport marque, which had a similar intent.
Preceding the Asüna marque, Passport sold a Korean (Daewoo) made badge engineered Opel Kadett E known as the Passport Optima (which hit Canadian shores in 1991) as well as a selection of Isuzu cars and SUVs. General Motors Canada changed its branding strategy in 1988, disbanding Passport (the Optima was rebadged as Pontiac LeMans). Isuzu was grouped together with Saab and GM's new, import-fighting Saturn division to form Saturn-Saab-Isuzu dealerships. The Geo marque was introduced in Canada in (model year) 1992, offered at Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac dealers (who had been selling the Geo marque's products as Chevrolets from 1988 until the marque's introduction). Sales of Geo vehicles were relatively successful, prompting Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealers to request GM Canada to provide a lineup of similar "import" vehicles. Asüna was created to fulfill this demand.
The Pontiac LeMans model name was dropped altogether in favour of trimline designations, selling as Asüna SE in base trim hatchbacks and sedans, and as Asüna GT as a higher trim hatchback. The Asüna lineup was rounded out by the Sunfire and Sunrunner taking the GMC Tracker's place in the Pontiac-Buick-GMC lineup.
Asüna sales could not match Geo's, and the Asüna marque was eliminated in 1994. The SE/GT and Sunfire were dropped from the GM Canada lineup and Sunrunner was rebadged as a Pontiac.

He began euphonium lessons at 12, and at 16 entered Colchester College to study music. On graduating, and after a period of busking in London (where he briefly shared a house with artists Mark Wallinger and Andy Dog), he returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for the mentally handicapped.
His first recording experience was in 1983 with his brother Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois for the album Apollo at Lanois’ Grant Avenue Studios in Canada. His first solo album, Voices, was released in 1985.  
Although mainly regarded as a pianist, Roger Eno is in fact a multi-instrumentalist and keen singer, as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including Bill Nelson, No-Man, Lol Hammond, Mads Arp, Peter Hammill, Tim Bowness, and Michael Brook, the most successful of which was probably his co-written album, The Familiar, with Kate St John.
Eno performs live on occasion and continues to write soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films, including For All Mankind, Nine and a Half Weeks, Warm Summer Rain and The Jacket, while tracks have been used in advertisements, including for Nissan and for Japan Railways.
Eno has recently recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the UK-based internet label Burning Shed. In 2007, he contributed to the Mid/Air LP by Dive Index, a collaborative music project of composer/producer Will Thomas.
In 2013 Eno released a new album, Endless City / Concrete Garden , under the name Roger Eno / Plumbline.http://www.rogereno.com/new-for-2013.php

A full-rigged ship or fully rigged ship is a sailing vessel with three or more masts, all of them square-rigged. A full-rigged ship is said to have a ship rig or be ship-rigged.
Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a ship in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage, to distinguish it from other vessels such as schooners, barques, barquentines, brigs, etc. Alternatively, a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead, as in collier or frigate, rather than being called a ship. In many languages the word frigate or frigate rig refers to a full-rigged ship.

Franta Belsky (1921–2000) was a Czech sculptor.
He was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1921, the son of the economist Josef Bělský. With his family, he fled to England after the German invasion, and volunteered for the Czech Exile Army. He fought in France as a gunner and was twice mentioned in dispatches.
He returned to Prague after the war to find that many of his relations had perished in the Holocaust. He designed a paratroop memorial, and a medal in honour of Emil Zátopek, before fleeing again to escape the Communist takeover in 1948. 
His work includes not only traditional statues and busts, but also large-scale more abstract works. He produced a number of statues of Winston Churchill, one of them at the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library in Fulton, Missouri. His royal busts are in the British National Portrait Gallery, his Admiral Cunningham in Trafalgar Square and Mountbatten in Horse Guards, in London.  Belsky also designed the Torsion Fountain at the Shell Centre in London.  
Among other honors Belsky won the Otto Beit Medal of the Royal British Society of Sculptors for excellence in sculpture.  
In 1944 he married Margaret Owen the newspaper cartoonist, who signed her own work Belsky.  After her death in 1989, in 1996 he remarried fellow sculptor Irena Sedlecka.  He sculpted two busts of U.S. President Harry S. Truman before dying on 5 July 2000.

[[Crystal field theory]]

CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Inorganic chemistry, Chemical bonding, Coordination chemistry, Transition metals

Crystal field theory (CFT) is a model that describes the breaking of degeneracies of electron orbital states, usually d or f orbitals, due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding charge distribution (anion neighbors).  This theory has been used to describe various spectroscopies of transition metal coordination complexes, in particular optical spectra (colors).  CFT successfully accounts for some magnetic properties, colours, hydration enthalpies, and spinel structures of transition metal complexes, but it does not attempt to describe bonding.  CFT was developed by physicists Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck van Vleck[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Van Vleck | first1 = J. | title = Theory of the Variations in Paramagnetic Anisotropy Among Different Salts of the Iron Group | journal = Physical Review | volume = 41 | pages = 208 | year = 1932 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.41.208|bibcode = 1932PhRv...41..208V [/tpl] in the 1930s.  CFT was subsequently combined with molecular orbital theory to form the more realistic and complex ligand field theory (LFT), which delivers insight into the process of chemical bonding in transition metal complexes.

[[Electricity meter]]
CATEGORIES: Electric power, Electric power distribution, Measuring instruments, Energy measurement

An electricity meter or energy meter is a device that measures the amount of electric energy consumed by a residence, business, or an electrically powered device.
Electricity meters are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the kilowatt hour kWh. Periodic readings of electricity meters establishes billing cycles and energy used during a cycle.
In settings when energy savings during certain periods are desired, meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. "Time of day" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for demand response load shedding during peak load periods.E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System, accessed 22 August 2009.

Wapping Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock to the north, Queens Dock to the south. Kings Dock was originally located to the west, but has since been filled in.
The dock was opened in 1852. It was named after the road it runs alongside and which also gave its name to the Wapping Tunnel.
The large brick warehouse built in 1856 along the eastern side of the dock was designed by Jesse Hartley. The building is of a similar architectural style to the warehouses surrounding the nearby Albert Dock. When originally built, it was 232 metres long and consisting of five separate sections. Bombed in the May Blitz of 1941, the badly damaged southernmost section was not rebuilt, with only the supporting cast iron columns remaining in situ.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.run.liverpool.gov.uk/albertdock.asp |title=Albert Dock Conservation Area|publisher=Liverpool World Heritage|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl] The remainder of the building continued in commercial use, even after the dock closed in 1972.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/dock_history11.html |title=Trading Places: Wapping Dock|publisher=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl] The warehouse was restored and converted into residential apartments in 1988 and is Grade II* listed.

The chlamys (Ancient Greek: χλαμύς, gen.: χλαμύδος; also known as the ephaptis ἐφαπτίς)[tpl]citation required|date=October 2013[/tpl] was an ancient Greek piece of clothing, a type of cloak.Ancient Greek Dress Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000-2013. Retrieved 7 October 2013.
The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of woolen material about the size of a blanket, usually bordered. It was normally pinned with a fibula at the right shoulder.  Originally it was wrapped around the waist like a loincloth, but by the end of the 5th century BC it was worn over the elbows. It could be worn over another item of clothing, but was often the sole item of clothing for young soldiers and messengers, at least in Greek art. As such, the chlamys is the characteristic garment of Hermes (Roman Mercury), the messenger god usually depicted as a young man.
The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BCE. As worn by soldiers, it could be wrapped around the arm and used as a light shield in combat.
The chlamys continued into the Byzantine period, when it was often much larger and worn sideways. It was held on with a clasp at the shoulder, and nearly reached the ground at front and back.

The Huaorani, Waorani or Waodani, also known as the Waos, are native Amerindians from the Amazonian Region of Ecuador (Napo, Orellana and Pastaza Provinces) who have marked differences from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. The alternate name Auca is a pejorative exonym used by the neighboring Quechua Indians, and commonly adopted by Spanish-speakers as well. Auca – awqa in Quechua – means "savage".
They comprise almost 4,000 inhabitants and speak the Huaorani language, a linguistic isolate that is not known to be related to any other language.
Their ancestral lands are located between the Curaray and Napo rivers, about 50 miles (80 km) south of El Coca. These homelands – approximately 120 miles (190 km) wide and 75 to 100 miles (120 to 160 km) from north to south – are threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices.  In the past, Huaorani were able to protect their culture and lands from both indigenous enemies and settlers.
In the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to live mostly in permanent forest settlements.  As many as five communities – the Tagaeri, the Huiñatare, the Oñamenane, and two groups of the Taromenane – have rejected all contact with the outside world and continue to move into more isolated areas.

[[Belgian nationalism]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of Belgium, Belgian nationalism, Belgian society, Federalism, Nationalism by country or region

Belgian nationalism (or Belgicistic nationalism; [tpl]Lang-nl|Belgicisme[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-fr|Belgicanisme[/tpl]) defines an ideology that favours a strong centralized government, with less or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and dissolve the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium. 
It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the Belgian state level by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s - contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions. Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship. 
Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians, alongside some socialists, certain circles in Brussels, some sections of the far right and historically among fascists. Though the majority of Flemings do not (yet) favor independence of their region, and as the Walloons, Brussels and the German-speakers are strongly regionalist, there is no popular support in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in recent years, so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.

Dr. Francis Lister Hawks (10 June 1798 – 26 September 1866) was an American priest of the Episcopal Church, and a politician in North Carolina.
After practicing law with some distinction he entered the Episcopalian ministry in 1827 and proved a brilliant and impressive preacher, holding livings in New Haven, Philadelphia, New York City and New Orleans, and declining several bishoprics. Scandals in the 1830s and 40s led him to posts on the American frontier, although he eventually returned to New York City.
Hawks's work on church history remains important today. On his appointment as historiographer of his church in 1835, he went to England and collected the abundant materials afterwards utilized in his Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of U.S.A. (New York, 1836–1839). These two volumes dealt with Maryland and Virginia, while two later ones (1863 1864) were devoted to Connecticut.
Hawks edited the single volume Appletons' Cyclopaedia of Biography (1856), which added American biographies to the volume edited by Elihu Rich and published in 1854 by Richard Griffin & Company (London).

[[South Ferry Basin]]

CATEGORIES: Liverpool docks

The South Ferry Basin is a dock on the River Mersey, England and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated near the southern dock system, it is only connected directly to the river.
From 4 April 1865 a ferry service was established between the South Ferry Basin and New Ferry on the Wirral Peninsula, with additional sailings to Liverpool Pier Head. Facilities at the basin consisted of a pontoon moored against the dock wall. The "South End" service appeared to be relatively short-lived, as by 1876, these facilities had been removed and sold for scrap.[tpl]citebook|title=Mersey Ferries - Volume 1 |first=TB|last=Maund|publisher=Transport Publishing Co. Ltd|page=60|date=1991|isbn=0-86317-166-4[/tpl]
This small dock was also known locally as the 'Cocklehole' and was a place that Liverpool ceded to the poor cocklefishers and oystercatchers for the mooring and repair of their boats whilst the main port of Liverpool handled the large trade. It was little known under its own name and often confused as being part of Coburg Dock. The dock is open to the river and is currently heavily silted up. It isn't used for anything.
Although the basin remains unaltered, the surrounding area has since been redeveloped for residential purposes.

The region was abolished with a reorganisation of regions in 2006.City of Johannesburg.The seven regions. Accessed 20 February 2008.
The area is fairly heavily populated with the large urban centre of Sandton located in the region, however there are also many parks with large biodiversity.  This area is close to Johannesburg's central business district. It is infamous for its heavy traffic, however in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development the government spent considerable sums of money investing in upgrades to the transportation network.

The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was an accord signed in Colombo on 29 July, 1987, between Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene.

Importantly however, the Tamil groups, notably the The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (which at the time was one of the strongest Tamil forces) had not been made party to the talks and initially agreed to surrender their arms to the Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF) only reluctantly. Within a few months however, this flared into an active confrontation. The LTTE declared their intent to continue the armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam and refused to disarm. The IPKF found itself engaged in a bloody police action against the LTTE. Further complicating the return to peace was a burgeoning Sinhalese insurgency in the south.

On plates issued before 1 January 2007 the flag of Romania was used instead of the 12 European stars. The digits and letters are usually assigned at random, unless a customization fee is paid. The plates are issued for each car and for each owner, and they must be returned when the car is either sold or scrapped, although the new buyer is entitled to request continued use of the old number plate. Letter combinations that may form obscene text in Romanian are not issued. The letter "Q" is not used as it may be confused with "O". Also the three-letter code cannot start with "I" or "O", as they can be mistaken with "1" or "0" (until 1999, "I" and "O" were not used at all).

The Global Certification Forum, known as GCF, is an active partnership between mobile network operators, mobile device manufacturers and the test industry. GCF was founded in 1999, and its membership has been responsible for creating an independent certification programme to help ensure global interoperability between mobile devices and networks.
The GCF certification process is based on technical requirements as specified within dedicated test specifications provided by the 3GPP, OMA, IMTC, the GSM Association and others.
The current GCF membership includes mobile network operators, more than 40 leading terminal manufacturers and over 65 test equipment manufacturers, test laboratories and other organizations from mainly a test environment.
GCF's guiding maxim is "test once, use anywhere."
Recognised Test Organisations (RTOs) http://www.globalcertificationforum.org/certification/rto.html are GCF Members that have demonstrated they possess the experience, qualifications and systems to assess mobile phones and wireless devices against GCF's Certification Criteria.
From January 1, 2013, it became a requirement that all device testing associated with GCF Certification must be undertaken by an RTO. The scheme recognises Test Organisations in three distinct disciplines: Conformance Testing, Field Trials and Interoperability Testing. To become an RTO, an organisation must submit a declaration confirming that it understands GCF procedures and has the ability to conduct testing in accordance with GCF rules and the relevant RTO requirements.

Johann Michael Vogl (August 10, 1768 – November 19,Michael Lorenz: Studien zum Schubertkreis, Phil. Diss. Vienna, 2001 1840), was an Austrian baritone singer and composer. Though famous in his day, he is remembered mainly for his close professional relationship and friendship with composer Franz Schubert.
Vogl was born in Steyr. As a young man he enrolled at the Gymnasium at Kremsmünster, where he studied languages, philosophy, and sang in several musical productions by his friend Franz Süßmayr (the same man who completed Mozart's Requiem). In 1786 Vogl went to Vienna to study, and later to practice law. In 1795 he debuted at the Vienna Hofoper, and quickly attracted a following for both his acting capability and the beauty of his voice.
In 1813, Franz Schubert attended a performance of Gluck's Iphigénie en Tauride in which Vogl sang the role of Orestes; Schubert never forgot the experience and determined to write for Vogl. The following year, when Vogl sang the role of Pizarro at the premiere of the final version of Beethoven's Fidelio, it is said that the 17-year-old Schubert actually sold his schoolbooks in order to afford a ticket.
When composer and singer finally met, in 1817, Vogl was as impressed with the quality of Schubert's music as Schubert was with Vogl's singing. Schubert wrote many of his subsequent songs with Vogl in mind. One of their early successes was an 1821 performance of Der Erlkönig, prior to its publication and to significant popular acclaim.
Rarely in music history has the relationship of a composer and a specific singer been so musically productive. Vogl continued to sing Schubert's music after the death of his friend in 1828, famously singing a complete performance of Winterreise accompanied by the pianist Emanuel Mikschik shortly before his own death on the twelfth anniversary of the death of his friend. He died in Vienna.

Between 1899 and 1923 the SE&CR had a monopoly of railway service in Kent, and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium.
The companies had competed extensively, with some of the bitterest conflicts between British railway companies.  Competing routes to the same destination were built, so many towns in Kent were served by both companies, with a legacy of two stations and services to multiple London termini.

The CA engine is a 1.6 L to 2.0 L Inline-4 piston engine from Nissan designed for a variety of smaller Nissan vehicles to replace the Z engine and some smaller, four-cylinder L series engines. It is an iron block, aluminum head design with a timing belt, thus was cheaper to make than the timing chain setup on the Z and L engines.  Earlier versions featured SOHC and eight valves. The new CA block design was a scaled up E series block with timing shaft and other ancillaries removed. The oil pump is fitted directly onto the crank nose and the distributor is driven by the end of the camshaft. Like the E series and the A block from which the E was derived, Nissan used a taller block for the largest stroked 2.0 litre engine. The CA was designed to be compact and light, with a CA16 requiring only 195 litres of space (compared to 280 litres for the earlier Z16), while weighing 23% less at [tpl]convert|115|kg|lb|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | journal = World Cars 1982 | title = Japan: Shogun Strikes Back | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 64 | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-910714-14-2 [/tpl] The engine was called the "CA" series for Clean Air, due to the installation of Nissan emission reducing technology, called NAPS-X.
Later versions featured DOHC with 16 valves for increased efficiency at high engine speeds and a smoother power delivery. The hydraulic lifters are interchangeable between all DOHC RB and VG series engines excepting those with solid lifters.
The motor was expensive to produce being cast iron, Production ceased in 1991. The 1.8 L and 2.0 L versions were replaced by the SR series as the primary Nissan four-cylinder engine, while the smaller 1.6 L was replaced by the GA.

True Stories is a 1986 American film that spans the genres of musical, art, and comedy, directed by and starring David Byrne of the band Talking Heads. It co-stars John Goodman, Swoosie Kurtz, and Spalding Gray. Byrne has described the film as, "A project with songs based on true stories from tabloid newspapers. It's like 60 Minutes on acid."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE-mxVxFXLg&feature=related |title=David Byrne Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2013-10-12[/tpl]
True Stories was released by Warner Bros. in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Sweden in 1986, with limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture's direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads' 1984 concert film, Stop Making Sense.
The majority of the film's music is supplied by Talking Heads. A soundtrack album, titled Sounds From True Stories, featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, and Terry Allen & The Panhandle Mystery Band, among others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album, titled True Stories, which included the band's versions of songs featured in the film.

Hod Hill (or Hodd Hill) is a large hill fort in the Blackmore Vale, [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] north-west of Blandford Forum, Dorset, England. The fort sits on a [tpl]convert|143|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] chalk hill of the same name that lies between the adjacent Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase. The hill fort at Hambledon Hill is just to the north.
The fort is roughly rectangular ([tpl]convert|600|by|400|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]), with an enclosed area of [tpl]convert|22|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=127830|title='Sectional Preface', An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Dorset, Volume 3: Central (1970), pp. XXXV-LXII.|accessdate=7 March 2014|publisher=University of London & History of Parliament Trust|work=British History Online|date=[/tpl] There is a steep natural slope down to the River Stour to the west, the other sides have an artificial rampart, ditch and counterscarp (outer bank), with an additional rampart on the north side. The main entrance is at the south-east corner, with other openings at the south-west and north-east corners.
The hillfort was inhabited by the Durotriges in the late Iron Age; whether this is the same tribe who fortified the hilltop in the middle Iron Age (radiocarbon analysis suggests a date of 500 BC for the main rampart) is unknown. There is extensive evidence of settlement within the fort, including platforms for roundhouses.
Hod Hill is the second in a series of Iron Age earthworks, ‘Hill Forts of the Stour Valley’ by David E. C. Jardine, 1985, Bournemouth Local Studies Publications starting from Hambledon Hill, and including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites.
The hill was captured in AD 43 by the Roman Second Legion (Augusta), led by Vespasian, who had already captured Maiden Castle and other hill forts to the south. Eleven iron ballista bolts have been found on the hill, clustered in the so-called "Chieftain's hut" area (two hut circles, one of which had an enclosure around it)Miles 1978: 69 but there are no other signs of a struggle, suggesting the Durotriges surrendered to the superior Roman army.
The Romans built a camp ([tpl]convert|200|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl]) in the north-west corner of the original fort, occupied by a mixed force of 720 legionaries and auxiliaries. The fort was used as a base for about 5 or 6 years, but passed out of use by about AD 50, when troops were withdrawn for the campaigns against Caractacus in Wales, and the remaining men were moved to a new fort further west at Waddon Hill.
The site was excavated in the 1950s by Sir Ian RichmondMiles 1978: 67 and his final report was published in 1969. Today the hill is an important calcareous grassland habitat, home to spectacular wild flowers and butterflies.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wra-1356322822892/view-page/item604083/ | title = Hod Hill perambulation | work = National Trust website [/tpl]

[[Football hooliganism]]
CATEGORIES: Association football hooliganism, Violence

Football hooliganism refers to unruly, violent, and destructive behaviour by overzealous supporters of football clubs, including brawling, vandalism and intimidation.[tpl]Cite news|title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease |work=The Independent|date=2004-06-17|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London[/tpl]
Football hooliganism normally involves conflict between gangs, often known as football firms (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the specific purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams.  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs (usually, but not always, geographically close) and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies), is likely to be more severe.
Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadia to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.  In such cases, shop windows may be smashed, rubbish bins set on fire, and police cars may be overturned. In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured riot police have intervened with tear gas, police dogs, armoured vehicles and water cannons.

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Cepheus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon, within one crater diameter of the larger crater Franklin to the southeast. To the north-north-east is the flooded crater Oersted. The proximity of this formation to the lunar limb means it appears oblong when viewed from the Earth due to foreshortening.
This is a relatively young formation, and the rim is still sharp and well-defined. The exception is an even younger, bowl-shaped crater that lies across the northeast rim. This is a satellite crater designated Cepheus A. The remaining rim is nearly circular, with outward bulges to the north and south. The inner wall is terraced in places, most notably along the northwest wall. There is a central peak formation at the midpoint of the floor which stretches somewhat to the north and south.

[[Alba Fucens]]

CATEGORIES: Roman sites of Abruzzo, Former populated places in Italy, Archaeological sites in Abruzzo

Alba Fucens was an ancient Italic town occupying a lofty location (1,000 m) at the foot of the Monte Velino, c. 6.5 km north of Avezzano, Abruzzo, central Italy. Its remains are today in the comune of Massa d'Albe. 
It was originally a town of the Aequi, though on the frontier of the Marsi, but was occupied by a Roman colony (304 BC) owing to its strategic importance. It lay on a hill just to the north of the Via Valeria, which was probably prolonged beyond Tibur at this very period. In the Second Punic War Alba at first remained faithful, but afterwards refused to send contingents and was punished.
After this it became a regular place of detention for important state prisoners, such as Syphax of Numidia, Perseus of Macedonia, Bituitus, king of the Arverni. It was attacked by the allies in the Social War, but remained faithful to Rome; and its strong position rendered it a place of some importance in the civil wars. Its prosperity, in the imperial period, can only be inferred from the number of inscriptions found there.
It is chiefly remarkable for its finely preserved fortifications. The external walls, which have a circuit of about 3 km, are constructed of polygonal masonry; the blocks are carefully jointed, and the faces smoothed. With our present knowledge of such constructions their date cannot certainly be determined. They are not preserved to any very considerable height; but the arrangement of the gates is clearly traceable; as a rule they come at the end of a long, straight stretch of wall, and are placed so as to leave the right side of any attacking force exposed. On the north there is, for a length of about 150 m, a triple line of defences of later date (possibly added by the Roman colonists), inasmuch as both the city wall proper, and the double wall thrown out in front of it are partly constructed of concrete, and faced with finer polygonal masonry (in which horizontal joints seem to be purposely avoided).
A mile to the north of the city a huge mound with a ditch on each side of it (but at a considerable distance from it) may be traced; for a couple of miles. Within the walls there are hardly any buildings of a later date. Excavations have only been made casually, though remains of buildings and of roads can be traced, and also an extensive system of underground passages perhaps connected with the defences of the place. The hill at the western extremity was occupied by a temple of the Tuscan order, into which was built the church of S. Pietro; this contains ancient columns, and some remarkably fine specimens of Cosmatesque work. It is the only monastic church in the Abruzzi in which the nave is separated from the aisles by ancient columns.
The collegiate church of S. Nicola, in the village, contains a remarkable staurotheca of the 11th (?) century, and a wooden triptych in imitation of the Byzantine style with enamels, of the 13th century.

[[Fabry (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Fabry is a large lunar crater of the form termed a walled plain. It is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northeastern limb. Parts of this area are sometimes brought into view by the effects of libration, but the terrain is seen from the edge and so not much in the way of detail can be observed.
This formation is of significant dimensions in its own right, but it overlies the northeast rim of an even larger basin named Harkhebi. To the west is the crater Vashakidze, and east of Fabry is the small Petrie. Northwards lies Swann.
The outer rim of Fabry is heavily worn and eroded, with notches from subsequent impacts. A pair of small craters, including Fabry H, lies along the eastern rim. Smaller craters lie along many parts of this remaining rim, most notably a small crater across the southern rim, and a short, hook-shaped valley cutting across the northwest rim. Only a few sections of the rim remain relatively intact, while the remainder is merely a ring of mountainous terrain.
Sections of the interior floor are relatively smooth and level, but the surface is rough and irregular in the northeast quadrant. There is a central peak formed from a long massif that covers nearly a quarter of the crater diameter from west to east. At the southeast end of this formation is a small crater, located just to the southeast of the midpoint. The remainder of the floor has been resurfaced, and now is marked only by tiny craterlets and the rough ground along the edge of the rim.
Ray material from the young crater Giordano Bruno to the south carries across the floor of Harkhebi, and lies in a few faint patches on the floor of Fabry. This is most notable in the southern part of the crater to the south of the small crater near the midpoint.

[[Maury (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Maury is a small lunar impact crater named for two cousins. It was first named in honor of Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury of the U. S. Naval Observatory and later  shared to honor Antonia Maury of Harvard College Observatory. The crater lies in the northeastern part of the Moon, just to the east of the Lacus Somniorum. The nearest named craters are Hall to the southwest, and Cepheus farther to the northeast. Just to the west of Maury is the lava-flooded remains of the satellite crater Maury C.
This is a young bowl-shaped crater with a circular rim and a tiny flat floor at the midpoint. The surface of the floor has a cluster of small hills. The inner walls appear lighter than the surrounding terrain due to higher albedo. This is normal for recently formed craters, and the interior will gradually grow darker due to space weathering.

[[Differential of the first kind]]
CATEGORIES: Complex manifolds, Algebraic geometry

In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms. Given a complex manifold M, a differential of the first kind ω is therefore the same thing as a 1-form that is everywhere holomorphic; on an algebraic variety V that is non-singular it would be a global section of the coherent sheaf Ω1 of Kähler differentials. In either case the definition has its origins in the theory of abelian integrals.
The dimension of the space of  differentials of the first kind, by means of this identification, is the Hodge number
The differentials of the first kind, when integrated along paths, give rise to integrals that generalise the elliptic integrals to all curves over the complex numbers. They include for example the hyperelliptic integrals of type
where Q is a square-free polynomial of any given degree > 4. The allowable power k has to be determined by analysis of the possible pole at the point at infinity on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve. When this is done, one finds that the condition is 
or in other words, k at most 1 for degree of Q 5 or 6, at most 2 for degree 7 or 8, and so on.
Quite generally, as this example illustrates, for a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve, the Hodge number is the genus g. For the case of algebraic surfaces, this is the quantity known classically as the irregularity q. It is also, in general, the dimension of the Albanese variety, which takes the place of the Jacobian variety.

[[Mons Massicus]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Italy

For the genus of beetles see Massicus (genus)
Mons Massicus, a mountain ridge of ancient Italy, in the territory of the Aurunci, and on the border of Campania and Latium adjectum attributed by most authors to the latter.
It projects south-west from the volcanic system of Rocca Monfina (see Suessa Aurunca) as far as the sea, and separates the lower course of the Liris from the plain of Campania. It consists of limestone, with a superstratum of pliocenic and volcanic masses, and was once an island; its highest point is 811 meters (2661 feet) above sea-level.
It was very famous for its wine in ancient times. There was just room along the coast for the road to pass through; the pass was guarded by the Auruncan town of Vescia (probably on the mountain side), which ceased to exist in 314 BC after the defeat of the Ausones, but left its name to the spot. Its successor, Sinuessa, on the coast, a station on the Via Appia, was constructed in 312 BC, and a colony was founded there in 295 BC.
It is not infrequently mentioned by classical writers as a place in which travellers halted. Here Virgil joined Horace on the famous journey to Brundisium. Domitian considerably increased its importance by the construction of the Via Domitiana, which left the Via Appia here and ran to Cumae and Puteoli, and it was he, no doubt, who raised it to the position of colonia Flavia. The town was destroyed by the Saracens, but some ruins of it are still visible two miles north-west of the modern village of Mondragone - the mineral springs which still rise here were frequented in antiquity.

[[Point group]]

CATEGORIES: Crystallography, Euclidean symmetries, Group theory

In geometry, a point group is a group of geometric symmetries (isometries) that keep at least one point fixed. Point groups can exist in a Euclidean space with any dimension, and every point group in dimension d is a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(d). Point groups can be realized as sets of orthogonal matrices M that transform point x into point y:
where the origin is the fixed point. Point-group elements can either be rotations (determinant of M = 1) or else reflections, or improper rotations (determinant of M = −1).
Discrete point groups in more than one dimension come in infinite families, but from the crystallographic restriction theorem and one of Bieberbach's theorems, each number of dimensions has only a finite number of point groups that are symmetric over some lattice or grid with that number. These are the crystallographic point groups.

Mount Hopkins is a mountain in Santa Cruz County, Arizona part of the Santa Rita Mountains range. Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory is located on it. It is within the Coronado National Forest and was named after Gilbert Hopkins who was killed nearby in 1865 during the Battle of Fort Buchanan.
The prime mover was Fred Whipple a professor at Harvard University who was in charge of the small 25 in mirror telescope in Cambridge Massachusetts. In Cambridge the ambient light was so great, that is "polluting" the incoming starlight. the lead engineer appointed by Whipple was Tom Hoffman to search for a Site in the U.S. that would provide a clear view of the sky, high elevation, minimal surroundings of light pollution. After searching many locations, southern Arizona with its dry air and high elevations and with the assistance of The University of Arizona Hoffman focused upon Mt Hopkins. Whipple agreed and the challenge became how to build and transport an 8 meter diameter glass mirror and telescope up an [tpl]convert|8583|ft|0|adj=on[/tpl] mountain that had no road.

Born to a family of peasants, he studied philosophy and theology in Blaj. Starting in 1838, Mureșianu was a professor at Brașov. He published his first poetry in the magazine Foaia pentru Minte, Inimă și Literatură.
He was one of the figures of the 1848 revolution in Transylvania, taking part in the Brașov delegation to the Blaj Assembly in May 1848. His poem Deșteaptă-te, române!, sang to a popular tune chosen by him and Gheorghe Ucenescu, became the hymn of the revolutionaries. Nicolae Bălcescu named it "La Marseillaise of Romanians" for its ability to mobilize the people to fight. The poem became the national anthem of Romania in 1989.
After the revolution, Mureșianu worked as a translator in Sibiu, had some patriotical works published in the Telegraful Român magazine. In 1862 his poetry was gathered in a single volume.

[[Trust company]]

CATEGORIES: Financial services, Offshore finance

A trust company is a corporation, especially a commercial bank, organized to perform the fiduciary  of trusts and agencies. It is normally owned by one of three types of structures: an independent partnership, a bank, or a law firm, each of which specializes in being a trustee of various kinds of trusts and in managing estates. Trust companies are not required to exercise all of the powers that they are granted.  Further, the fact that a trust company in one jurisdiction does not perform all of the duties of a trust company in another jurisdiction is irrelevant and does not have any bearing on whether either company is truly a "trust company".  Therefore, it is safe to say that the term "trust company" must not be narrowly construed.
The "trust" name refers to the ability of the institution's trust department to act as a trustee – someone who administers financial assets on behalf of another. The assets are typically held in the form of a trust, a legal instrument that spells out who the beneficiaries are and what the money can be spent for.
A trustee will manage investments, keep records, manage assets, prepare court accountings, pay bills (depending on the nature of the trust) medical expenses, charitable gifts, inheritances or other distributions of income and principal.

DOI has a stereocenter and R-(-)-DOI is the more active stereoisomer. In neuroscience research, 125I-R-(-)-DOI is used as a radioligand and indicator of the presence of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. DOI's effects have been compared to LSD, although there are differences that experienced users can distinguish.  Besides the longer duration, the trip tends to be more energetic than an LSD trip, with more body load and a different subjective visual experience.

The Veil is an American horror/suspense anthology television series produced in 1958 by Hal Roach Studios.
The series was hosted by Boris Karloff, who also acted in every episode but one, and was allegedly based upon real-life reports of supernatural happenings and the unexplained. Ten of the twelve episodes began and ended with Karloff standing in front of a roaring fireplace and inviting viewers to find out what lies "behind the veil."
Hailed by critics as "the greatest television series never seen" (according to DVD release publicity) The Veil was never broadcast. Troubles within the studio (and the collapse of a preliminary co-production arrangement with National Telefilm Associates) resulted in production being cancelled after only 10 episodes (an additional episode called "Jack the Ripper" had been produced by another studio and was acquired by the Roach Studios; Boris Karloff only introduces the episode). This was considered too few to justify sales to a network or to syndication. In the late 1960s, footage from several episodes was combined to make films that aired on late night television. Ten episodes were released to the public in their entirety for the first time in the 1990s and have subsequently been released on DVD by Something Weird Video. In 1999, "Lifting the Veil of Mystery," a Tom Weaver article on the making of the series (complete with episode guide), appeared in issue #29 of "Cult Movies" magazine.
For many years it was thought that only 10 episodes of The Veil were filmed, and two extra titles ("The Vestris" and "Peggy") were "alternative titles".  However, in 2008 Timeless Media Group released a 2-DVD set of 12 episodes of The Veil under the title Tales of the Unexplained that included those two.  "The Vestris" was an episode of anthology series Telephone Time in 1958, that served as an unofficial pilot for the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.timelessvideo.com/dvds/talesunexplained.html |title=Timeless Media Tales of the Unexplained webpage[/tpl]  It starred Torin Thatcher, Rita Lynn, and guest star Boris Karloff.

He works in fine arts media—such as painting and sculpture—as well as what is conventionally considered commercial media —fashion, merchandise, and animation— and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. He coined the term superflat, which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of post-war Japanese culture and society. Superflat is also used as a moniker to describe Murakami’s own artistic style and that of other Japanese artists he has influenced.[tpl]Citation|last=Hebdige| first=Dick | chapter=Flat Boy vs. Skinny: Takashi Murakami and the Battle for "Japan"| year=2007 | editor-last=Schimmel | editor-first=Paul | title=©Murakami |publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles/Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|publication-date=2007[/tpl]

SMS ''Szent István'' [tpl]efn|name=SMS[/tpl] was a [tpl]sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|0[/tpl] dreadnought of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the only one built in the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary. The Ganz & Company's Danubius Yard in Hungarian-owned Fiume (current-day Rijeka) was awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets. She was named after Hungary's first Christian king, Saint Stephen ([tpl]lang-hu|Szent István[/tpl]). She, and her sister ships, were regarded as very compact and powerful ships and were the first dreadnoughts in service with triple main-gun turrets.[tpl]sfn|Sieche|1985|p=334[/tpl]
Her completion was delayed by the start of World War I, but she was commissioned in December 1915. She spent the bulk of the war at anchor in Pola (Pula), leaving harbour generally only for gunnery training. Her final mission began on the evening of 9 June 1918 when she sailed to rendezvous with the other dreadnoughts for an attack on the Otranto Barrage, scheduled for the following day. Two Italian MAS, a type of Motor Torpedo Boat employed by the Regia Marina, discovered Szent István and her half-sister [tpl]SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|2[/tpl] early in the morning of 10 June 1918 while returning after a night patrol off the Dalmatian coast. They penetrated past her escorts and torpedoed her twice abreast her boiler rooms. They flooded, which knocked out power to the pumps, and Szent István capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed. All but 89 of her crew were rescued. She is the only battleship whose sinking was filmed during World War I.
Her wreck was discovered in the mid-1970s, upside down, off the Croatian island of Premuda. She has been declared a protected site by the Croatian Ministry of Culture and casual diving is forbidden.

[[Arripis]]

CATEGORIES: Arripidae, Sport fish, Fish of Australia, Fish of New Zealand, Commercial fish

Arripis is a genus of marine  fishes from Australia and New Zealand, known as Australian salmon or kahawai. They are the only members of the family Arripidae. Despite the common name, Australian salmon are not related to the salmon family Salmonidae of the Northern Hemisphere, but belong to the order Perciformes of perch-like fishes. Australian salmon were named so by early European settlers after their superficial resemblance to the salmoniform fishes.
Relatively long-lived fish, Australian salmon are a favored target of recreational fishers, and both commercial and traditional Māori fisheries. They are also common bycatch of the Australasian snapper (Pagrus auratus), mullet (Mugilidae), white trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex), and mackerel (Scombridae) fisheries. These species are all taken in great numbers by way of purse seine nets and trawling. They are also caught by skilled fishermen along the southern coastline of Australia by beach seining. Due to declining numbers and ever-increasing annual catch sizes, the future viability of the Australian salmon stock has been put into question.

Abbotsbury Abbey, dedicated to Saint Peter, was a Benedictine monastery in the village of Abbotsbury in Dorset, England. The abbey was founded in the eleventh century by King Cnut's thegn Orc and his wife Tola, who handsomely endowed the monastery with lands in the area. The abbey prospered and became a local centre of power, controlling eight manor houses and villages. During the later Middle Ages, the abbey suffered much misfortune. In the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the last abbot surrendered the abbey and the site was given to Sir Giles Strangways.
Today, the abbey's remains, and those of the nearby St Catherine's chapel, are in the guardianship of English Heritage.

[[Girolamo Dalla Casa]]

CATEGORIES: 1601 deaths, Italian composers, Renaissance composers, Venetian school composers, Italian music theorists, Year of birth unknown

Girolamo Dalla Casa (also known as Hieronymo de Udene, died 1601) was an Italian composer, instrumentalist, and writer of the late Renaissance. He was a member of the Venetian School, and was perhaps more famous and influential as a performer than as a composer.
Nothing is known about his life prior to his arrival at Venice, but he was probably born at Udine sometime before the middle of the 16th century. He was first hired by the musical establishment of St Mark's Basilica on 29 January 1568, along with his two brothers, Giovanni and Nicolò, where they formed the first permanent instrumental ensemble (Arnold and Marcialis 2001). The sonorous acoustical environment of this basilica was the center of activity of the Venetians. Giovanni Gabrieli clearly had Dalla Casa's group in mind for much of his music, and the Dalla Casas are presumed to have played in many the elaborate polychoral compositions of the time.[tpl]Cn|date=August 2013[/tpl]
In 1572, Dalla Casa served as Venetian agent for the purchase of a large number of wind instruments and printed editions of music for the court of John of Austria, half-brother of Philip II of Spain and hero of the Battle of Lepanto in the previous year. The transaction, made though the Spanish resident ambassador in Venice, Diego Guzmán de Silva, came to the considerable sum of 154 scudi, 3 lire, and 20 soldi in gold. The instruments purchased included four tenor and two soprano shawms, six alto cornetts, five mute cornetts, two large bass? cornetts, two dulcians, and trumpets from Nuremberg and Augsburg. An unusually large sum was charged for a "'cassa di flauti grossi" (chest of large recorders), which may have included several SATB consorts. The music included five printed books by Cipriano de Rore, four books by Orlando di Lasso, four books by Vincenzo Ruffo, and a collection by Pedro Guerrero, as well as other books whose contents were not specified in the receipt, which is dated 20 February 1572 and signed in Dalla Casa's hand (Levin and Zohn 2005, 439–40, 442–44).
Dalla Casa was a virtuoso player of the cornett,[tpl]Cn|date=August 2013[/tpl] which he described as 'the most excellent of all the wind instruments ... because it mimics the human voice better than the other instruments do' (Dalla Casa 1584, 1:A2 verso).
The use of the Dalla Casas by Gabrieli and St. Mark's foreshadowed, and may have influenced, the development of the concertino-ripieno style of the concerto grosso in the later Baroque. Being a smaller group of virtuoso instrumentalists playing in contrast to larger instrumental and vocal forces arrayed around them, and being in the center of a hugely influential stylistic movement, they functioned as an early form of concertino. Much of the music which Gabrieli and the other Venetians wrote for them survives.[tpl]or|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Two books of madrigals and one book of motets survive from his compositional output, which probably was not large.[tpl]Cn|date=August 2013[/tpl] More important to musicology, however, was his two-part 1584 treatise on ornamentation (Il vero modo di diminuir), which gives clear and precise examples of ornamentation as it was practiced in singing and playing French chansons and Italian madrigals at the time. In contrast to earlier ornamentation treatises, Dalla Casa introduced short ornamental patterns with jerky and discontinuous rhythms, such as the tremoli groppizati and groppi battute, to emphasize particular notes and heighten their emotional effect. Diminutions on intervalic skips of sixths, sevenths, and octaves also appear for the first time in this treatise, which is therefore regarded as marking the end of the purely Renaissance style of ornamentation and the beginnings of Baroque practice (Horsley 1951, 14–16). From this treatise it is clear that polyphonic works were usually performed unadorned,[tpl]Cn|date=August 2013[/tpl] but works in a more homophonic style, and especially grand polychoral works with frequent sectional changes and prominent cadences, were embellished with ornaments, few of which appear in the actual notated music.[tpl]Clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]

[[1987 Formula One season]]
CATEGORIES: Formula One seasons, 1987 in Formula One

The 1987 Formula One season was the 38th season of Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1987 FIA Formula One World Championship for Drivers and Constructors which commenced on 12 April 1987 and ended on 15 November after sixteen races. This championship also encompassed the Jim Clark Trophy and the Colin Chapman Trophy which were contested respectively by drivers and constructors of Formula One cars powered by naturally aspirated engines.
The 1987 World Championship featured a season long duel between the two Williams drivers: Brazilian two-time champion Nelson Piquet and British driver Nigel Mansell. The pair won nine of the season's sixteen races in their Williams FW11Bs, although they had only one win from the first five races. Their mid-season dominance eliminated all competition however. Mansell took six wins compared to the more consistent Piquet with three. The increasingly antagonistic duel came to a premature end at the Japanese Grand Prix when Mansell crashed heavily in practice incurring a back injury that put him out for the two races left in the season.
The battle for third in the championship was also resolved late in the season, with Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna driving a Lotus 99T finished nine points clear of outgoing world champion Frenchman Alain Prost (McLaren MP4/3).
Williams-Honda dominated the Constructors' Championship, claiming 137 points compared to McLaren-TAG on 76 points. Lotus-Honda claimed third in the points resisting a late season charge from Ferrari led by Austrian driver Gerhard Berger who won the final two races of the year in Japan and Australia.
Two new sub-championships were created for the 1987 season. The Jim Clark Trophy for drivers of cars powered by naturally aspirated engines and its parallel championship for constructors, the Colin Chapman Trophy, helped encourage the teams who did not have access to turbocharged engines, while at the same time acknowledging the forthcoming ban on turbos for the 1989 Formula One season. British driver Jonathan Palmer (Tyrrell DG016) won the championship, wrapping it up early in Japan and finishing 21 points ahead of his French teammate Philippe Streiff. As Tyrrell was the only two-car team in the Colin Chapman trophy, they dominated. Philippe Alliot's results in the Larrousse-entered Lola LC87 were sufficient to earn him third place in the Jim Clark Trophy and Lola second in the Colin Chapman Trophy.
1987 saw new rules introduced in an effort to not only make the returning normally aspirated more competitive, but to reduce costs and also slow the cars down with a resultant increase in safety. As part of a two-year plan to phase turbos out of Formula One, the FIA introduced a mandatory pop-off valve to the turbo powered cars which restricted boost to 4.0 bar, thus limiting engine power (one unnamed team manager was heard to remark at the season opener in Brazil that the pop-off valve was "the only crude piece of engineering on a modern Grand Prix car", while another said that the FIA would not get rid of the valves as it would rob them of getting their stickers on the cars for free). However, advances in engine development, aerodynamics, tyres and suspension meant that, despite the turbo limit, the leading teams such as Williams, McLaren and Ferrari regularly recorded faster times than they had in 1986 when turbo boost was unrestricted. The FIA also banned the super soft (and sticky) qualifying tyres in 1987, which eliminated the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.

The peso (ISO 4217 code: CUP, sometimes called the "national peso" or in Spanish moneda nacional) is one of two official currencies in use in Cuba, the other being the convertible peso (ISO 4217 code: CUC, occasionally referred to as "dollar" in spoken language). It is subdivided into 100 centavos.
Cuban state workers receive a portion of their wages in convertible pesos, the rest in national pesos. Shops selling basics, like fruit and vegetables, generally accept only the normal peso, while "dollar shops" sell the rest. The word "pesos" may refer to both non-convertible and convertible money. Cuban convertible pesos are 25 times more valuable, but this does not completely eliminate the confusion for tourists: since goods bought in national pesos have controlled prices, tourists are sometimes confused by prices perceived as "too cheap."

[[History of the Royal Navy]]
CATEGORIES: History of the Royal Navy

The History of the Royal Navy can be traced back to before the ninth century AD. However, the present Royal Navy was formally created as the national naval force of the Kingdom of England in 1660, following the Restoration of King Charles II to the throne. In 1707 it became the naval force of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Union between England and Scotland which merged the English Navy with the much smaller Royal Scots Navy, although the two had begun operating together from the time of the Union of the Crowns in 1603.
The English Navy had no defined moment of formation; it started out as a motley assortment of "King's ships" during the Middle Ages assembled only as needed and then dispersed, began to take shape as a standing navy during the 16th century, and became a regular establishment during the tumults of the 17th century.  The Navy grew considerably during the global struggle with France that started in 1690 and culminated in the Napoleonic Wars, a time when the practice of fighting under sail was developed to its highest point.
The ensuing century of general peace saw considerable technological development, with sail yielding to steam and cannon supplanted by large shell-firing guns, and ending with the race to construct bigger and better battleships. That race, however, was ultimately a dead end, as aircraft carriers and submarines came to the fore and, after the successes of World War II, the Royal Navy yielded its formerly preeminent place to the United States Navy. The Royal Navy has remained one of the world's most capable navies, however, and currently operates a large fleet of modern ships.

The convertible peso (sometimes given as CUC$) (informally called a cuc' or "chavito"'), is one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the peso. It has been in limited use since 1994, when it was treated as equivalent to the U.S. dollar: its value was officially US$1.00. On 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar ceased to be accepted in Cuban retail outlets leaving the convertible peso as the only currency in circulation in many Cuban businesses. Officially exchangeable only within the country, its value was increased to US$1.08 on 5 April 2008, and reverted to US$1.00 on 15 March 2011. The convertible peso is, by the pegged rate, the twelfth-highest-valued currency unit in the world and the highest valued "peso" unit.
On 22 October 2013, it was announced that the currency is to be scrapped by gradually unifying it with the lower value Cuban peso.[tpl]citeweb|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24627620|title= Cuba to scrap two-currency system in latest reform|publisher= BBC News|date= October 22, 2013|accessdate= October 22, 2013[/tpl]

A wealth tax is generally conceived of as a levy based on the aggregate value of all household assets, including owner-occupied housing; cash, bank deposits, money funds, and savings in insurance and pension plans; investment in real estate and unincorporated businesses; and corporate stock, financial securities, and personal trusts.Edward N. Wolff, "Time for a Wealth Tax?", Boston Review, Feb-Mar 1996 (recommending a net wealth tax for the US of 0.05% for the first $100,000 in assets to 0.3% for assets over $1,000,000 A wealth tax is a tax on the accumulated stock of purchasing power, in contrast to income tax, which is a tax on the flow of assets (a change in stock).

[[Lola Bobesco]]
CATEGORIES: 1921 births, 2003 deaths, Belgian classical violinists, Belgian people of Romanian descent, People from Craiova, Romanian classical violinists, Royal Conservatory of Brussels faculty, Royal Conservatory of Liège faculty

Lola Violeta Ana-Maria Bobesco (9 August 1921 –4 September 2003) was a Belgian violinist of Romanian origin.
She was born in Craiova, Romania, and began her career as a child prodigy, giving her first recital there at the age of 6 with her father, composer and conductor Aurel Bobesco.  She continued her studies at the Ecole Normale Musique de Paris (1928-1935) with Marcel Chailley (violin), and at the Conservatoire de Paris (1931-1935) with Jules Bucher, where she gained her first prize in 1934, and graduated with the "Prix d'Excellence."  She took private violin lessons with George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud. She became known internationally after appearing in Paris (1936) aged 17 with the Colonne Orchestra under the baton of Paul Paray, where she performed a concerto by Romanian composer Stan Golestan.  The following year, 1937, she obtained the seventh prize at the Eugène Ysaÿe contest.
Although established abroad even before the end of World War II, she returned to Romania and regularly appeared in concerts with the Radio Philharmonic in Bucharest, and the provinces in Craiova, Brasov, Iasi, Timisoara.
She founded two musical groups in Belgium: in 1958, the Orchestre Royal de Chambre de Wallonie in Liège; and in 1990, the string quartet L'Arte del Suono in Brussels.
She was also a professor at the French-language Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles and professor of violin at the Conservatory of Liège (1962-1974).  She was on the jury of the Queen Elizabeth Competition in 1971 and 1993. She recorded sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, Gabriel Fauré, Johannes Brahms, César Franck and Claude Debussy, and also baroque music including concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach.  She also worked with major orchestral ensembles of the world, including: Berlin and London Philharmonics, French orchestra Colonne, Lamoureux and Pas de loup, Concertgebouw Orchestra (Amsterdam), La Suisse Romande (Geneva), and the Orchestra Accademia Santa Cecilia (Rome). At concert and chamber music recitals, she was often accompanied by pianist Jacques Genty.
A violinist of exceptional artistic force in spite of her delicate physique, Bobesco balanced technical virtuosity with simplicity and interpretative austerity. Purity of lyrical expression, clear intonation, warm communicative musical phrasing, and originality of conception put her among the top international female performers. She recorded for Decca, Columbia, Les Discophiles Français, Nippon Program Arcophon, and others.
She died in Spa, Belgium.
The street 'Rue Lola Bobesco' that encircles behind the cultural centre at the Brussels commune of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, is named after her.

Hurricane Faith reached the northernmost latitude and had the longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23. About 42 hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), before weakening slightly on August 26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.
By August 28, the storm began to re-intensify, after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. At 0000 UTC on the following day, Faith peaked as a 125 mph (205 km/h) Category 3 hurricane Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Eventually, the storm weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane and re-curved to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sunk. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained nearly the same intensity as a Category 2 hurricane for several days, while tracking northeastward into the far North Atlantic Ocean. Faith finally weakened while north of Scotland and became extratropical near the Faroe Islands on September 6. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm.

Prince Charming
is a stock character who appears in a number of fairy tales.  He is the prince who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress, and stereotypically, must engage in a quest to liberate her from an evil spell.  This classification suits most heroes of a number of traditional folk tales,  including Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, even if in the original story they were given another name, or no name at all.
These characters are often handsome and romantic, a foil to the heroine, and are seldom deeply characterized, or even distinguishable from other such men who marry the heroine.
In many variants, they can be viewed more as rewards for the heroine rather than characters.Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale, p 121, ISBN 0-465-04125-6
"Prince Charming" is also used as a term to refer to the idealized man some people dream of as a future spouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prince%20charming |title=Prince charming |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Merriam-Webster online |accessdate=22 September 2010[/tpl]

The Wonderbra is a type of push-up underwire brassiere that gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s. Although the Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955,[tpl]Cite web | url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=registration&entry=612231 | title=Trademark Status & Document Retrieval | publisher = United States Trademark and Patent Office | accessdate=2007-02-03[/tpl] the brand was developed in Canada. Moses (Moe) Nadler, founder and majority owner of the Canadian Lady Corset Company, licensed the trademark for the Canadian market in 1939. By the 1960s the Canadian Lady brand had become known in Canada as "Wonderbra, the company." In 1961 the company introduced the Model 1300 plunge push-up bra. This bra became one of the best-selling Canadian styles and is virtually identical to today's Wonderbra.
In 1968, Canadian Lady changed its name to Canadian Lady-Canadelle Inc., was sold to Consolidated Foods (now Sara Lee Corporation), and later became Canadelle Inc. During the 1970s Wonderbra was repositioned as the company's fashionable and sexy brand, and became the Canadian market leader.Mintzberg (1984), p. 76.
In 1991, the push-up Wonderbra became a sensation in the UK, although it had been sold there since 1964 under license by the Gossard division of Courtaulds Textiles. Sara Lee Corporation did not renew Gossard's license and redesigned the push-up style for the reintroduction of the Wonderbra to the U.S. market in 1994.[tpl]Cite news| last = Bowes | first = Elana | title = Playtex, Gossard gird themselves for battle of bras | publisher = Advertising Age | date = 1993-10-11[/tpl]
Since 1994, the Wonderbra has expanded from the single push-up design into a full-range lingerie fashion label in most of the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products—a departure from the strategy that made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.wonderbra.ca | title=Wonderbra Canada Website | year = 2007 | accessdate=2007-02-03[/tpl]

[[History of Hampshire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Hampshire, History of England by county

[tpl]No footnotes|date=July 2010[/tpl]400px|thumb|Hampshire in 1832
Hampshire is a county in Southern England with some notable archaeology and many notable historic buildings.
The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the neolithic, and these settlers built hill forts such as Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an area named Gwent or Y Went by the Celts, which also covered areas of Somerset and Wiltshire.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] In the Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces. The county was occupied by Jutish tribes until Saxon times. Hampshire was one of the first Saxon shires, recorded in 755, but for two centuries represented the western end of Saxon England, as advances into Dorset and Somerset were fought off by the Britons. After the Saxons advanced west Hampshire became the centre of the Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the 9th century.
After the Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the New Forest as a hunting forest.
The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds.  These later consolidated to 37. These were Alton, Andover, Barmanstip, Barton Stacy, Basingstoke, Bedbridge, Bondsborough, Bosmere, Buddlesgate, Christchurch, Chutely, Crondall, East Meon, Evinger, Fawley, Finchdean, Fordingbridge, Hambledon, Heling, Holdsett, King's Somborne, Kingsclear, Mansbridge, Meanstoke, Micheldever, New Forest, Odiham, Overton, Pastrow, Portsdown, Ringwood, Shelbourn, Sutton, Thorngate, Titchfield, Waltham and Wherwell.
Over several centuries a series of castles and forts were constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Norman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the Mayflower and the Titanic, the latter being crewed largely by Hampshire natives.
Hampshire played a large role in World War II due to its large Royal Navy harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the British Army's main permanent camps.
The county has in the past been called "Southamptonshire" and appears as such on some Victorian maps. The name of the administrative county was changed from 'County of Southampton' to 'County of Hampshire' on 1 April 1959. The short form of the name, often used in postal addresses, is Hants.
The old name appears as the place of embarkation of many of the immigrants into Ellis Island.  It is recorded in the 'Commonwealth Instrument of Government, 1653 http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1653intrumentgovt.html', which was adopted by Oliver Cromwell when he assumed the office of 'Lord Protector' in 1654.
The Isle of Wight has been for some purposes in the past treated traditionally part of Hampshire, but has been administered separately from Hampshire for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. The island is excluded from the hundreds given above – it was traditionally divided into East Medina and West Medina hundreds. Apart from a shared police force there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire.
The towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch also fall within the historic county of Hampshire, but were ceded to Dorset in the local government reorganisation of 1974.

Masking tape, also known as sticky tape, is a type of pressure-sensitive tape made of a thin and easy-to-tear paper, and an easily released pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is available in a variety of widths. It is used mainly in painting, to mask off areas that should not be painted. The adhesive is the key element to its usefulness, as it allows the tape to be easily removed without leaving residue or damaging the surface to which it is applied. The tape is available in several strengths, rated on a 1–100 scale based on the strength of the adhesive. Most painting operations will require a tape in the 50 range. Household masking tape is made of an even weaker paper and lower-grade adhesive.

[[Powers That Be (Angel)]]
CATEGORIES: Angel (TV series) characters, Fictional deities, Fictional portrayals of God

The Powers That Be is a title for the enigmatic and ancient forces that assist the side of good in the WB television series Angel. 
The first mention of The Powers That Be (sometimes shortened to the Powers or the PTB) comes in the first episode of Angel, when a half-human, half-demon named Doyle makes contact with Angel and claims that the Powers send him visions of people in trouble who need Angel's help.  The visions are extremely powerful, come at seemingly random times, and cause extreme pain in the recipient.
Though Angel never makes contact with the Powers themselves, he does communicate with them in a number of ways.
The Powers that Be are also referred to by Fred as "The Powers that Screw You" and by Gunn as "The Powers that Sit on Their Be-hinds," due to their apparent inaction during many times of crisis that Angel Investigations faces; Angel and Jasmine also complain about their lack of interest in important events.  Doyle, Cordelia, Wesley and Lorne appear much more concerned with doing their will.
In "You're Welcome", Cordelia dies, but the Powers owe her one for an unspecified reason (probably because of the Jasmine issue), and she convinces them to send her spirit back in physical form to help Angel one last time as repayment.  Cordelia helps him defeat Lindsey MacDonald and prevent the Partners' failsafe from being released.  Cordelia admits she loves Angel and kisses him, secretly using her powers to give him a vision of what he needs to defeat, and disappears after telling him, "you're welcome" and that he has to answer the phone call that informs Angel that she died earlier that day.
The canonical continuation of the series (Angel: After The Fall) states that after her death, Cordelia has become a genuine Higher Being in the service of the Powers, though she does not have the power to go up against the Senior Partners or to help Angel and the others, who are trapped in Hell/Los Angeles.
The Powers play a pivotal role in Angel: After the Fall#12 and Angel: After the Fall#13, specifically. Cordelia manages to arrive in Hell/Los Angeles to assist Angel, as an attack by Gunn leaves Angel badly wounded. After receiving a vision of the future from Wolfram & Hart via Wesley, Angel believes that The Powers want him to leave with Cordelia (elect to die) in order to save mankind from his role in the Apocalypse. Instead, however, intervention by Connor and the support of Cordelia rallies Angel, and as he "runs away from the light" she begins to fade away. Before vanishing Cordelia gives Angel one final boost as she says, "Be good, big guy!" before finally fading away.Angel: After the Fall #13 pp. 16-17

Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod (20 March 1782 – 18 November 1835) was an English-born officer of the British East India Company and an Oriental scholar. He combined his official role and his amateur interests to create a series of works about the history and geography of India, and in particular the area then known as Rajputana that corresponds to the present day state of Rajasthan, and which Tod referred to as Rajas'han.
Tod was born in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a military officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod was involved in the intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region under the control of the East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.
Back home in England, Tod published a number of academic works about Indian history and geography, most notably Annals and Antiquities of Rajas'han, based on materials collected during his travels. He retired from the military in 1826, and married Julia Clutterbuck that same year. He died in 1835, aged 53.
Tod's major works have been criticised as containing significant inaccuracies and bias, but he is highly regarded in some areas of India, particularly in communities whose ancestors he praised. His accounts of the Rajputs and of India in general had a significant effect on British views of the area for many years.

He finished his college career with 28 goals and 18 assists.
Upon graduating, Detter was selected 47th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Kansas City Wizards.

[[Private good]]

A private good is defined in economics as "an item that yields positive benefits to people"[tpl]cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|title=Intermediate Microeconomics And Its Application|year=2004|publisher=South-Western, a division of Thomson Learning|location=United States of America|isbn=0-324-27419-X|pages=59[/tpl] that is excludable, i.e. its owners can exercise private property rights, preventing those who have not paid for it from using the good or consuming its benefits; and rivalrous, i.e. consumption by one necessarily prevents that of another. A private good, as an economic resource is scarce, which can cause competition for it.Hallgren,M.M.,McAdams A.K.,1995. A model for efficient aggregation of resources for economic public goods on the internet.

Unlike public goods, private goods are less likely to have the free rider problem. Assuming a private good is valued positively by everyone, the efficiency of obtaining the good is obstructed by its rivalry, that is simultaneous consumption of a rivalrous good is theoretically impossible; the feasibility of obtaining the good is made difficult by its excludability, that is people have to pay for it to enjoy its benefits.Malkin,J. & ,Wildavasky,A.,1991. Why the traditional distinction between public and private goods should be abandoned. Journal of Theoretical Politics. doi: 10.1177/0951692891003004001
One of the most common ways of looking at goods in the economy, illustrated in the table below, is by examining the level of competition in obtaining a given good, and the possibility of excluding its consumption; one cannot, for example, prevent another from enjoying a beautiful view, or clean air.Rivalry and Excludability in Goods.

[[History of Bristol]]

CATEGORIES: History of Bristol, History of England by county, History of Gloucestershire

Bristol is a city with a population of nearly half a million people in south west England, situated between Somerset and Gloucestershire on the tidal River Avon. It has been amongst the country's largest and most economically and culturally important cities for eight centuries.  The Bristol area has been settled since the Stone Age and there is evidence of Roman occupation. A mint was established in the Saxon burgh of Brycgstow by the 10th century and the town rose to prominence in the Norman era, gaining a charter and county status in 1373. The change in the form of the name 'Bristol' is due to the local pronunciation of 'ow' as 'ol'.
Maritime connections to Wales, Ireland, Iceland, western France, Spain and Portugal brought a steady increase in trade in wool, fish, wine and grain during the Middle Ages. Bristol became a city in 1542 and trade across the Atlantic developed. The city was captured by Royalist troops and then recaptured for Parliament during the English Civil War. During the 17th and 18th centuries the transatlantic slave trade and the Industrial Revolution brought further prosperity. Edmund Burke, MP for Bristol,  supported the American Revolution and free trade. Prominent reformers such as Mary Carpenter and Hannah More campaigned against the slave trade.
The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the construction of a floating harbour, advances in shipbuilding and further industrialisation with the growth of the glass, paper, soap and chemical industries aided by the establishment of Bristol as the terminus of the Great Western Railway by I. K. Brunel. In the early 20th century, Bristol was in the forefront of aircraft manufacture and the city had become an important financial centre and high technology hub by the beginning of the 21st century.

[[Charles Fearne]]

CATEGORIES: 1742 births, 1794 deaths, British legal professionals, People educated at Westminster School, London

Charles Fearne (1742–1794) was an English jurist.
The son of Charles Fearne, judge-advocate of the admiralty, he was born in London, and was educated at Westminster School.  His 1772 work, "Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders and Executory Devices", is deemed to have done "more than any other to preserve the Rule in Shelley's Case as black letter law (as distinguished from a rule of construction)."[tpl]ref|10thcircuit[/tpl]
Fearn  adopted the legal profession, but, though well-fitted by his talents to succeed as a barrister, he neglected his profession and devoted most of his attention and his patrimony to the prosecution of scientific experiments, with the vain hope of achieving discoveries which would reward him for his pains and expense. His Essay on the Learning of Contingent Remainders and Executory Devises, the work which has made his reputation as a legal authority, and which has passed through numerous editions, was called forth by a decision of Lord Mansfield in the case of Perrin v. Blake, and had the effect of reversing that decision.
He died in 1794, leaving his widow and family in necessitous circumstances. A volume entitled Fearne's Posthumous Works was published by subscription in 1797 for the benefit of his widow.

[[British Seafarers' Union]]

CATEGORIES: 1911 establishments in the United Kingdom, Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom, Maritime trade unions, Breakaway trade unions, Water transport in the United Kingdom

The British Seafarers' Union (BSU) was a trade union which organised sailors and firemen in the British ports of Southampton and Glasgow between 1911/1912 and 1922. Although of considerable local importance, the organisation remained much smaller and less influential at a national level than the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union, (NSFU).
The BSU was formed in Southampton on 6 October 1911, as a breakaway from the NSFU. In August 1912, a second breakaway took place in Glasgow, and a branch of the BSU was established in that port.
The cause of the split was ostensibly the same in both ports: the rebels claimed that the NSFU was reckless and extravagant with its funds, that members had little control over the direction of the organisation, and that its leading officials were unaccountable. The NSFU itself vigorously denied these allegations. It accused the BSU of sectionalism, and of being the product of the political ambitions of its leading officials, Tommy Lewis and Manny Shinwell.
In June 1912, the BSU took part in the national dock strike of 1912. The NSFU, although affiliated to the body which had called the strike, the National Transport Workers' Federation, refused to support the strike except in London.
Unlike the NSFU, the BSU was not granted a role on the National Maritime Board which was formed in 1917 to decide on working practices in the merchant shipping industry.  In May 1921, the Board imposed wage reductions which were resisted by both the BSU and the National Union of Ship's Stewards. Later that year, these two organisations were merged to form the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union, (AMWU).

[[Computable function]]
CATEGORIES: Computability theory, Theory of computation

Computable functions are the basic objects of study in computability theory. Computable functions are the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm. They are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.
Particular models of computability that give rise to the set of computable functions are the Turing-computable functions and the μ-recursive functions.
Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable.   This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. Note that the effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be efficiently computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially (or even superexponentially) with the length of the input. The fields of feasible computability and computational complexity study functions that can be computed efficiently.
According to the Church–Turing thesis, computable functions are exactly the functions that can be calculated using a mechanical calculation device given unlimited amounts of time and storage space. Equivalently, this thesis states that any function which has an algorithm is computable.  Note that an algorithm in this sense is understood to be a sequence of steps a person with unlimited time and an infinite supply of pen and paper could follow.
The Blum axioms can be used to define an abstract computational complexity theory on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of determining the complexity of a computable function is known as a function problem.

[[Titanosaur]]

CATEGORIES: Titanosaurs

Titanosaurs (members of the groups Titanosauria or Titanosauroidea) were a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs, which included Saltasaurus and Isisaurus. It includes some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth, such as Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus — which are believed to have weighed up to 90 tonnes (100 short tons). Consequently, they were named titanosaurs in honor of the mythological Titans, the early deities of Ancient Greece. Together with the brachiosaurids and relatives, they make up the larger clade Titanosauriformes.

[[William Gilbert (rugby)]]
CATEGORIES: English businesspeople, Rugby football, 1799 births, 1877 deaths

William Gilbert (1799 – 1877) established Gilbert company, the manufacturer of sports equipment, in 1823. Gilbert had a boot and shoemakers shop in the high street next to Rugby School and started making balls for the school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pig bladders. 
It is the shape of the pig’s bladder that is reputed to have given the rugby ball its distinctive oval shape although balls of those days were more plum shaped than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig’s bladder was and in those early days William's nephew James who was famed for his extraordinary lung power,Oliver Price. Blood, mud and aftershave in The Observer Sunday February 5, 2006, Section B is for Ball  inflated the balls. It was not a job that was sought after, the pig’s bladder would be blown up while still in its very smelly ‘green state’, solely by lungpower, down the stem of a clay pipe which was inserted into the opening of the bladder.
If the pig was diseased, it was possible to develop lung diseases from blowing up the balls. The wife of Richard Lindon, another man who also made balls for Rugby School, died from an infection caught from an infected pigs bladder. This spurred Lindon in the mid-1860s to pioneer the "rubber bladder", the Brass Hand pump inflator and finally the advent of shape standardisation.
When William died his nephew James succeeded him. And he has another nephew named Daniel.

[[History of Cheshire]]

CATEGORIES: Cheshire, History of Cheshire, History of England by county

The history of Cheshire can be traced back to the Hoxnian Interglacial, between 38,000 BC and 40,000 BC. Primitive tools that date to that period have been found. Stone Age remains has been found showing more permanent habitation during the Neolithic period, and by the Iron Age the area is known to have been occupied by the Celtic Cornovii tribe and possibly the Deceangli [tpl]cite book|title=Roman Manchester|author1=Jones, B.|author2=Grealey, S.|author3=Bestwick, J.D.|year=1974|publisher=Sherratt for Manchester Excavation Committee|isbn=9780854270415|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsPnAAAAIAAJ[/tpl].
The Romans occupied Cheshire for almost 400 years, from 70 AD, and created the town and fort of Deva Victrix, now Chester. After the Romans withdrew, Cheshire formed part of Mercia, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, that saw invasions from the Welsh and Danes. The Norman Conquest in 1070 saw Cheshire harshly ruled by the occupiers as local people resented the invaders and rebelled. War again swept the county during the English Civil War in 1642, despite an attempt by local gentry to keep the county neutral.
The industrial revolution saw population changes in Cheshire as farm workers moved to the factories of Manchester and Lancashire. In the 18th and 19th centuries there was a resurgence in the country houses of Cheshire and canals and railways were built.
Contemporary Cheshire is now a ceremonial county administered by four unitary authorities; Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. (Warrington, formerly in Lancashire, was added to Chesire in 1974.)   Cheshire retains the offices of Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for ceremonial purposes.

[[History of Cornwall]]
CATEGORIES: History of Cornwall, Military history of Cornwall, History of England by county

The history of Cornwall begins with the pre-Roman inhabitants, including speakers of a Celtic language, Common Brittonic, that would develop into Southwestern Brittonic and then the Cornish language. Cornwall was part of the territory of the tribe of the Dumnonii that included modern-day Devon and parts of Somerset. After a period of Roman rule, Cornwall reverted to rule by independent Romano-British princes and continued to have a close relationship with Brittany and Wales as well as southern Ireland, which neighboured across the Celtic Sea. After the collapse of Dumnonia, the remaining territory of Cornwall came into conflict with neighbouring Wessex.
By the time of the Norman conquest of England, Cornwall had fallen under the control of the Kingdom of England. In 1337, the title Duke of Cornwall was created by the English monarchy, to be held by the king's eldest son and heir. Cornwall, along with the neighbouring county of Devon, maintained Stannary institutions that granted some local control over its most important product, tin, but by the time of Henry VIII most vestiges of Cornish autonomy had been removed as England became an increasingly centralised state under the Tudor dynasty. Conflicts with the centre took place with the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 and Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549.
By the 18th century, Cornwall was incorporated into the Kingdom of Great Britain along with the rest of England and the Cornish language had gone into steep decline. The Industrial Revolution brought huge change to Cornwall, as well as the adoption of methodism among the general populace, turning the area nonconformist. Decline of mining in Cornwall resulted in mass emigration overseas and the Cornish diaspora, as well as the start of the Celtic Revival and Cornish revival which resulted in the beginnings of Cornish nationalism in the late 20th century.
Cornwall's Early Medieval history, in particular the early Welsh and Breton references to a Cornish "king" named Arthur, have featured in such legendary works as Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, predating the Arthurian legends of the Matter of Britain (see the list of legendary rulers of Cornwall).

The Treaty of Zgorzelec (Full title The Agreement Concerning the Demarcation of the Established and the Existing Polish-German State Frontier, also known as the Treaty of Görlitz and Treaty of Zgorzelic) between the Republic of Poland and East Germany (GDR) was signed on 6 July 1950 in Polish Zgorzelec, since 1945 the eastern part of the divided city of Görlitz. 
The agreement was signed under Soviet pressure by Otto Grotewohl, prime minister of the provisional government of the GDR (East Germany) and Polish premier Józef Cyrankiewicz. It recognized the Oder-Neisse line implemented by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement as the border between the two states. Johnson, Edward Elwyn.  International law aspects of the German refunification alternative answers to the German question Page 13 The terms referred to the "defined and existing border" from the Baltic Sea west of Świnoujście - however without mentioning Szczecin - along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers to the Czechoslovak border. Thereby the East German government also accepted the division of Küstrin, Frankfurt (Oder), Guben and Görlitz.
The treaty was worded as a declaration and was not recognised as a legitimate international treaty by West Germany insisting on its exclusive mandate and the members states of the NATO. Four years later when the Soviet Union granted East Germany independence,Declaration of the Government of the U.S.S.R. Concerning the Granting of Sovereignty to the German Democratic Republic, 25 March, 1954 the Soviet Union reserved rights over East Germany (similar to the rights reserved by the Western Allies over the West Germany under the Bonn–Paris conventions) pending a final peace treaty with Germany  - the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. So although the treaty was binding on the two states it was not seen by many western members of the international community as a definitive. The West German government stressed the status of the territories east of the Oder-Neisse-line being "under Polish and Soviet administration" until in 1970 Chancellor Willy Brandt by signing the Treaty of Warsaw de facto acknowledged the border. Reunited Germany accepted the Polish annexations by the German–Polish Border Treaty (1990). 
The community centre in which the treaty was signed is one of Zgorzelec's main sights and is found in a park beside the road bridge border crossing.

[[History of Derbyshire]]
CATEGORIES: History of Derbyshire, History of England by county

Derbyshire was traditionally divided into six hundreds, namely Appletree, High Peak, Morleyston and Litchurch, Repton and Gresley, Scarsdale, Wirksworth.  These were based on the seven earlier wapentakes recorded in the Domesday Book, with the merging of Repton and Gresley wapentakes.
Derbyshire came into existence at the same time as Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire (see the histories of each for details) as an administrative division of the Kingdom of Mercia. The actual date for this is unclear but would be in the mid to late 10th Century. Evidence of this division can be seen from the map layout around the village of No Mans Heath where the four counties still effectively meet.
Derbyshire had a detached part in north-western Leicestershire, surrounding Measham and Donisthorpe.  This escaped regularisation in 1844, and was incorporated into Leicestershire in 1888 when the county councils were set up.  The thin strip of Leicestershire between the exclave and Derbyshire, containing Overseal and Netherseal, is now considered part of Derbyshire.
Apart from this, some parishes in historic Derbyshire, including Dore, Norton and Totley, are now in the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire.

The Rouse Company, founded by Hunter Moss and James W. Rouse in 1939, was a publicly held shopping mall and community developer from 1956 until 2004, when General Growth Properties Inc. purchased the company.
The Moss-Rouse Company was founded as a FHA mortgage company with a loan from Hunter Moss's sister. Rouse leveraged his knowledge as loan guarantee specialist at the Federal Housing Administration to establish a Baltimore-based mortgage company specializing in FHA backed loans. Moss-Rouse hired a WWII Navy friend hired Churchill G. Carey from Connecticut General, who in turn provided capitol for future projects. Carey would hold positions ranging from president to CEO of the mortgage company subsidiary .[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=5 April 2008[/tpl] Upon hiring of Jim Rouse's brother in 1952, Hunter Ross sold his share of the company renaming the firm the James W Rouse Company.[tpl]cite book|title=Jim Rouse: Capitalist/idealist|page=39|author=Paul Marx[/tpl]
The Rouse Company built some of the first enclosed shopping malls, and it pioneered the development of festival marketplaces, such as Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Faneuil Hall in Boston, South Street Seaport in New York City, Waterside in Norfolk, Harborplace in Baltimore, and Bayside Marketplace in Miami. They also developed The Shops at National Place in downtown Washington, D.C. that opened in 1984-85.
The company has also been credited as the pioneer of the first successful food court in an enclosed shopping mall, when the food court at the Sherway Mall in Toronto opened for business in 1971. It followed an unsuccessful attempt at the Plymouth Meeting Mall in 1968, which reportedly failed because it was "deemed too small and insufficiently varied."
Its community projects include the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore and the planned cities of Columbia, Maryland (where it was headquartered), Bridgeland Community, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada. 
Howard Research and Development was formed as a subsidiary to facilitate the Columbia Project with Connecticut General and Chase Manhattan as stakeholder with interest deferred loans. In 1966 The James W Rouse Company was restructured as the Rouse Company, adding HRD as a separate entity shielded Rouse Corporation from debt liability of the Columbia development. Columbia Development Corporation was formed a subsidiary of HRD using subcontracted Rouse Company employees. In 1985 CIGNA (Connecticut General) divested it's interest in HRD and the project back to Rouse for $120 million at a net loss.[tpl]cite book|title=Better Places, Better Lives|author=Joshua Olsen|page=237[/tpl]

In American and Canadian gridiron football, pass interference (PI) is a foul that occurs when a player interferes with an eligible receiver's ability to make a fair attempt to catch a forward pass. Pass interference may include tripping, pushing, pulling, or cutting in front of the receiver or pulling on the receiver's arms. It does not include catching or batting the ball before it reaches the receiver. Once the ball touches any defensive player or eligible offensive receiver the above rules no longer apply and the defender may tackle the receiver or attempt to prevent him from gaining control of the ball.
Once a forward pass is in the air it is a loose ball and thus any eligible receiver – all defensive players are eligible receivers – may try to catch it. When a defensive player catches a forward pass it is an interception and his team gains possession of the ball. Some actions that are defined as pass interference may be overlooked if the defender is attempting to catch or bat the ball rather than focusing on the receiver.
The intended receiver may find himself a defender if a defensive player has a better chance to catch a forward pass. If an offensive player commits pass interference against a defensive player attempting to intercept a forward pass it is offensive pass interference.

Emperor  Hàm Nghi (born Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Lịch, 22 July 1872 in Huế – died 14 January 1943), was the eighth Emperor of the Vietnamese Nguyễn Dynasty. He reigned for only one year (1884–85).Bruce M. Lockhart, William J. Duiker Historical Dictionary of Vietnam 2006 Page 150 "Hàm Nghi (1872-1943). Emperor (r. 1884—1885) of the Nguyén dynasty after establishment of the French protectorate in 1884. Brother of Emperor Kiến Phúc, ...
On 4 July 1885, a nationwide insurrection against the French broke out under the leadership of the two regents Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết. The French stormed the palace and Tôn Thất Thuyết took Emperor Hàm Nghi and three empresses into hiding. Hàm Nghi went to the hills and jungles around Laos along with Tôn Thất Thuyết's force. While they waged guerrilla warfare against the French occupation forces, the French replaced Hàm Nghi with his brother, Đồng Khánh, who was enthroned as the Son of Heaven. In October 1888, after a series of setbacks, Hàm Nghi was hiding in an isolated house near the spring of the Nai river, with Tôn Thất Thiệp, the second son of Tôn Thất Thuyết, and only a few attendants.Spencer Tucker -Vietnam - 1999 Page 36 "In july 1885 Vietnamese nationalists acting in the name of Emperor Hàm Nghi led a brief rebellion, launching a major attack on the French at the fort of Mang Cá near the capital. This failed, whereupon Hàm Nghi fled to Quang Tri Province and ..." There, he was betrayed by the head of his Muong guards, Trương Quang Ngọc, and captured on 1 November, while Thiệp was killed. He was then turned over to French officers on 2 November.Baille, 1890; Devillers, 1998, pp. 398–469; Gosselin, 1900, pp. 150–56; Gosselin, 1904.
On 12 December 1888, he was exiled to Algeria. There he married a French Algerian woman named Marcelle Laloë on 4 November 1904. They had three children, Prince Minh-Duc, Princess Nhu May and Princess Nhu Lý. He died in 1943 and was buried in Thonac cemetery, near Sarlat, Dordogne, France.

In personam is a Latin phrase meaning "directed toward a particular person". In a lawsuit in which the case is against a specific individual, that person must be served with a summons and complaint to give the court jurisdiction to try the case, and the judgment applies to that person and is called an "in personam judgment". 
In personam is distinguished from in rem, which applies to property or "all the world" instead of a specific person. This technical distinction is important to determine where to file a lawsuit and how to serve a defendant. In personam means that a judgment can be enforceable against the person wherever he/she is. On the other hand, if the lawsuit is to determine title to property (in rem) then the action must be filed where the property exists and is only enforceable there.[tpl]cite book|last=Black|first=Henry Campbell|title=A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions of the Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern: And Including the Principal Terms of International, Constitutional, Ecclesiastical, and Commercial Law, and Medical Jurisprudence, with a Collection of Legal Maxims...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R2c8AAAAIAAJ|edition=2|year=1910|publisher=West Publishing Co.|page=606[/tpl]

[[History of the chair]]

CATEGORIES: Chairs, Cultural history

The chair is of extreme antiquity and simplicity, although for many centuries and indeed for thousands of years it was an article of state and dignity rather than an article of ordinary use. “The chair” is still extensively used as the emblem of authority in the British House of Commons and in public meetings. It was not, in fact, until the 16th century that it became common anywhere. The chest, the bench and the stool were until then the ordinary seats used in everyday living, and the number of chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most of such examples are of ecclesiastical or seigneurial origin. Our knowledge of the chairs of remote antiquity is derived almost entirely from monuments, sculpture and paintings. A few actual examples exist in the British Museum, in the Egyptian museum at Cairo, and elsewhere.

[[Stud welding]]

CATEGORIES: Arc welding

Stud welding is a similar to flash welding.where a bolt or specially formed nut is welded onto another metal part. The bolts may be automatically fed into the spot welder. Weld nuts generally have a flange with small nubs that melt to form the weld. Studs have a necked down, un-threaded area for the same purpose. Weld studs are used in stud welding systems.
Capacitor discharge weld studs range from 14 gauge to 3/8" diameter. They can come in many different lengths ranging from 1/4" to 5" and larger. The tip on the weld end of the stud serves a twofold purpose:
When the tip disintegrates, it melts and helps solidify the weld to the base material. 
Arc studs range from a #8 to 1[tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl]" diameter. The lengths are variable from 3/8" to 60" (for deformed bars). Arc studs are typically loaded with an aluminum flux ball on the weld end which aids in the welding process.
Stud welding, also known as stud arc welding, joins a stud and another piece of metal together. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud as one of the electrodes. The polarity used in stud welding depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminum, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN). 
Stud welding uses a type of flux called a ferrule, a ceramic ring which concentrates the heat generated, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed.
Portable stud welding machines are available. Welders can also be automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. Stud welding is very versatile.  Typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction. Shipbuilding is one of the oldest uses of stud welding. Stud welding revolutionized the shipbuilding industry. All other manufacturing industries can also use stud welding for a variety of purposes.
A type of stud welding called capacitor-discharge (CD) stud welding differs from regular stud welding in that capacitor-discharge welding does not require flux. The weld time is shorter, enabling the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge stud welding with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing on the opposite side of very thin metals. CD stud welding is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. On the other hand, arc stud welding is primarily for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs.

[[Wasted spark]]

CATEGORIES: Ignition systems

The wasted spark system is an ignition system used with some four-stroke cycle internal combustion engines.  In a wasted spark system, the spark plugs fire in pairs even though one is on its compression stroke and one is on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark on the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus "wasted". This design halves the number of components in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts on the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2 to 3kV to fire the cylinder on the exhaust strokes. The remaining coil energy is available to fire the spark plug under compression (typically about 8 to 12 kV).

The largest comprise a livestock show (a judged event or display in which breeding stock is exhibited), a trade fair, competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of farmers, animal fanciers, cowboys and zoologists may be displayed. The terms agricultural show and livestock show are synonymous with the North American term county fair or state fair.
Agricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and popular event in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an amusement park with those of an agricultural show. Although in many countries agriculture shows are increasingly under pressure from financial concerns, many towns have a Show Society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.
The first know agricultural show was held by Salford Agricultural Society, Lancashire, in 1768.

Having evolved from a Roman castrum in Celtic Britain, many centuries later Manchester was the site of the world's first passenger railway station and many scientific achievements of great importance. Manchester also led the political and economic reform of 19th-century Britain as the vanguard of free trade. The mid-20th century saw a decline in Manchester's industrial importance, prompting a depression in social and economic conditions. Subsequent investment, gentrification, and rebranding from the 1990s onwards changed its fortunes, and reinvigorated Manchester as a post-industrial city with multiple sporting, broadcasting, and educational institutions.
Manchester has been on a provisional list for UNESCO World Heritage City on numerous occasions. However since the 1996 bombing, local authorities have persisted on a course of economic evolution rather than prioritising the past. This economic evolution is perhaps best illustrated with the 170 metre Beetham Tower which instantly "torpedoed" any possibility of World Heritage City status according to one author.[tpl]Cite book |last=Punter |first=John |title=Urban Design and the British Urban Renaissance |page=59 |year=2009 |isbn=9780203869208[/tpl] Despite this, areas perceived as internationally important in the Industrial Revolution such as Castlefield and Ancoats have been sympathetically redeveloped.

[[History of Hertfordshire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Hertfordshire

 [tpl]quote|The history of Hertfordshire includes such a number of events of primary importance that it is somewhat difficult to make a selection of those most fitted to appear in the limited space available.—Richard Lydekker, author of Hertfordshire, writing in 1909.Lydekker 1909, p. 76.[/tpl]
 
Hertfordshire is an English county, founded in the Norse–Saxon wars of the 9th century, and developed through commerce serving London. It is a land-locked county that was several times the seat of Parliament. Today, with a population slightly over 1 million, Hertfordshire retains much of its historic character, but its industry and commerce have changed radically. From origins in brewing and papermaking, through aircraft manufacture, the county has developed a wider range of industry in which pharmaceuticals, financial services and film-making are prominent.
Although Hertfordshire is one of the historic counties of England, it does not seem to have existed as a county until the early 10th century.  Its development has been tied with that of London, which lies on its southern border.  London is the largest city in Western Europe; it requires an enormous tonnage of supplies each day and Hertfordshire grew wealthy on the proceeds of trade because no less than three of the old Roman roads serving the capital run through it, as do the Grand Union Canal and other watercourses.  More recently, rail links sprang up in the county, linking London to the north.  Hatfield in Hertfordshire has seen two rail crashes of international importance (in 1870 and 2000).
Though nowadays Hertfordshire tends to be politically conservative, historically it was the site of a number of uprisings against the Crown, particularly in the First Barons' War, the Peasants' Revolt, the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War.  The county has a rich intellectual history, and many writers of major importance, from Geoffrey Chaucer to Beatrix Potter, have connections there.  Quite a number of Prime Ministers were born or grew up in Hertfordshire.
The county contains a curiously large number of abandoned settlements, which K. Rutherford Davis attributes to a mixture of poor harvests on soil hard to farm, and the Black Death which ravaged Hertfordshire starting in 1349.

Now retired, Robertson invests directly in other hedge funds, most run by former employees of Robertson's defunct hedge fund company.
He was born in Salisbury, North Carolina in the United States. Robertson founded the investment firm Tiger Management Corp., one of the earliest hedge funds. Robertson is credited with turning $8 million in start-up capital in 1980 into over $22 billion in the late 1990s, though that was followed by a fast downward spiral of investor withdrawals that ended with the fund closing in 2000.
In 1993, his compensation and share of Tiger's gain exceeded $300 million. His 2003 estimated net worth was over $400 million, and in March 2011 it was estimated by Forbes at $2.3 billion.Julian Robertson - Forbes, Forbes.com. Accessed May 2011.

The Isle of Wight is rich in historical and archaeological sites. These range from prehistoric fossil beds which include dinosaur remains, to dwellings and artefacts of the Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman period and beyond.
The island was formed at the end of the last Ice age. A rise in global sea level flooded the former river valley of the Solent to the north and the future English Channel to the south. This cut Wight off from the island of Britain and the Continental landmass. Once open to the sea, tidal scouring widened the Solent: the sequence of tidal ingress (whether from east, west or south) remains unclear. The English Channel may have been flooded later.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

[[Solaris (band)]]
CATEGORIES: Hungarian progressive rock groups, Hungarian rock music groups, Musical groups established in 1980

Solaris is a progressive rock band from Hungary. Established in 1980, the band went through several formations. Their music has a strong melodic content, often laced with Eastern European themes, and is highlighted by the use of dynamics and extended thematic development. There is a great deal of interplay among the lead instruments of flute, guitar and keyboard which is used regularly to develop their themes. The emphasis is not on providing solo spots for the various instruments, but rather in employing those instruments within the context of the development of the individual piece.
The band's name is a reference to the Stanisław Lem sci-fi novel, Solaris. The first album's title is a reference to The Martian Chronicles. The members have said that they were influenced by these - and other - sci-fi books.
The majority of Solaris' songs are instrumentals. The first track on their first LP, Marsbéli Krónikák, is an exception, with a few lines spoken over the music. The pitch-shifting, distortion, and album's theme have led many listeners to assume that the voiceover is in a putative Martian language, but it's actually  in Hungarian: "Megrepedt tükrök (Cracked mirrors) / Kormos acélfalak (Sooty steel walls) / Halott szeméthegyek (Dead piles of garbage) / És szennyes tavak (And polluted lakes) / Azt mondod, itt élt valaha az ember? (Do you say mankind used to live here?)". 
"Egészséges Optimizmus" (Healthy Optimism) from the SOLARIS 1990 LP also has an introductory voiceover in Hungarian, and chanting in Latin[tpl]Verify source|date=July 2007[/tpl] appears in several tracks on the album Nostradamus: Próféciák könyve.
In June 2003, Attila Kollár said in an interview that the band is still alive, and they will start working on a new studio album that year.
Following their regular albums (and a live double CD recorded in 1995 during the Progfest in Los Angeles), the band also started a 3-volume "Official Bootleg" series. As the title says, these contain recordings that were never officially released before and consist of mainly live material. The title track of the second volume was originally intended to appear on the first album but has never been recorded in the studio.
In December 2007, drummer László Gömör told Alternative Press magazine that "the band has made few attempts to reunite and it seems unlikely (Solaris) will reunite."

CATEGORIES: History of Leicestershire, History of England by county

In 1087, the first recorded use of the name was as Laegrecastrescir. In the Anglo-Saxon period the area was originally in the territory of the Middle Angles and later Mercia. After the Danish invasions it was included in the Danelaw, whose boundary ran on the south-western boundary of the shire.
Leicestershire was recorded in the Domesday Book in four wapentakes: Guthlaxton, Framland, Goscote and Gartree.  These later became hundreds, with the division of Goscote into West Goscote and East Goscote, and the addition of Sparkenhoe hundred.
Leicestershire's external boundaries have changed little since the Domesday Survey.  The Measham-Donisthorpe exclave of Derbyshire has been exchanged for the Netherseal/Overseall area, and the urban expansion of Market Harborough has caused Little Bowdon, previously in Northamptonshire to be annexed.

[[History of Lincolnshire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Lincolnshire, History of England by county

Lincolnshire, England derived from the merging of the territory of the ancient Kingdom of Lindsey with that controlled by the Danelaw borough Stamford.  For some time the entire county was called 'Lindsey', and it is recorded as such in the Domesday Book.  Later, Lindsey was applied only the northern core, around Lincoln, and emerged as one of the three 'Parts of Lincolnshire', along with the Parts of Holland in the south-east and Kesteven in the south west.
In 1888 when county councils were set up, Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven each received their own separate one.  These survived until 1974, when Holland, Kesteven, and most of Lindsey were merged into Lincolnshire, and the northern part, with Scunthorpe and Grimsby, going to the newly formed non-metropolitan county of Humberside, along with most of the East Riding of Yorkshire.
A further local government reform in 1996 abolished Humberside, and the parts south of the Humber became the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire.  These areas became part of Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes such as the Lord-Lieutenancy, but are not covered by the Lincolnshire police.  These two authorities are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.
The remaining districts of Lincolnshire are Boston, East Lindsey, Lincoln, South Holland, South Kesteven, North Kesteven and West Lindsey.  They are part of the East Midlands region.

[[Division of Barker]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of Australia, Constituencies established in 1903, 1903 establishments in Australia

The Division of Barker is an Australian Electoral Division in the south-east of South Australia.
The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Collet Barker, an early explorer of the region at the mouth of the Murray River. It has always been based in the south-eastern rural areas of South Australia, centred on Bordertown and Mount Gambier, but in recent years its boundaries have been extended to the north to include Riverland towns such as Renmark. Barker is the only one of South Australia's remaining original six divisions that has never been held by the Australian Labor Party.  It has been in the hands of the Liberal Party and its predecessors for its entire existence, except for a six-year period when Country Party MP Archie Cameron held it; however, Cameron joined the United Australia Party, direct forerunner of the Liberals, in 1940.  
Barker originally extended as far west as the outer fringes of the Adelaide area, around Glenelg. However, that portion was removed after parliament was expanded in the 1949 redistribution, making this already safely conservative seat even more so. Its most prominent members have been Cameron, a former leader of the Country Party and later Speaker of the House in the Menzies Government, Jim Forbes, a minister in the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments, and Ian McLachlan, Minister for Defence from 1996 to 1998 in the Howard Government.

[[History of Northumberland]]
CATEGORIES: History of England by county, History of Northumberland

Northumberland, England's northernmost county, is a land where Roman occupiers once guarded a walled frontier, Anglian invaders fought with Celtic natives, and Norman lords built castles to suppress rebellion and defend a contested border with Scotland. The present-day county is a vestige of an independent Northern English kingdom that once stretched from Edinburgh to the Humber. Reflecting its tumultuous past, Northumberland has more castles than any other county,Long, B. (1967). Castles of Northumberland. Newcastle, UK: Harold Hill. and the greatest number of recognised battle sites. Once an economically important region that supplied much of the coal that powered the industrial revolution, Northumberland is now a primarily rural county with a small and gradually shrinking population.Dowson, J.

[[Servitor]]

CATEGORIES: History of education

In certain universities (including some colleges of University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh), a servitor was an undergraduate student who received free accommodation (and some free meals), and was exempted from paying fees for lectures.  The term is still used in New College, School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh where it refers to the staff who are responsible for patrolling, security, reception and are also on duty at formal occasions when their functions include carrying the mace and ushering.
At Oxford, servitors were originally expected to act as servants to the fellows of their college. By 1852 this requirement had largely fallen into disuse, and the term had been replaced (often by Clerk or Bible-clerk) at most colleges. The last recorded use of the term in Oxford was in 1867 (at Christ Church; the following year the same people were called Exhibitioners).servitor The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989.

José Craveirinha (28 May 1922 - 6 February 2003), was born in Maputo, Mozambique (then Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique) and is today considered the greatest poet of that country.
The child of a Portuguese father and a black mother of the Ronga ethnicity, Craveirinha was raised in the language and culture of Portugal. His poems, written in Portuguese, address such issues as racism and the Portuguese colonial domination of Mozambique. He was one of the African pioneers of the Négritude movement.
As a journalist, Craveirinha contributed to numerous Mozambican magazines and newspapers, including O Brado Africano, Notícias, Tribuna, Notícias da Tarde, Voz de Moçambique, Notícias da Beira, Diário de Moçambique, and Voz Africana. He also played football and coached other athletes.  He arranged an athletic scholarship in the United States for Maria de Lurdes Mutola, who won a gold medal in track and field at the Olympics in 2000, and his son Stelio also held the national long jump record.
Craveirinha also wrote under the pseudonyms Mário Vieira, José Cravo, Jesuíno Cravo, J. Cravo, J.C., and Abílio Cossa. He was imprisoned in solitary confinement by the fascist Portuguese PIDE régime from 1965 to 1969 for his membership in a cell of FRELIMO, the leading movement for the liberation of Mozambique from Portuguese rule. When FRELIMO seized power in 1974, Craveirinha was freed from prison and appointed vice-director of the national press.
Craveirinha was awarded the Prémio Camões, the world's highest honour for lusophone literature, in 1991. He was considered several times for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
In 2003, Craveirinha was declared a "national hero" by President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who praised Craveirinha's literary contribution to the fight against colonialism.

[[Bunny hop (cycling)]]

CATEGORIES: Cycling

The bunny hop or  bunnyhop, is a bicycle trick that allows the rider to launch their bike into the air as if jumping off a ramp. The pedals on the bicycle seem to stick to the rider's feet as the bike becomes airborne very much like the way the skateboard seems to stick to the feet of the skater performing an Ollie. While the bunny hop can be quite challenging to learn, once mastered it opens up a whole new level of riding opportunities for both BMX and mountain bike rider alike.
The bunny hop is also a useful skill for an urban cyclist/commuter, allowing the avoidance of potholes and other hazards, and allowing for quick mounting of curbs.
More often, bunny hops are done on BMX bikes, which are smaller than mountain bikes and because they are more light-weight lend themselves to be lifted far more easily.
Other terms for bunnyhop have been around for years and include the J-hop, bronco, Californian, hop-walk, and others.  Local areas have been coming up with their own name for the bunnyhop for decades.  The characteristic of the bunnyhop where the front wheel is lifted first, then the back wheel is lifted is the technique which these terms are supposed to convey.  Another method to do a bunnyhop is to lift both wheels at the same time instead of front wheel then back wheel. There are undoubtedly many other terms for the bunnyhop used in different locales, but bunnyhop is still the most widely used term for the technique.

[[History of Oxfordshire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Oxfordshire, History of England by county, Oxfordshire

The county of Oxfordshire was formed in the early years of the 10th century and is broadly situated in the land between the River Thames to the south, the Cotswolds to the west, the Chilterns to the east and the Midlands to the north, with spurs running south to Henley-on-Thames and north to Banbury.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
Historically the area has always had some importance, containing valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country and the prestigious university in the county town of Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon Oxenaford = "ford for oxen"). Ignored by the Romans, it was not until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the 8th century that the area grew in importance. Alfred the Great was born across the Thames in Wantage in Berkshire. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, though its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The importance of agriculture as an employer has declined rapidly in the 20th century though; currently under one percent of the county's population are involved due to high mechanisation.
Throughout most of its history the county was divided into fourteen hundreds, namely Bampton, Banbury, Binfield, Bloxham, Bullingdon, Chadlington, Dorchester, Ewelme, Langtree, Lewknor, Pyrton, Ploughley, Thame and Wootton.
The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the main army unit in the area, was based at the Barracks on Bullingdon Green, Cowley.
The Vale of the White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire in 1974. Conversely, the Caversham area of Reading now belongs to Berkshire but was historically part of Oxfordshire as was the parish of Stokenchurch, now in administrative Buckinghamshire.

The National Union of Ship's Stewards, Cooks, Butchers and Bakers was the principal trade union for service personnel serving aboard British merchant ships between 1909 and 1921.
It was formed in Liverpool in 1909 by Joe Cotter, a former Cunard steward. Over the years which followed it developed a strong following in the liner ports of Southampton, Glasgow, London, Bristol and Hull. In 1911 the union supported the seamen's strikes which broke out in all major British ports.
In 1921, the National Maritime Board imposed wage reductions for marine workers with the support and assistance of the principal seamen's union, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union. The National Union of Ship's Stewards refused to endorse this move and instead supported attempts to resist the reductions. Much weakened by these efforts, the Stewards' Union amalgamated at the end of 1921 with the British Seafarers' Union to form the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union.

[[History of the Great War]]
CATEGORIES: Series of non-fiction books, Series of history books about World War I, United Kingdom in World War I

The History of the Great War is a series of 29 volumes covering the military operations of the British Army during the First World War.  The full title is the History of the Great War Based on Official Documents but the series is usually referred to as the British Official History.  It was produced by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence under the control of the Official Historian Brigadier-General Sir James Edmonds.  The first volume was published in 1923 and the final volume was published in 1949.
The History of the Great War was written as a technical history for military staff, rather than as a popular history for consumption by the general public.  British historian John Keegan, critical of the dry, featureless prose, said "the compilers... have achieved the remarkable feat of writing an exhaustive account of one of the world's greatest tragedies without the display of any emotion at all.". In 1996 Paddy Griffith called it an encyclopaedic work, transparently individualistic in tone, lucidly organised, wide in scope and by far the best book on the Western Front.[tpl]#tag:ref|Griffith called the quantity of writing on the Great War "prodigious" and that despite the eventual Official Historian, J. E. Edmonds being unstable, insecure and never having held a field appointment during the war, Edmonds was also concientious, intelligent and rarely allowed his devious and opinionated nature to distort his comments in the Official History.[tpl]sfn|Griffith|1996|pp=258–259[/tpl]|group="Note"[/tpl]

The List of Australian Football League pre-season and night series premiers is a complete chronological listing of the winners of the Victorian Football League (VFL) and Australian Football League (AFL) pre-season and night series competitions. 
From 1956 to 1971, the night series was a consolation knock-out competition held in September at the Lake Oval in Albert Park amongst the eight teams who failed to reach the finals in the VFL premiership season, apart from 1957, when all twelve teams competed.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Kevin|title=Inside Football Footystats|publisher=ACP Action|location=Oakleigh, Victoria|year=2000|isbn=0-646-37926-7|page=76[/tpl]  
There were no official VFL night series held during the 1972 to 1976 seasons, however in 1976 the National Football League (the national governing body at the time) held their own night series mid-week during the season, known as the NFL Wills Cup.  In 1977, the VFL revived their own night series, also held mid-week during the season and televised on Channel 7 to rival the NFL series that was shown on Channel 10.[tpl]cite book|editor=Ross, John|title=100 years of Australian football|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Ringwood, Victoria|year=1997|isbn=0-14-026969-X|page=277[/tpl]  Whilst the 1977 series only featured the twelve VFL teams, between 1978 and 1986 a selection of teams from the SANFL, WAFL and representative teams from Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania also competed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/night_series_grand_finals.htm#13%20in%201978|title=VFL & AFL Night Series & Pre-season Grand Finals|last=Devaney|first=John|accessdate=12 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514094301/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/night_series_grand_finals.htm|archivedate=14 May 2011[/tpl]
With the national expansion of the VFL to include teams from Western Australia and Queensland the 1987 series was restricted to only the 14 VFL teams and commenced during the pre-season period, but was completed mid-week between rounds 5 and 6 of the 1987 VFL season.[tpl]cite book|author=Poat, Peter & East, Alan|title=Football Register|publisher=Westralian Publishers|location=Applecross, Western Australia|year=1987|edition=25th Edition|pages=103, 117[/tpl]

[[History of Staffordshire]]
CATEGORIES: Staffordshire, Local government in Staffordshire, History of Staffordshire, History of England by county

The historic county of Staffordshire included Wolverhampton, Walsall, and West Bromwich, these three being removed in 1974 to the new county of West Midlands.   The resulting administrative area of Staffordshire has a narrow southwards protrusion that runs west of West Midlands to the border of Worcestershire.  Further, the city of Stoke-on-Trent was removed in the 1990s to form a unitary authority, but is still considered part of Staffordshire for ceremonial purposes.
The historic county had an area of 781,000 acres (1,250 sq. miles) and at the first census in 1801 had a population of 239,153.History Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire, by William White, pub. Sheffield, 1834
The county probably first came into being in this form in the decade after the year 913; that being the date at which Stafford - the strategic military fording-point for an army to cross the Trent - became a secure fortified stronghold & the new capital of Mercia under Queen Æthelflæd.
Historically, Staffordshire was divided into the five hundreds. The origin of the hundred dates from the division of his kingdom by King Alfred the Great into counties, hundreds and tithings. From the beginning, Staffordshire was divided into the hundreds of Totmonslow, Pirehill, Offlow, Cuttleston and Seisdon.A topographical history of Staffordshire, by William Pitt, pub J. Smith (Newcastle -under-Lyme), 1817; page 13  
The hundredal division of Staffordshire differs markedly from that of the counties to the south and west in showing far greater stability. All the Domesday hundreds are kept practically unchanged down to modern times. Also in the size of the hundreds. The Staffordshire hundreds, five in number, are on the whole far larger than any in the adjacent counties; more especially as regards northern Staffordshire. The two hundreds in the south-west are of more normal extent. It seems to be due chiefly to the nature of the county. Northern Staffordshire is to a large extent moorland, which must have been unattractive to early settlers. It is noteworthy, as showing where the centres of these hundreds lay, that the meeting-places of the two northern hundreds (Pirehill and Totmonslow) are in the extreme south of the respective hundreds. Southern Staffordshire was largely a forest-district. The southern part of Seisdon hundred was covered by Kinver Forest, and large parts of the two hundreds in the central part of the county, those of Cuttleston and Offlow, must have been occupied by Cannock Forest. The cultivated areas of these hundreds must in early days have been considerably smaller than at present.The English Hundred Names, by Olof Anderson, Lund (Sweden), 1934. Page 144
The County symbol, the Staffordshire Knot, is seen on an Anglian stone cross that dates from around the year 805.  The cross still stands in Stoke churchyard.  Thus the Knot is either i) an ancient Mercian symbol or ii) a symbol adopted from the Celtic Christianity, Christianity having been brought to Staffordshire by Lindisfarne monks from the year 650.

[[History of Warwickshire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Warwickshire, History of England by county

This is about the history of the county Warwickshire situated in the English Midlands. Historically, bounded to the north-west by  Staffordshire, by Leicestershire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the east, Worcestershire to the west, Oxfordshire to the south and Gloucestershire to the south-west.  Areas historically part of Warwickshire include Coventry, Solihull, Sutton Coldfield and a small area of central Birmingham including Aston and Edgbaston. These became part of the metropolitan county of West Midlands (Sutton Coldfield becoming part of Birmingham) following local government re-organisation in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.HMSO.  Local Government Act 1972.  1972 c.70
Much of northwestern Warwickshire, including that area now forming part of Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham, was covered by the ancient Forest of Arden which was still the case at the time of the Domesday Book but much of which was later cut down to provide fuel for industrialisation. Thus the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with either the Old English "ley" or "leah" meaning a clearing in a forestWiktionary or latterly the phrase "-in-Arden", such as Henley-in-Arden, Hampton-in-Arden and Tanworth-in-Arden. Even at the time of the Domeday Book the forested area has been calculated to be a quarter of the whole county or half of the northern area, the "Arden".The Forest Of Arden, William George Fretton, Editor, published in The Old Cross, 1878 The remaining southern area, not part of the forest, was called the Felden - from fielden.Historic Warwickshire, Its Legendary Lore Traditional Stories and Romantic Episodes, J Tom Burgess, 1876 Historically, two towns dominate the county, Warwick, the county town and Coventry an important medieval city.

[[Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom, Maritime trade unions, Water transport in the United Kingdom, 1922 establishments in the United Kingdom

The Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union was a trade union of sailors, firemen and ship-board service personnel which existed in the United Kingdom between 1922 and 1926.
It was a merger of the British Seafarers' Union and the National Union of Ship's Stewards, both of which were opposed to the principal trade union in the shipping industry, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union.
At the outset, the AMWU expressed an ambition to replace the NSFU and ultimately to become part of the recently established Transport and General Workers Union. But a number of factors limited the union's effectiveness. It faced resistance from both the NSFU and the Shipping Federation, which collaborated through the National Maritime Board to control access to employment in the shipping industry. The AMWU also suffered from severe internal divisions.
In 1923 and 1925, the AMWU once again found itself unsuccessfully resisting wage reductions. In the latter instance, its effectiveness was limited by the refusal of its general secretary (Joe Cotter) to sign cheques, and the consequent impossibility of accessing union funds. The union also lost ground at this time to the Seamen's Section of the National Minority Movement (formed 1924), which attracted many of those seafarers who were most determined to resist the reductions. The Minority Movement, which was sponsored by the Communist Party and included black activist seafarers in this xenophobic period, was suspicious of the AMWU. Such activists regarded the AMWU as a sectional organisation.
In 1926, a former member of the National Union of Ship's Stewards launched a legal challenge to the union's status, alleging that the ballot which brought about the merger of the two organisations had not been properly conducted. The AMWU lost this challenge and, as a result, was unable to access its funds. Despite the efforts of its National Organiser, Manny Shinwell, the AMWU was wound up in early 1927.

Sussex [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|s|ɨ|k|s[/tpl], from the Old English 'Sūþsēaxe' ('South Saxons'), is a historic county  in the south east of England. The foundation of the Kingdom of Sussex is recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year AD 477, saying that Ælle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons and killed or put to flight the local inhabitants.
The foundation story is regarded as somewhat of a myth by most historians, although the archaeology suggests that Saxons did start to settle in the area in the late 5th century.ASC Parker MS. 477AD.Welch. Anglo-Saxon England p. 9. The Kingdom of Sussex became the county of Sussex; then after the coming of Christianity; the see originally founded in Selsey, was moved to Chichester in the 11th century. The See of Chichester was coterminous with the county borders.Diocese of Chichester Website In the 12th century the see was split into two archdeaconries centred at Chichester and Lewes.Diane Greenway. The Medieval Cathedral in Hobbs. Chichester Cathedral. pp. 14–15
After the Reform Act of 1832 Sussex was divided into the eastern division and the western division, these divisions were coterminous with the two archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes. In 1889, following the Local Government Act 1988, using those same boundaries, Sussex was divided into two administrative counties, East Sussex and West Sussex together with four self-governing county boroughs, Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and Worthing. On 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county boundaries were revised with the mid-Sussex area of East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and Hassocks being transferred from East Sussex into West Sussex along with Crawley and the Gatwick area that was formerly part of Surrey. The county boroughs were returned to the control of the two county councils but in 1997 the towns of Brighton and Hove were amalgamated as a unitary local authority and in 2000, Brighton and Hove was given City status. There continue to be a range of organisations that still operate within the ancient borders of Sussex although it is now the two counties of East and West Sussex, such as the Diocese of Chichester, Sussex Police, the Sussex Archaeological Society the Sussex History Society and the Sussex Wild Life Trust Association. In 2010 the Sussex Association was established as a branch of the Association of British Counties, which is a society dedicated to promoting awareness of the continuing importance of the 86 historic (or traditional) Counties of Great Britain.
Although the name Sussex is derived from the Saxon period between AD 477 to 1066, the history of human habitation in Sussex goes back to the Old Stone (Paleolithic) Age.Armstrong. A History of Sussex. Chapter 2. The first Inhabitants Sussex has been occupied since those times and although it has been an industrious county it has succumbed to various persecutions, wars, invasions, political unrest and migrations throughout its long history.

[[History of Worcestershire]]

CATEGORIES: History of Worcestershire, History of England by county

Worcestershire was the heartland of the early English kingdom of the Hwicce, one of the peoples of Anglo-Saxon England. The exact boundaries of their kingdom are uncertain, though it is likely that they coincided with those of the old Diocese of Worcester, founded in 679–80,  of which the early  bishops bore the title Episcopus Hwicciorum. The kingdom would therefore have included Worcestershire except for its northwestern tip.Hooke, Della (1985) The Kingdom of the Hwicce , pp.12-13
Absorbed by the Kingdom of Mercia during  the 7th  century and then by the unified Kingdom of England from 927 to 1707, it was a separate ealdormanship briefly in the 10th century before forming part of the Earldom of Mercia in the 11th century. In the years leading up to the Norman conquest in 1066, the Church, including the cathedral, Evesham Abbey, Pershore Abbey, Malvern Priory and other religious houses, increasingly dominated county.  The last known Anglo-Saxon sheriff of the county was Cyneweard of Laughern, and the first Norman sheriff was Urse d'Abetot who built the castle of Worcester and seized much church land. Worcestershire was the site of the Battle of Evesham in which Simon de Montfort was killed on  4 August 1265.
In 1642 the first major skirmish of the Civil War,  the Battle of Powick Bridge, on the River Teme close to Worcester, occurred when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert, a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war, defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John BrownTrevor Royle References pp 171-188 Worcestershire was again the focus of the Civil War when it was effectively ended by Cromwell's victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651
During  the Middle Ages, much of the county's economy was based on the wool trade, and many areas of its dense forests, such as Malvern Chase, were royal hunting grounds. In the nineteenth century, Worcester was a centre for the manufacture of gloves; the town of Kidderminster became a centre for carpet manufacture, and Redditch specialised in the manufacture of needles, springs and hooks. Droitwich Spa, being situated on large deposits of salt, was a centre of salt production from Roman times, with one of the principal Roman roads running through the town. These old industries have since declined, to be replaced by other, more varied light industry. The county is also home to the world's oldest continually published newspaper, the Berrow's Journal, established in 1690. Malvern was one of the centres of the 19th  century  rise in  English spa towns due to Malvern water being  believed to be very pure, containing "nothing at all".
Bottled Waters of the World. Retrieved 9 August 2009
In 1974 the county was merged with Herefordshire to form a large single administrative county of Hereford and Worcester which  in  1998  was reverted to the original  historical  counties.  Some changes in  borders occurred with some areas such as Halesowen, Stourbridge, and the exclave of Dudley, which used to be part of northern Worcestershire becoming part of West Midlands metropolitan county.  Yardley had already been made part of Birmingham in the county of Warwickshire.  The post-1998 county therefore does not correspond exactly to the pre-1974 boundaries.

Olea [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|l|iː|ə[/tpl]Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 is a genus of about 40 species in the family Oleaceae, native to warm temperate and tropical regions of southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australasia. They are evergreen trees and shrubs, with small, opposite, entire leaves. The fruit is a drupe. Leaves of Olea contain Tricho sclereids.
For humans, the most important species is by far the Olive (Olea europaea), native to the Mediterranean region. O. paniculata is a larger tree, attaining a height of 15–18 m in the forests of Queensland, and yielding a hard and tough timber. The yet harder wood of the Black Ironwood O. laurifolia, an inhabitant of Natal, is important in South Africa.
Olea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Double-striped Pug.

Mattias Öhlund (born September 9, 1976) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman and an alternate captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to joining the Lightning, he played eleven seasons with the Vancouver Canucks. Öhlund played two seasons in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the second highest tier of hockey in Sweden, with Piteå HC before being selected by the Canucks thirteenth overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft; he then joined Luleå HF of the Elitserien, the highest league in Sweden, winning the Le Mat Trophy as league champions in 1996. He began his NHL career with Vancouver in 1997–98, the start of an eleven-year tenure with the club. A serious eye injury before his third NHL season was the first of many injuries Öhlund has sustained over his career, and he has only played a full season twice in eleven years. A four-time winner of the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team's best defenceman, Öhlund is the Canucks' all-time leading goal and point-scorer among defencemen.
Internationally, Öhlund has represented Sweden in numerous tournaments, beginning with three World Junior Championships that included Best Defenceman honours as part of a silver medal effort in 1996. He has since competed in three World Championships, earning gold in 1998, and three Winter Olympics, earning gold in 2006.

[[Time deposit]]

CATEGORIES: Banking, Interest-bearing instruments

A time deposit (also known as a certificate of deposit in the United States, a term deposit, particularly in Canada, Australia and New Zealand; a bond in the United Kingdom; Fixed Deposits in India and in some other countries) is a money deposit at a banking institution that cannot be withdrawn for a certain "term" or period of time (unless a penalty is paid)[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]. When the term is over it can be withdrawn or it can be held for another term. Generally speaking, the longer the term the better the yield on the money.  In its strict sense, certificate deposit is different from that of time deposit in terms of its negotiability: CDs are negotiable and can be rediscounted when the holder needs some liquidity, while time deposits must be kept until maturity.
The opposite, sometimes known as a sight deposit or "on call" deposit, can be withdrawn at any time, without any notice or penalty: e.g., money deposited in a checking account in a bank.
The rate of return is higher than for savings accounts because the requirement that the deposit be held for a prespecified term gives the bank the ability to invest it in a higher-gain financial product class. However, the return on a time deposit is generally lower than the long-term average of that of investments in riskier products like stocks or bonds.
A time deposit is an interest-bearing bank deposit that has a specified date of maturity. A deposit of funds in a savings institution is made under an agreement stipulating that (a) the funds must be kept on deposit for a stated period of time, or (b) the institution may require a minimum period of notification before a withdrawal is made.
"Small" time deposits are defined in the U.S. as those under $100,000, while "large" ones are $100,000 or greater in size. The term "jumbo CD" is commonly used in the United States to refer to large time deposits.
In the U.S., banks are not subject to a reserve requirement against their time deposit holdings.

O is a 2001 American drama film, and a loose modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello.
The film's intended release date was April 1999, but due to the Columbine High School massacre, the film was shelved for two years by its original distributor, Miramax Films. Ultimately, it was sold along with director Kevin Smith's film Dogma to Lionsgate. It was directed by Tim Blake Nelson and written by Brad Kaaya. It contains many different styles of music, ranging from rap to opera. It was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina.
Told in a contemporary high school setting, Othello is now Odin James ('OJ') (Mekhi Phifer), star of the basketball team and the school's only African American student. Desdemona is Desi (Julia Stiles), the dean's daughter and Odin's girlfriend. Iago is Hugo (Josh Hartnett), the coach's steroid-addicted son, who plants seeds of doubt that fester in Odin's mind, leading them all to a violent fate. Roderigo is Roger (Elden Henson), a rich but troubled student who wants to go out with Desi, and like many others in the film, is easily manipulated by the cunning Hugo. Cassio is Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan), another basketball player and a close friend to both Odin and Desi. Emilia is Emily (Rain Phoenix), Desi's best friend and Hugo's girlfriend. Brabantio is Dean Brable (John Heard), the president of the school and Desi's father. The duke of Venice is the basketball coach, also known as Duke (Martin Sheen).

[[Hyperbolic angle]]
CATEGORIES: Angle, Differential calculus, Integral calculus

In mathematics, a hyperbolic angle is a geometric figure that divides a hyperbola. The science of hyperbolic angle parallels the relation of an ordinary angle to a circle. The hyperbolic angle is first defined for a "standard position", and subsequently as a measure of an interval on a branch of a hyperbola.
A hyperbolic angle in standard position is the angle at (0, 0) between the ray to (1, 1) and the ray to (x, 1/x) where  x > 1.
The magnitude of the hyperbolic angle is the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector which is ln x.
Note that unlike circular angle, hyperbolic angle is unbounded, as is the function ln x, a fact related to the unbounded nature of the harmonic series.
The hyperbolic angle in standard position is considered to be negative when 0 Suppose ab = 1 and cd = 1 with c > a > 1 so that (a, b) and (c, d) determine an interval on the hyperbola xy = 1. Then the squeeze mapping with diagonal elements b and a maps this interval to the standard position hyperbolic angle that runs from (1, 1) to (bc, ad). By the result of Gregoire de Saint-Vincent, the hyperbolic sector determined by (a, b) and (c, d) has the same area as this standard position angle, and the magnitude of the hyperbolic angle is taken to be this area.
The hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh use the hyperbolic angle as their independent variable because their values may be premised on analogies to circular trigonometric functions when the hyperbolic angle defines a hyperbolic triangle.
Thus this parameter becomes one of the most useful in the calculus of a real variable.

The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet is a novella by Stephen King first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1984 and collected in King's 1985 collection Skeleton Crew.  The title is in reference to the narrator's belief that insanity is a sort of "flexible bullet" – it will eventually kill you, but how long this process takes, and how much damage the bullet does before the victim finally dies, are impossible to predict.  Since the publication of this story, King has occasionally used the term "flexible bullet" to describe insanity, in reference to this story.

Joseph A. Day (born January 24, 1945) is a Canadian politician. He has been a Canadian Senator since October 4, 2001.
Day studied at College Militaire Royal Saint-Jean in 1963. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1968. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1963 to 1968. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada.
Day entered politics in 1978, when a by-election was held in his native New Brunswick. Day returned from his practice of law in Ottawa, Ontario to contest the by-election as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada, but was defeated in what had long been a Progressive Conservative stronghold.
He faced the same electorate three times in two years due to the rapid succession of general elections that came in May 1979 and February 1980.
In 1982, he ran for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, but was narrowly defeated on the final ballot by Doug Young. The leadership race was very divisive, and the Liberals went down to their worst defeat in recent history in the 1982 provincial election.  Day, who sought election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in a Saint John riding, was defeated in his fifth contest in five years.
Day's wife, Georgie Day, was elected to the legislature, on her first attempt in electoral politics, in 1991, and was re-elected in 1995. While in the legislature, she served in the cabinets of Premiers Frank McKenna, Ray Frenette, and Camille Thériault.
Day was appointed to the Senate of Canada from New Brunswick in 2001. He has been active on issues of Veterans Affairs Canada and media concentration. He will be a Senator until 2020 should he fill his full term.
On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Day, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators-from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.[tpl]cite news|title=Trudeau’s expulsion catches Liberal senators by surprise|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-to-boot-senators-from-liberal-caucus-in-bid-to-restore-senate-independence/article16567413/|accessdate=January 29, 2014|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 29, 2014[/tpl]

[[Squeeze mapping]]
CATEGORIES: Affine geometry, Functions and mappings, Linear algebra, Articles containing proofs

In linear algebra, a squeeze mapping is a type of linear map that preserves Euclidean area of regions in the Cartesian plane, but is not a Euclidean motion.
For a fixed positive real number r, the mapping
is the squeeze mapping with parameter r. Since
is a hyperbola, if u = rx and v = y/r, then uv = xy and the points of the image of the squeeze mapping are on the same hyperbola as (x,y) is. For this reason it is natural to think of the squeeze mapping as a hyperbolic rotation, as did Émile Borel in 1913, by analogy with circular rotations which preserve circles.

[[1986 Formula One season]]
CATEGORIES: Formula One seasons, 1986 in Formula One

The 1986 Formula One season was the 37th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1986 Formula 1 World Championship which commenced on 23 March and ended on 26 October after sixteen races. The Formula 1 World Championship for Drivers was won by Alain Prost 1986 Formula 1 World Championship for Drivers (points table), 1987 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 86 and the Formula 1 World Championship for Manufacturers was awarded to Williams.1986 Formula 1 World Championship for Manufacturers (points table), 1987 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 87
The championship culminated in a points battle between the Williams duo of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell versus McLaren's Alain Prost at the final race, the 1986 Australian Grand Prix. Mansell's tyre blew in spectacular fashion and Piquet, in the lead at the time of the incident, was brought in for an unscheduled pit stop soon afterward by Williams to prevent the same happening to his tyres. This enabled Prost to take the lead and the race victory (his fourth of the season) and to secure his second consecutive drivers championship.ESPN coverage of the 1997 Japanese Grand Prix, end-of-year F1 championship battles segment narrated by Bob Varsha
For the first time, turbocharged engines were compulsory due to a ban on naturally aspirated (atmospheric) engines. The law banning atmospheric engines was rescinded in [tpl]F1|1987[/tpl], in preparation for a ban on all forced induction engines for [tpl]F1|1989[/tpl]. For 2014 turbocharged engines are now the norm effectively ending naturally aspirated (atmospheric) engines.
The Formula One cars of 1986 are the most powerful F1 cars to ever have raced. There were still no limits on engine power, and some engines, including the powerful but rather unreliable BMW M12/13 1.5 litre single turbocharged straight-4 engine used by the Benetton, Brabham and Arrows teams, could throw out 1,350+ hp at 5.5 bar boost (79.7 psi) during qualifying; this would happen when the engineers took the boost restrictors off the engine- then the power of the turbocharged engines was so great that it could not even be accurately measured until years later, when the technology was advanced enough. Purpose-built drivetrains had to be fitted to the chassis of each car for specific sessions- there were qualifying engines (as described above) nicknamed "grenades" that had unrestricted boost pressure, and qualifying gearboxes, ones that were designed to withstand the engine's immense power; these components would only last about 3-4 minutes (2-3 laps) during use. These drivetrain units were then taken out and then replaced with the boost-restricted engines and specifically prepared gearboxes for races (if too much power was used, the engines would be so worn that they would simply explode due to extreme stress, hence the nickname "grenade"). When these turbocharged engines were fitted to the cars, the whole package weighed about 540 kg (1,190 lb)- so the power-to-weight ratios were extreme. For qualifying, the power to weight ratios were about 2,500 hp/ton+ for the Benetton-BMW and 1,850 hp/ton for the Benetton's race trim; compared to about 1,175 hp/ton for a modern F1 car- and all Formula 1 cars had manual stick-shift gearboxes then. To put that in perspective, a modern family car produces about 80-100 hp/ton and the fastest modern road-going cars produce about 450-550 hp/ton. But a consistent problem for these new turbo engines that was somewhat smoothed over (particularly by Ford and Honda) over the years was the terrible turbo lag; engines were mechanically turbocharged in those days. The power would only come on all at once 2-3 seconds after the driver put his foot down; it would usually measure out from 100-300 hp for the first 2-3 seconds then the engine would go immediately to the top of the power range (usually 900-1000hp). The black and white nature of these engines made them very difficult to drive; drivers had to anticipate when the power would come on, so they would floor the gas pedal much earlier than usual to get the power on at the right moment. 
The boost of the engines would often be restricted to the point where they would only be producing around 900–1,000 hp during the race. The Honda twin-turbocharged V6 exclusively supplied to the Williams team were second to BMW in overall power and had slightly less power than the German engines, and the Ferrari, TAG/Porsche, and Renault twin-turbocharged V6 engines were not as powerful and as efficient as the Honda and BMW engines and produced about 25-40 less horsepower than the Japanese and German powerplants. The new Ford-Cosworth turbocharged V6 (a successor to the ubiquitous DFV V8) was made in a rush and was therefore underpowered and underdeveloped; it apparently had 150-200 less horsepower than the front-running European and Honda engines; but continued development meant that this engine got considerably better in 1987. And finally, the underfunded and very unreliable Alfa Romeo and Motori Moderni engines were considerably less powerful than any of the others and kept their users down the order frequently. The power difference in engines from 1980 to 1986 was huge- the power of engines over those 6 years doubled. In 1980, the most powerful engine was the Renault twin-turbo V6 engine, which produced between 550-600 horsepower; most teams were using naturally-aspirated Ford-Cosworth DFV V8 engines in 1980 that produced about 480-510 hp.
At many races, particularly at high speed circuits such as Imola, Spa-Francorchamps, Hockenheim, the Österreichring and Monza, fuel consumption was always a concern, as the FIA lessened the amount of allowable fuel from 220 litres in [tpl]F1|1984[/tpl] and [tpl]F1|1985[/tpl] to 195 litres for 1986. As a result, fuel consumption became a problem for most teams since the engines were slightly more powerful than before. There were many races where a number of drivers ran out of fuel, most notably Alain Prost at Hockenheim, who very nearly finished third but ran out of fuel less than a quarter of a mile from the finishing line. He got out and desperately tried to push his stricken car across the finish line, ultimately never making it and finishing sixth. The Honda engines (second in power to the BMW engines) had the edge on fuel consumption and reliability, but the TAG/Porsche, Renault and BMW engineers were able to gain some ground later in the season.
Drivers who retired from F1 racing at the end of 1986 were Patrick Tambay, as well as [tpl]F1|1980[/tpl] World Champion Alan Jones and [tpl]F1|1982[/tpl] champion Keke Rosberg, while injuries suffered at the British Grand Prix forced the retirement of Jacques Laffite. Those who never drove in an F1 race again after 1986 were Johnny Dumfries, Huub Rothengatter and Allen Berg, while Marc Surer suffered a serious rally crash following his ninth place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix which forced his retirement from driving altogether. Elio de Angelis was killed in a testing accident at the Circuit Paul Ricard after the Monaco Grand Prix; he remained the last driver to die in an F1 crash until Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.
The 1986 Formula One calendar featured two new events in the Hungarian Grand Prix, as well as the Mexican Grand Prix, the latter of which returned to the calendar after a sixteen-year absence. Two races exiting the calendar were the Dutch Grand Prix after 33 years, and the South African Grand Prix after 21 years.

Rosberg was the first driver since Mike Hawthorn in the 1958 season to win the championship with only one race win. 11 drivers won a race during the season, none of them more than two times, including nine different winners in nine consecutive races.[tpl]cite web|title=If you include the final two races of last season, the last seven GPs have had seven different winners – is this a record? |url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/79610.html|work=Ask Steven - ESPNF1.com|accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] 
The combination of technical and sporting regulations used during this season prompted many complaints about safety before and during the season. The season saw two fatalities and many serious and violent accidents. Ferrari driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed in an accident during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder after hitting the March car of Jochen Mass. Italian driver Riccardo Paletti died at the Canadian Grand Prix when his Osella car hit the back of Didier Pironi's stalled car at the start of the race. Pironi, who had been Villeneuve's teammate, suffered massive injuries to his legs in another qualifying accident at the German Grand Prix and never raced in Formula One again.
The season started with a drivers' strike at the first race of the season. Later in the season, the disagreement between the sport's governing body and the teams (known as the FISA–FOCA war) restarted and many of the teams boycotted the San Marino Grand Prix. For the first time since the inception of Formula One more than 30 years earlier, there were no non-Championship races run during 1982. This situation would become permanent from [tpl]F1|1984[/tpl] onward. It was also the only season to host three Grands Prix in the same country (United States): the Caesars Palace Grand Prix, Detroit Grand Prix and United States Grand Prix West.
The 1982 season was the end of an era, in which, since 1950, at least 1 or 2 drivers were killed every year in a Formula One related event. From 1983 onwards, the sport would see 3 more drivers die in Formula One cars: Elio de Angelis in 1986 driving a Brabham during testing at Paul Ricard, Roland Ratzenberger in 1994 during practice for the San Marino Grand Prix, and triple world champion Ayrton Senna during the race itself, barely a day after Ratzenberger's death.

Voigtländer ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈfoːktlɛndɐ[/tpl]) is an optical company founded by Johann Christoph Voigtländer in Vienna in 1756 and is thus the oldest name in cameras. It produced the Petzval photographic lens (the fastest lens at that time: f/3.7) in 1840, and the world's first all-metal daguerrotype camera (Ganzmetallkamera) in 1841, also bringing out plate cameras shortly afterwards. It set up a branch office in Braunschweig in 1849, moving its headquarters there later. The company issued stock in 1898, and a majority of the shares were acquired by Schering in 1925.
Over the next three decades, Voigtländer became a technology leader and the first manufacturer to introduce several new kinds of product that later became commonplace. These include the first zoom lens for 35mm still photography (36–82/2.8 Zoomar) in 1960 and the first 35mm compact camera with built-in electronic flash (Vitrona) in 1965.
Schering sold its share of the company to the Carl Zeiss Foundation in 1956, and Zeiss and Voigtländer integrated in 1965. In 1972 Zeiss/Voigtländer stopped producing cameras, and a year later Zeiss sold Voigtländer brand to Rollei. On the collapse of Rollei in 1982, Plusfoto took over the name, selling it in 1997 to Ringfoto.
Since 1999, Voigtländer-branded products have been manufactured and marketed by Cosina; for these, see Cosina Voigtländer.

The season also included two non-championship races for Formula One cars.
In an extraordinarily political season the World Championship went to McLaren driver James Hunt by one point from Ferrari's defending champion Niki Lauda, although Ferrari took the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers. Hunt had moved from the Hesketh team to McLaren, taking the place of dual World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi who had moved to drive for his brother Wilson's Fittipaldi Automotive team for the season.
The controversy began in Spain where Hunt was initially disqualified from first place, giving the race to Lauda, only for the decision to be overturned on appeal months later. The six-wheeled Tyrrell P34 confounded the skeptics by winning in Sweden, with Lauda third and Hunt fifth.
Hunt won in France and, it seemed, in Britain, but the race had been restarted after a first lap pile-up and Hunt drove on an access road returning to the pits, which was against the rules. He was eventually disqualified after an appeal from Ferrari. Lauda became the official race winner.
Lauda then crashed heavily in West Germany and appeared likely to die from his injuries. Hunt won the race and finished fourth to John Watson's Penske (the team's only win) in Austria. Miraculously, Lauda returned to finish fourth in Italy, where Hunt, Jochen Mass and Watson were relegated to the back of the grid for infringements of the regulations.
Hunt won in Canada and in the US but Lauda took third to lead Hunt by three points going into the final race in Japan. In appalling weather conditions Mario Andretti won, Lauda gave up because of the hazardous conditions, and Hunt eventually finished third to take the title.
Chris Amon, drove his last grand prix in Germany, failing to win a single championship race. The 1976  Wolf-Williams cars were originally  Heskeths, and Williams had left the team by September.

The season also included three non-championship Formula One races and a nine race South African Formula One Championship.
After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the Brabham team were favourites to win the 1975 title. The year started well, with an emotional first win for Carlos Pace at the Interlagos circuit in his native São Paulo. However, over the season tyre wear frequently slowed the cars, and the initial promise was not maintained.Gill, Barrie (1976) "The World Championship 1975" John Player Motorsport yearbook 1976 p. 103 Queen Anne Press Ltd.

Niki Lauda often refers to 1975 as "the unbelievable year". In his second year with Ferrari, the team provided him with the Ferrari 312T—a car that was technically far superior to any of the competition.

Emerson Fittipaldi and Clay Regazzoni went into the last race of the World Championship level on points, but Regazzoni dropped down the field with handling problems, so Fittipaldi's fourth place gave him the championship. Fittipaldi, Ronnie Peterson and Carlos Reutemann each won three races, Jody Scheckter and Niki Lauda two each, Regazzoni and Denny Hulme, who retired at the end of the season, one each. Graham Hill ran a new team of Lolas, the larger-than-life Hesketh team entered its own car after running James Hunt in a March, and Americans Roger Penske and Parnelli Jones entered their own cars late in the season. Chris Amon's own car, like the Token and the Trojan, was not a success. Two F1 drivers died over the course of the season, Peter Revson in a practice session accident at the South African GP in March, then Austrian newcomer Helmuth Koinigg at the US GP in October.

After the death of Jochen Rindt the previous year, Lotus had a desultory season, with young and inexperienced drivers such as Emerson Fittipaldi appearing in the cars. The team spent a lot of time experimenting with a gas turbine powered car, and with four wheel drive again. Using their own chassis heavily inspired by the Matra MS80 but with conventional tanks, Tyrrell and Jackie Stewart easily took success in 1971. Of the 11 races in the season, Mario Andretti, Jacky Ickx, Jo Siffert, Peter Gethin and François Cevert won one race each, while Stewart won the other 6 races.
Jo Siffert and Pedro Rodríguez, who had an intense rivalry driving for John Wyer's Gulf-sponsored works Porsche endurance sportscar team both lost their lives racing in 1971. Rodriguez died driving a Ferrari 512 at an Interserie race at the Nosiring, Germany in July; and Siffert died in a fiery crash at the World Championship Victory Race non-championship Formula One event at Brands Hatch in October.
The Belgian Grand Prix was originally supposed to be held on 6 June (between the Monaco and Dutch Grands Prix), at the notorious 8.7 mile (14.1 km) Spa-Francorchamps circuit, but the failure of the track owners and authorities to bring Spa up to mandatory safety specs meant that the circuit was deemed unsuitable for Formula One cars to race on and the event was promptly cancelled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr201.html |title=Dutch GP, 1971 Race Report - GP Encyclopedia - F1 History on |publisher=Grandprix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]

[[Federal funds]]

CATEGORIES: Federal Reserve, Interest rates, Economics terminology

[tpl]Refimprove|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]main|Federal Reserve System[/tpl]
In the United States, federal funds are overnight borrowings between banks and other entities to maintain their bank reserves at the Federal Reserve. Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with reserve deficiencies. These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, "overnight".  The interest rate at which these deals are done is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like eurodollars, they are an unsecured interbank loan.Discount Window vs. Fed Funds 
Federal funds transactions by regulated financial institutions neither increase nor decrease total bank reserves. Instead, they redistribute reserves and enable otherwise idle funds to yield a return.  Banks may borrow these funds to avoid an overdraft (that is, the balance going below reserve requirement) of their reserve account, or in order to meet the reserves required to back their deposits.  Federal funds are definitive money, meaning that they are available for immediate spending, while checks and many other forms of money must be cleared by banks and typically take several days before becoming available for spending.
Participants in the federal funds market include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, government-sponsored enterprises, branches of foreign banks in the United States, federal agencies, and securities firms. Many relatively small institutions that accumulate reserves in excess of their requirements lend reserves overnight to money center and large regional banks, as well as to foreign banks operating in the United States. Federal agencies also lend idle funds in the federal funds market.

William Hemsley (January 23, 1737 – June 5, 1812) was an American planter and political leader from Maryland. He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783.
Hemsley’s entire life was closely connected with his family’s plantation, Clover Fields Farm, in Queen Anne's County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. The family had been established there and in Talbot County for several generations. His career of public service was similar to that of many prominent planters. He was a county official in both counties at various times, and served as a Colonel in the militia of Queen Anne’s County during the Revolutionary War.
Hemsley was first elected to the Maryland state senate in November 1779. He would serve in that body until 1781. Then in 1782-1783 he served in the Continental Congress in New York. He was again elected to the state senate in 1784, but declined that election. He would serve again from 1786 to 1789. Although re-elected again in 1790, he did not serve. He was a member of the Maryland Convention that ratified the United States Constitution on April 28, 1788.
His later years were spent running the family plantation. He died there on June 5, 1812 and was buried in the family’s cemetery on the farm, near Queenstown, Maryland. His son, William Hemsley, Jr., also served in the state senate in 1799–1800.

CATEGORIES: Electrolyte disturbances, Intoxication, Body water, Substance intoxication

Water intoxication, also known as water poisoning or dilutional hyponatremia, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside safe limits by over-hydration. 
Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water drinking contests in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or long bouts of intensive exercise during which electrolytes are not properly replenished, yet huge amounts of fluid are still consumed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Noakes TD, Wilson G, Gray DA, Lambert MI, Dennis SC |title=Peak rates of diuresis in healthy humans during oral fluid overload |journal=S.

Water, just like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-consumed in a specific period of time. Water intoxication mostly occurs when water is being consumed in a high quantity without giving the body the proper nutrients it needs to be healthy.http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html
Excess of body water may also be a result of a medical condition or improper treatment; see "hyponatremia" for some examples.

[[Nikasil]]

CATEGORIES: Engine technology, Nickel alloys

Nikasil is a trademarked electrodeposited lipophilic nickel matrix silicon carbide coating for engine components, mainly piston engine cylinder liners.
Nikasil was introduced by Mahle in 1967, initially developed to allow rotary engine apex seals (NSU Ro 80 and Mercedes C111) to work directly against the aluminum housing. This coating allowed aluminum cylinders and pistons to work directly against each other with low wear and friction. Unlike other methods, including cast iron cylinder liners, Nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances and thus allowed existing engine designs to be expanded easily. The aluminium cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity than cast iron liners, an important attribute for a high-output engine. The coating was further developed by US Chrome Corporation in the United States in the early 1990s (under the trade name of "Nicom"), as a replacement for hard-chrome plated cylinder bores for Mercury Marine Racing, Kohler Engines, and as a repair replacement for factory-chromed snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATVs, watercraft and automotive V8 liners/bores.
Porsche started using this on the 1970 917 race car, and later on the 1973 911 RS. Porsche also used it on production cars, but for a short time switched to Alusil due to cost savings for their base 911. Nikasil cylinders were always used for the 911 Turbo and RS models. Nikasil coated aluminum cylinders allowed Porsche to build air-cooled engines that had the highest specific output of any engine of their time. Nikasil is still used in today's 911s.
Nikasil was very popular in the 1990s. It was used by companies such as Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Jaguar Cars and Moto Guzzi in their new engine families. However, the sulfur found in much of the world's low-quality gasoline caused some Nikasil cylinders to break down over time, causing costly engine failures.The Jaguar AJ-V8 Engine
Nikasil or similar coatings under other trademarks are also still widely used in racing engines, including those used in Formula One and ChampCar. Suzuki currently uses a race-proven nickel phosphorus-silicon-carbide proprietary coating trademarked SCEM (Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material) to maximize cylinder size and improve heat dissipation, e.g., on the engine of the Suzuki TL1000S, V-Strom 650, TU250X and Hayabusa motorcycles.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/suzuki/suzuki-vstrom-650-17909.html | title= Suzuki V-Strom 650, Sean Alexander, Mar. 21, 2004| work= www.motorcycle.com[/tpl]
Nikasil is short for Nickel Silicon Carbide. Silicon carbide is a very hard ceramic (much harder than steel) that can be dissolved in nickel. The nickel solution can then be electroplated onto the aluminum cylinder bore. The piston rings will then rub off the exposed nickel, leaving a very hard layer of silicon carbide to protect the aluminum piston from direct contact with the aluminum cylinder. With this setup, the engine tolerances can be much tighter for better performance. The cylinder must be re-plated after it is re-bored, but Nikasil is extremely durable, so the cylinder does not need to be reworked as often as an iron or chrome cylinder.[tpl]cite web | url= http://rdupowersports.com/nikasil-cylinder-de-glazing/ | title= Nikasil Cylinder De-Glazing| work= http://rdupowersports.com[/tpl]

[[Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network]]

CATEGORIES: Wireless network organizations

The Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN) is a special project of the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (UCIMC).  Started in 2000 by a group of developers wishing to take advantage of under-utilized Internet links purchased for public use (such as those in municipal offices, schools, and universities), it began a partnership with UCIMC in 2004, gaining its current special project status.  CUWiN inherits UCIMC's not-for-profit status and is devoted to building a network architecture to cost-effectively and efficiently create a community wireless network.
The project has built a communications network using wireless networking equipment ranging from commodity personal computers to specialized Soekris miniaturized, fan-less computers with integrated networking.  This is essentially the same "WiFi" equipment used in homes and offices, but CUWiN put it on rooftops to connect neighbors and form a high-speed community network.  It is one of many localized community wireless network projects across the world and is developing a platform which can be reused by certain types of these projects, based on their community's geographic structure.

William Nelson Page  (January 6, 1854 – March 7, 1932) was an American civil engineer and industrialist. He was active in the Virginias following the U.S. Civil War. Page was widely known as a metallurgical expert by other industry leaders and investors as well as state and federal authorities.
William Page became one of the leading managers and developers of West Virginia's rich bituminous coalfields in the late-19th and early-20th century, as well as being deeply involved in building the railroads and other infrastructure necessary to process and transport the mined coal.  Page often worked as a manager for absentee owners, such as the British geological expert, Dr. David T. Ansted, and the New York City mayor, Abram S. Hewitt of the Cooper-Hewitt organization and other New York and Boston financiers, or as the “front man” in projects involving a silent partner, such as Henry H. Rogers. In the town of Ansted, for 28 years, the Page family lived in a large Victorian mansion built by carpenters of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company.
Most notable among Page's many accomplishments was a project to acquire land and construct a modest short-line railroad to tap new coal reserves in a rugged portion of southern West Virginia not yet reached by the bigger railroads. Connections planned to both the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W) should have inspired competition among rival carriers to transport the coal the rest of the way to market. However, collusion by the leaders of the large railroads attempted to stop the project through agreeing to only offer Page unprofitable rates. Instead of giving up, working with Rogers discreetly providing the millions needed for financing, William Page and his associates expanded the "short line" all the way hundred of miles across the Virginias to a new coal pier built on Hampton Roads, creating the Virginian Railway. Completed in 1909, the VGN was built to be very efficient and during the first half of the 20th century, became widely known as the "Richest Little Railroad in the World."
William and Emma completed their lives in Washington D.C., where they moved in 1917 as he served as a mining expert before federal regulators. One of their younger sons, Randolph Gilliam "Dizzy" Page, was an early pioneer of the U.S. air mail industry during this time before his death in plane crash in 1930. William and Emma died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, and were interred in Richmond, Virginia's Hollywood Cemetery.

Splenic flexure syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe bloating, muscle spasms of the colon, and upper abdominal discomfort thought to be caused by trapped gas at the splenic (as opposed to hepatic) flexure in the colon; the pain caused can be excruciating and debilitating, and may mimic that of a heart attack (because of the proximity of the splenic flexure to the diaphragm and referred pain from irritation to the diaphragmatic sensory nerves).
Some physicians classify splenic flexure syndrome as a type of IBS; others consider it a separate condition.

The Suffolk Resolves was a declaration made on September 9, 1774 by the leaders of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, of which Boston is the major city.  The declaration rejected the Massachusetts Government Act and resolved on a boycott of imported goods from Britain unless the Intolerable Acts were repealed.  The Resolves were recognized by statesman Edmund Burke as a major development in colonial animosity leading to adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence from Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776, and he urged British conciliation with the American colonies, to little effect. The First Continental Congress endorsed the Resolves on September 17, 1774.[tpl]cite book|author=John K.

[[Greening Australia]]
CATEGORIES: Environmental organisations based in Australia, Conservation in Australia, 1982 establishments in Australia, Organizations established in 1982

Greening Australia is an Australian environmental organisation, founded in 1982, the International Year of the Tree, to protect, restore and conserve Australia's native vegetation. Greening Australia was formed by the United Nations Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia.
In the 1980s tree cover decline was acknowledged as having a serious adverse impact on agricultural and pastoral productivity. Removal of tree cover was also linked with the development of salinity, soil degradation and erosion, and declining water quality. On World Environment Day in 1982, then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced the establishment of the National Tree Program, which aimed to reverse tree decline throughout Australia. Greening Australia provided the non-government arm of the National Tree Program. With representation in every state and territory and a national office in Canberra, Greening Australia became the primary focus for non-government tree projects.
Since its inception, Greening Australia has undergone a natural evolution over the years - from a tree planting-centric organisation to a landscape-focused one. The Gondwana Link and River Recovery projects reflect this change and the need to address the impacts of climate change.
Greening Australia has been involved in many large scale revegetation and restoration projects in Australia since its inception, including the National Tree Program, the One Billion Trees Project, Bushcare Support, National Corrdiors of Green, Florabank and Green Corps. The focus of its work lies in providing trees and tree planting services, technical advice and education, volunteer coordination and funding for restoration projects.
On World Environment Day 1998, Greening Australia's work was recognised with admission to the United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Roll of Honour. This award recognises outstanding achievements in protection of the environment, and represents a significant achievement for Australia's role in world conservation.

[[Texas's 4th congressional district]]

CATEGORIES: Congressional districts of Texas

Texas District 4 of the United States House of Representatives is a Congressional district that serves an area that includes some counties along the Red River north of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, including semi-rural Rockwall County and the large non-urbanized portion of Collin County. It also includes counties in East Texas such as Rains County. As of the 2000 census, District 4 represents 651,620 people who are predominantly Caucasian (80.8%) and middle-class (median family income is US$46,086, compared to $50,046 nationwide).   
Texas has had at least four congressional districts since the state was readmitted to the Union after the Civil War.  The district's current seat dates from 1903; only four men have represented it since then. 
Once a reliably Democratic district, the district swung rapidly into the Republican column as Dallas' suburbs spilled into the western portion of the district. In fact, it has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964.  For many years, it was based in Tyler, but a controversial 2003 redistricting orchestrated by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay drew it and neighboring Longview out of District 4 and into neighboring District 1 which made District 1 significantly more Republican.
Ralph Hall, the current dean of the Texas congressional delegation, has represented the district since 1981.  Originally a Democrat, he became a Republican in 2004.  Congressman Ralph Hall has been a fence rider for many years, voting in large part with the Democratic party, and as needed with the Republican Party when his vote did not matter. He had been rumored as a party switcher for some time, and many experts believed his district was almost certain to be taken over by a Republican anyway once he retired. In 1996 a conservative Republican candidate Jerry Ray Hall, ran against Congressman Ralph Hall, and to the surprise of conservative Republicans, Senator Phil Gramm endorsed Congressman Ralph Hall,a Democrat at the time.    The Republican Senator campaigned with the Democratic Congressman throughout the district. This enraged the Republican Women's groups. The Women Republican's demanded Senator Phil Gramm's retirement because of his endorsement of a Democrat against Jerry Ray Hall the Republican nominee. Wendy Gramm was involved in the Enron Scandal which also contributed to Senator Phil Gramm's demise.  Before and after his party switch, Congressman Hall has proven to be in the middle of the road.
The district's best-known congressman was Sam Rayburn, the longtime Speaker of the House.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in the fourth district.
Even as late as 1996, Bill Clinton carried 10 of the 16 counties currently in this district.

Artur Carlos Maurício Pestana dos Santos (born 1941) is a major Angolan writer of fiction. He writes under the name Pepetela.
A white Angolan, Pepetela was born in Benguela, Portuguese Angola, and fought as a member of the MPLA in the long guerrilla war for Angola's independence. Much of his writing deals with Angola's political history in the 20th century. Mayombe, for example, is a novel that portrays the lives of a group of  MPLA guerrillas who are involved in the anti-colonial struggle in Cabinda, Yaka follows the lives of members of a white settler family in the coastal town of Benguela, and A Geração da Utopia reveals the disillusionment of young Angolans during the post-independence period. Pepetela has also written about Angola's earlier history in A Gloriosa Família and Lueji, and has expanded into satire with his series of Jaime Bunda novels. His most recent works include Predadores, a scathing critique of Angola's ruling classes, O Quase Fim do Mundo, a post-apocalyptic allegory, and O Planalto e a Estepe, a look at Angola's history and connections with other former communist nations. Pepetela won the Camões Prize, the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1997. Pepetela is a Kimbundu word that means "eyelash," translation of his surname, "pestana" in Portuguese. The author received this nom de guerre during his time as an MPLA combatant.

The season officially began on June 15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55 people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. In the span of two weeks, hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes.[tpl]#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (179 km/h), or a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2010-07-11|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628222802/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]|group="nb"[/tpl] The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history.

The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November 15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December 30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January 6 of the following year.

It was first sighted on a flight on December 20, 1928 by Sir Hubert Wilkins. Thinking it was part of the mainland of Antarctica, he named it Hearst Land, for William Randolph Hearst who helped finance the expedition. It was resighted and its insularity ascertained in 1940 by members of the USAS who explored this coast by land and from the air. They named it Wilkins Island. Examination of aerial photographs have shown, however, that this large island is what Wilkins considered Hearst Land.

In pragmatics, the origo is the reference point on which deictic relationships are based. In most deictic systems, the origo identifies with the current speaker (or some property thereof). For instance, if the speaker, John, were to say "This is now my fish", then John would be the origo, and the deictic word "my" would be dependent on that fact. Likewise, his use of the word "this" and "now" communicate his properties, namely his location and point in time. 
The word origo comes from Latin origo (pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ɒ|ˈ|r|iː|g|ɒ[/tpl]), which means "origin" (pl. origines, [tpl]IPAc-en|ɒ|ˈ|r|iː|g|ɪ|n|ɛ|s[/tpl]). Origo is also the root for the English word "origin".
This word also occurs in the term phrase fons et origo, meaning "source and origin" (fons, "source", et, "and", "even").

The Merlion (Malay: Singa-Laut) is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, used as a mascot and national personification of Singapore. Its name combines "mer" meaning the sea and "lion". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means "sea town" in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name — Singapura — meaning "lion city" or "kota singa".
The symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium, for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in use from 26 March 1964 to 1997"A new home for the Merlion". URA Skyline (July/August 2000). p. 6–8 and has been its trademarked symbol since 20 July 1966. Although the STB changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol.Singapore Tourism Board: "Use of the Merlion Symbol"  Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion appears frequently on STB-approved souvenirs.
The merlion— a mythical creature with the body of a fish and the head of a lion— occurs in a number of different artistic traditions. Lions with fishtails can be found on Indian murals at Ajanta and Mathura, and on Etruscan coins of the Hellenistic period. Merlions, or ‘heraldic sea-lions’, are an established element of Western heraldry, and have been used on the coat of arms of the cities of Portsmouth and Great Yarmouth in the United Kingdom; the City of Manila; and the East India Company.

Professor Anthony John Clark MA MSc PhD OBE FRSE (18 September 1951 – 12 August 2004), Director of the Roslin Institute from 2002-2004.
English molecular biologist who was a founder of applying molecular technology to farm animals. His PhD was on Satellite DNA at the Medical Research Council Unit, in Edinburgh. From there he joined John Bishop’s team at the Institute of Genetics, at Edinburgh University, where he carried out research into the genes in the liver of mice. In 1985 he was appointed to the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (subsequently the Roslin Institute) where he began work in genetic modification to produce a sheep giving milk with human proteins. He was successful within five years. Tracy, born in 1990, was the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein, making 35g of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (used in treatment of cystic fibrosis) in each litre of her milk. During the 1990s, Clark continued to develop transgenic techniques on large animals. With his colleagues, he produced a sheep from which a prion protein gene had been removed, the first time this had been achieved in a large animal. Clark's work set the stage for Ian Wilmut's team at Roslin to clone a sheep, Dolly (1996), the result of transplanted DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilized egg cell.

[[Molly Bloom]]

CATEGORIES: Ulysses (novel) characters, Fictional characters introduced in 1918, Fictional Irish people, Fictional Jews, Characters in novels of the 20th century, Monologues

Molly Bloom is a fictional character in the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. The wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not. Molly is having an affair with Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan after ten years of her celibacy within the marriage (though some critics, including Gilbert, point out that the celibacy of Penelope is questionable). Molly, whose given name is Marion, was born in Gibraltar in 1870, the daughter of Major Tweedy, an Irish military officer, and Lunita Laredo, a Gibraltarian of Spanish Jewish descent. Molly and Leopold were married in 1888. She is the mother of Milly Bloom, who, at the age of 15, has left home to study photography. She is also the mother of Rudy Bloom, who died at the age of 11 days. In Dublin, Molly is an opera singer of some renown.    
The final chapter of Ulysses, often called "Molly Bloom's Soliloquy", is a long and unpunctuated stream of consciousness passage comprising her thoughts as she lies in bed next to Bloom.

The 1985 World Series began on October 19, 1985 and ended October 27. The American League champion Kansas City Royals played against the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, winning the series four games to three.  The Series was popularly known as the "Show-Me Series", or the "I-70 Showdown Series," as both cities are in Missouri, connected by Interstate 70.
The Cardinals won the National League East division by three games over the New York Mets, then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, four games to two, in the National League Championship Series.  The Royals won the American League West division by one game over the California Angels then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, four games to three, in the American League Championship Series.
The Cardinals were seeking to win their NL-leading tenth World Series title, while the Royals were seeking to become the first AL expansion team to win the World Series.  The Royals were completing what remains the most successful decade by any expansion team, with 6 division titles and 2 pennants from 1976 to 1985, though they have not reached the postseason since.
This was the first World Series in which all games were played at night. This was also the first World Series that featured television commentator Tim McCarver, who called the games for ABC with Al Michaels and Jim Palmer. Howard Cosell was originally supposed to be in the booth, but he was removed from his assignment just prior to Game 1 because of the controversy surrounding his book I Never Played the Game.[tpl]cite news |title=Less of Howard Cosell Marked a New Era in TV Sports |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nWVTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-oUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5732,40543&dq=howard+cosell+1985+world+series&hl=en |volume=15 |number=1 |page=8 |newspaper=Daily News |publisher=Kingsport, Inc. |date=January 2, 1986 |accessdate=July 30, 2012 [/tpl]

Kadamba ([tpl]lang-kn|ಕದಂಬರು[/tpl]) (345 – 525 CE) was an ancient royal dynasty of Karnataka, India that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present day Uttara Kannada district. At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, the Kadambas of Banavasi ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state.
The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharman in 345 CE which at times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma, a powerful ruler with whom even the kings of Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital alliances. Tiring of the endless battles and bloodshed, one of the later descendants, King Shivakoti adopted Jainism. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into Goa and Hanagal.
During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled Karnataka, the Mauryas, Satavahanas and Chutus were not natives of the region and the nucleus of power resided outside present day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil at an administrative level. In the history of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad based historical starting point in the study of the development of region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language. Their legacy is so impressive that even the Vijayanagars who fought Islamic kings and raiders, hired Kadamba descendants to manage their Goa military naval fleet.P. 48 Goa Today, Volume 17 By Goa Publications, 1982 - Goa, Daman and Diu (India)

[[Ensoniq MR61]]
CATEGORIES: Ensoniq synthesizers, Music workstations

The Ensoniq MR61 is a 61-key music workstation synthesizer that Ensoniq released in 1996. It features a 16-track sequencer, digital effects, and several hundred onboard sounds or patches.
This music workstation got rid of some previous classical Ensoniq features, such as polyphonic aftertouch (replacing it by a mono version) and full sound editability. Its concept of usage was also radically different from previous Ensoniq keyboards, such as the TS-10. The machine's operating system was created with numerous operational and MIDI bugs, however, an updated OS chip that resolved these issues was created and is still available from 3rd party vendors. Notable, most of those problems were compensated by an improved 64-note polyphony, high quality 24-bit effects and a quick (but not fully editable) sequencer. The addition of the Idea Pad, which was essentially a MIDI capture buffer, allowed the user to quickly move anything recently played on the MIDI keyboard, including Pitchbend, Mod, and MIDI realtime Controllers, to a track in the sequencer.
While the direct sample loading facilities of the previous TS/ASR models were lost, a rare add-on card, called the MR-Flash, allowed the MR/ZR keyboards to load up to 4 mebibytes of samples into permanent flash ROM, via floppy disk drive. However, no sample library import facilities were offered, so existing ASR/TS owners couldn't use their sample files on the new machine. A drum machine with pro-quality mixable preset patterns, benefitted from the unusually large internal drumsounds library (approx. 700 samples) and was integrated with the sequencer, but it was impossible to create patterns inside the machine.  Instead, a program that allowed a user to create drum patterns on PC was developed, thus allowing the user to create numerous rhythms that could be loaded onto disk and work within the fluid drum machine and all aspects of the keyboard.
The effects section runs at full 44.1 kHz quality, unlike the TS engine at 32 kHz. The routing scheme was also simplified from previous machines and sports similarities with Roland's XP machines.
All MR versions could house up to three expansion cards, each one holding up to 24 mebibytes of samples and sound data. That was a first (and last) for Ensoniq products. Three are known: Perfect Piano, Urban Dance Project and World Sounds.  Each cost about $250.  A fourth card, the Drums Expansion, could give the rack version a feature that was a standard part of the keyboard versions.  It was a 2 mebibyte add-on and contained about 700 drum sounds.  A fifth card was the aforementioned flash expansion.
The MR76 was the 76-note weighted keyboard version. The MR-Rack (which actually appeared before the keyboard versions) shared the same architecture and sounds, with the obvious exception of the sequencer and drum machine.  Also, while the rack version could take the same wave expansion cards of the keyboard counterparts, it was not compatible with the flash ROM sample-loading add-on.
You can hear some Ensoniq MR-Sounds on the Janet Jackson Song Together Again and her album The Velvet Rope from 1997.

The Incredible Hulk is an American television series based on the Marvel Comics character, the Hulk. The series aired on the CBS television network and starred Bill Bixby as David Banner, Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk, and Jack Colvin as Jack McGee.
In the TV series, Dr. David Banner, a widowed physician and scientist, who is presumed dead, travels across America under assumed names (his false surnames always begin with the letter "B", but he keeps his first name), and finds himself in positions where he helps others in need despite his terrible secret: in times of extreme anger, he transforms into a huge, incredibly strong green creature, who has been given the name "The Hulk”.  In his travels, Banner earns money by working temporary jobs while searching for a way to control his condition.
The series was originally broadcast by CBS from 1978 to 1982, with 82 episodes over five seasons. The two-hour pilot movie, which established the Hulk's origins, aired on November 4, 1977. It was developed and produced by Kenneth Johnson, who also wrote or directed some episodes.
After the series ended, the fate of David Banner was a cliffhanger until 1988. The franchise was purchased from CBS by rival NBC. They produced three made-for-television films: The Incredible Hulk Returns (directed by Nicholas Corea), The Trial of the Incredible Hulk and The Death of the Incredible Hulk (both directed by Bill Bixby).'The Incredible Hulk' Bring Me the Head of the Hulk (TV episode 1981) IMDb Since its debut, The Incredible Hulk series has garnered a worldwide fan base.[tpl]cite news|title= Hulk Smash Television! |publisher= IGN |url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/881/881149p1.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010[/tpl]

[[Baroque pearl]]
CATEGORIES: Jewellery components, Pearls

Baroque pearls are pearls with an irregular non-spherical shape. Shapes can range from minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinch, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical nucleation bead.
The most valuable of baroque pearls are the South Sea and Tahitian pearls.  These pearls are produced by Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped oysters) and Pinctada maxima (gold-lipped and white-lipped oysters).  Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl.  Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters. Tahiti is the number one cultivator of Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

[[Pulmonary agent]]

CATEGORIES: Pulmonary agents

A pulmonary agent (or choking agent) is a chemical weapon agent designed to impede a victim's ability to breathe. They operate by causing a build-up of fluids in the lungs which then leads to
suffocation. Exposure to the eyes and skin tend to be corrosive, causing blurred vision and severe deep burns. Inhalation of these agents cause burning of the throat, coughing, vomiting, headache, pain in chest, tightness in chest, and respiratory and circulatory failure.
Examples of pulmonary agents include:
Phosgene is the most dangerous commonly used pulmonary agent (although disulfur decafluoride and perfluoroisobutene are both even more dangerous, with respectively 4 and 10 times the lethality of phosgene, neither is widely used). It is a colorless gas under ordinary conditions. It has a vapor density 3.4 times greater than that of air, allowing it to remain low in the air for long periods of times. Phosgene leads to massive pulmonary edema, which reaches maximum symptoms in 12 hours after exposure, followed by death within 24–48 hours.
Chlorine is an element used in industry. It is one of the most commonly manufactured chemicals in the United States. It is used to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents. It is also used in drinking water and swimming pools to kill bacteria. The extent of poisoning caused by chlorine depends on the amount of chlorine a person is exposed to.

Tremella fuciformis is a species of fungus; it produces white, frond-like, gelatinous basidiocarps (fruiting bodies). It is widespread, especially in the tropics, where it can be found on the dead branches of broadleaf trees. This fungus is commercially cultivated and is one of the most popular fungi in the cuisine and medicine of China.[tpl]cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Stamets|title=Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms = oyobi yakuyo kinoko no sabai|edition=3rd|year=2000|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, California, USA|isbn=978-1-58008-175-7|pages=402–406|chapter=Chapter 21: Growth Parameters for Gourmet and Medicinal Mushroom Species[/tpl] Tremella fuciformis is commonly known as snow fungus, silver ear fungus, and white jelly mushroom.
Tremella fuciformis is a parasitic yeast, and grows as a slimy, mucous-like film until it encounters its preferred hosts, various species of Annulohypoxylon (or possibly Hypoxylon) fungi, whereupon it then invades, triggering the aggressive mycelial growth required to form the fruiting bodies.

[[Postmodern Christianity]]
CATEGORIES: Christian theological movements, Christian philosophy, Types of existentialism, Postmodern theory, Postmodern religion, Religious existentialism

Postmodern Christianity are various forms of Christianity which have been influenced by postmodern philosophy. Although a relatively recent development within Christianity, some Christian postmodernists assert that their style of thought has an affinity with foundational Christian thinkers such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, and famed Christian mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Angelus Silesius. In addition to Christian theology, postmodern Christianity has its roots in post-Heideggerian continental philosophy, developed ca. 1960s to present. 
Despite the name some people eschew the label "postmodern Christianity" because the meaning of the term "postmodern" is frequently debated, even between those who use the label. Therefore some say it has almost no determinate meaning and, in the United States, serves largely to symbolize an emotionally charged battle of ideologies. Moreover, such alleged postmodern heavyweights as Jacques Derrida and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe have refused to operate under a so-called postmodern rubric, preferring instead to specifically embrace a single project stemming from the European Enlightenment and its precursors. Nevertheless, postmodern Christianity and its constituent schools of thought continue to be relevant.

Like most of the agents in the V-series (with the exception of VX), VM has not been extensively studied outside of military science. Little is known about this chemical compound other than its chemical formula.
It is commonly theorized that the so-called "second-generation" V series agents came from a cold war era Russian chemical weapons development program. They may have been developed sometime between 1950 and 1990. They have similar lethal dose levels to VX (between 10–50 mg) and have similar symptoms and method of action to other nerve agents that act on cholinesterase. The treatment remains the same, but the window for effectively treating second generation V series seizures is shorter. In addition to the standard seizures, some of the second generation V series agents are known to cause comas.

Jasmine tea ([tpl]Zh|c=茉莉花茶|p=mòlìhuā chá[/tpl]) is tea scented with aroma from jasmine blossoms to make a scented tea. Typically, jasmine tea has green tea as the tea base; however, white tea and black tea are also used. The resulting flavour of jasmine tea is subtly sweet and highly fragrant. It is the most famous scented tea in China.
The jasmine plant is believed to have been introduced into China from Persia via India during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), and was being used to scent tea around the fifth century. 
However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912) when tea started to be exported in large quantities to the West.
The jasmine plant is grown at high elevations in the mountains. Jasmine tea produced in the Chinese province of Fujian has the best reputation.Gong, Wen. Lifestyle in China. 五洲传播出版社, 2007.

Tetram is the common Russian name for the substance.  Amiton was the trade name for the substance when it was marketed as an insecticide by ICI in the mid-1950s. 
With a toxicity of about 1/10 that of VX, i.e. similar to that of sarin,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/cwco/download/table2_summary_schedules_relevance_cw_amended.pdf |accessdate=2006-10-07|title=Summary of CWC-Schedules and their Relevance to Chemical Warfare|work=Australia's National Authority for the Chemical Weapons Convention[/tpl] it is now considered too dangerous for use in agriculture[ref]

During the early 1950s at least three chemical companies working on organo-phosphorus insecticides independently discovered the amazing toxicity of these chemicals. In 1952, Dr. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist working for ICI at their Plant Protection Laboratories was investigating the potential of organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols for use as pesticides. Like the earlier German investigators of organophosphates in the late 1930s who had discovered the G-series nerve agents, Dr. Ghosh discovered that their action on cholinesterase made them effective pesticides. One of them, Amiton, was described in a 1955 paper by Ghosh and another chemist, J. F. Newman, as being particularly effective against mites. It was brought to market as an insecticide by the company in 1954 but was subsequently withdrawn as too toxic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbwinfo.com/Chemical/Nerve/nervgen.shtml|work=The site for information about chemical and biological weapons for emergency, safety and security personnel|title=Nerve Agents: General|accessdate=2006-10-07[/tpl] 
The toxicity of these substances had not passed unnoticed by the British Government, as some of the compounds had already been sent to their research facility at Porton Down for evaluation.  Some of the chemicals from this class of compounds formed a new group of nerve agents called V Agents. The British Government unilaterally renounced chemical and biological weapons in 1956, although in 1958 traded their research on VX technology with the United States Government in exchange for information on thermonuclear weapons. The US then went into production of large amounts of the chemically similar, but much more toxic VX in 1961.[tpl]cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061112085443/http://www.mitretek.org/AShortHistoryOfTheDevelopmentOfNerveGases.htm | accessdate=2006-10-07| title=A Short History of the Development of Nerve Gases | work=Mitrek Systems[/tpl]

DuBois was a carpenter from Poughkeepsie, New York. He enlisted in the Provincial Militia in 1762 at the age of 18.
On June 28, 1775, he was commissioned as a Captain and directed to form a Company from Dutchess County to became a part of Colonel James Clinton's 3rd New York Regiment in the Canadian Campaign. Within a year of his commission, on June 21, 1776, he was made a full Colonel and began raising the 5th New York Regiment. He was taken prisoner at Fort Montgomery October 6, 1777.
Colonel DuBois resigned his commission on December 22, 1779, but by 1780 he was commanding a regiment of New York Levies, fighting in the Mohawk Valley of New York. After the war, he was promoted to Brigadier General and became commander of the Dutchess County Militia.

The dish consists of various vegetables and other vegetarian ingredients (sometimes with the addition of seafood or eggs), which are cooked in soy sauce-based liquid with other seasonings until tender. The specific ingredients used vary greatly both inside and outside Asia.

Tridilosa is a very light and resistant, materials-efficient 3-D structure, made from steel and concrete and widely used in civil engineering. Tridilosa was invented by the Mexican engineer Heberto Castillo.
Among the most remarkable features of this structure is that it can save up to 66% on concrete usage and up to 40% on steel, because filling with concrete is not required in the tension zone, only in the superior compression zone. It is so light that it can float on water, but is three times stronger than traditional construction flagstone. It was used, for example, to construct the 54-floor World Trade Center of Mexico City.

[[Hamilton Beach, Queens]]
CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods in Queens

Hamilton Beach, one of the oldest sections of Howard Beach, is a middle class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. Its boundaries are the 102nd Street Creek to the north, the IND Rockaway Line ([tpl]NYCS Rockaway north[/tpl]) tracks and JFK Airport to the east, Hawtree Creek to the west, and Jamaica Bay to the south. Hamilton Beach is one of the few communities in New York City that has its own volunteer fire department. Hamilton Beach is frequently referred to as West Hamilton Beach. East Hamilton Beach was on the east side of the then Long Island Rail Road tracks, but was taken by the City for expansion of Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport) in the 1940s.
There was a Hamilton Beach station on the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch. The station closed on June 27, 1955 in connection with the LIRR's sale of much of the branch's right of way to the New York City Transit Authority.
Hamilton Beach is a small community that has one long strip (104th Street) with ten dead-end blocks connected to it. It is mostly surrounded by water. There is one way into Hamilton Beach by car and two ways in by foot. It is accessible by a boardwalk that stretches from the A train station at Coleman Square to 104th Street, or by the Hawtree Basin pedestrian bridge that is in between two of the ten blocks. This bridge connects Hamilton and Old Howard Beach. Hamilton has a small park at the southern end, with a 200-foot baseball field, a handball court, a small jungle gym area and beach. Gateways Hamilton Beach Park, just south of 165th Avenue, is the last stop for the Q11 bus, where the bus drivers take a quick break before returning to service.
Hamilton Beach was once an area with dirt roads, old shack-type houses (bungalows), and no sewer system, as the area was unincorporated. Recently Hamilton Beach has been "building up." There are new houses going up on almost every block.
Hamilton Beach bears no relation to the Hamilton Beach Company other than the name. The company is named after a Mr. Hamilton and a Mr. Beach.

[[Dirt cone]]

CATEGORIES: Glacial landforms

A dirt cone is a feature of a glacier or snow patch, in which dirt or debris has fallen onto ice, firn or snow. This debris forms a coating which, when thick enough, insulates the underlying ice or snow. Although deposition of sediments may be uniform originally, dirt cones can be produced due to the constant growing and shrinking of the underlying snow, which in turn masses the debris together. The surrounding ice or snow melts away, leaving the dirt cone.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wilson|first=J.

[[Whipple shield]]
CATEGORIES: Spacecraft components, Armour

The Whipple shield or Whipple bumper, invented by Fred Whipple,[tpl]Citation |last=Whipple |first=Fred L. | title=Meteorites and Space Travel | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=52 | pages=131 | year=1947 | doi=10.1086/106009|bibcode = 1947AJ.....52Q.131W [/tpl] is a type of hypervelocity impact shield used to protect manned and unmanned spacecraft from collisions with micrometeoroids and orbital debris whose velocities generally range between [tpl]convert|3|and|18|km/s[/tpl].
As opposed to monolithic shielding of early spacecraft, Whipple shields consist of a relatively thin outer bumper placed a certain distance off the wall of the spacecraft. This improves the shielding to mass ratio, critical for spaceflight components, but also increases the thickness of the spacecraft walls, which is not ideal for fitting spacecraft into launch vehicle fairings. The advantage of a bumper placed at a standoff over a single thick shield is that the bumper wall can shock the incoming particle and cause it to disintegrate. This spreads out the impulse particle over a larger area of the inner wall of the spacecraft.
There are several variations on the simple Whipple shield. Multi-shock shields,[tpl]Citation |last=Cour-Palais |first=Burton G. |coauthors=Crews, Jeanne L. | title=A Multi-Shock Concept for Spacecraft Shielding | journal=International Journal of Impact Engineering | volume=10 | issue=1-4 | pages=135–146 | year=1990 | doi=10.1016/0734-743X(90)90054-Y[/tpl][tpl]citation |inventor1-last=Crews |inventor1-first=Jeanne L. |inventor2-last=Cour-Palais |inventor2-first=Burton G. | title=Hypervelocity Impact Shield |issue-date=November 26, 1991 |patent-number=5067388 |country-code=US[/tpl] like the one used on the Stardust spacecraft, use multiple bumpers spaced apart to increase the shield's ability to protect the spacecraft.

CATEGORIES: Books about Australian history, Military history of Australia during World War I, History books about World War I

The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 is a 12-volume series covering Australian involvement in the First World War.  The series was edited by C.E.W. Bean, who also wrote six of the volumes, and was published between 1920 and 1942.  The first seven volumes deal with the Australian Imperial Force while other volumes deal with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force at Rabaul, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Flying Corps and the home front.  The final volume is a photographic record.
Unlike other official histories which are often aimed at military staff, Bean intended the Australian history to be accessible to a non-military audience.  The relatively small size of Australia's forces enabled the history to be presented in great detail, giving accounts of individual actions that would not have been possible when covering a larger force. For example, Bean dedicated over 100 pages to the Battle of Fromelles, a relatively small action intended as a diversion during the Battle of the Somme that lasted one night and involved a single Australian division (the 5th). However, Fromelles was also the first time that the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) saw action on the Western Front, and was very costly for the Australians, with 5,533 killed, wounded or captured.
Following the publication of the final volume, Charles Bean compiled Anzac to Amiens, a condensed history in a single volume aimed at the general public, which was published in 1946.

[[Sleepycat License]]

CATEGORIES: Free and open-source software licenses

Sleepycat License (sometimes referred to as Berkeley Database License or the Sleepycat Public License) is an OSI-approved open source license used by Oracle Corporation for the open-source editions of Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition and Berkeley DB XML embedded database products older than version 6.0.  (Starting with version 6.0 the open-source editions are instead licensed under the GNU AGPL v3.)  The name of this license is derived from the name of the company which commercially sold the Berkeley DB products, Sleepycat Software, which was acquired by Oracle in 2006.  Oracle continued to use the name "Sleepycat License" for Berkeley DB, despite not using the term "Sleepycat" in any other documentation until it changed to GNU AGPL with version 6.
According to the Free Software Foundation,Various Licenses and Comments about Them - Free Software Foundation it qualifies as a free software license, and is compatible with the GPL.
The license is a strong form of copyleft because it mandates that redistributions in any form not only include the source code of Berkeley DB, but also "any accompanying software that uses the DB software". It is possible to circumvent this strict licensing policy through the purchase of a commercial software license from Oracle Corporation consisting of terms and conditions which are negotiated at the time of sale. This is an example of dual licensing.
The effect of the dual license creates financial exposure for commercial organizations, since there is considerable risk of becoming liable for payment of license fees to Oracle.   Some people consider it to be a "sneaky" license. Mike Olson, co-founder and CEO of Sleepycat Software and Cloudera, said that "This is good business if you can get it, but your relationship with your customer begins based on a threat and that's not a really healthy place to start out."Mike Olson (co-founder and CEO of Sleepycat Software and Cloudera), lecture to Stanford University entrepreneurship students, 2013.11.13

BloggerCon was a user-focused conference for the blogger community that ran between 2003 and 2006. BloggerCon I (October 2003) and II (April 2004), were organized by Dave Winer and friends at Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for the Internet and Society in Cambridge, Mass. Bloggercon III took place in San Francisco on June 2006. According to the Online Journalism Review, "BloggerCon has lots of cooks, but the chief chef is technologist Dave Winer, co-founder of RSS and the patient zero of blogging. BloggerCon exists because Winer wants it to happen."
BloggerCon I was initially planned to be financed without corporate sponsors by charging $500 to attend. This plan sparked controversy. A second, free day was later added to the program.  For BloggerCon II and III, there was no registration cost; the conference was funded by voluntary contributions from attendees.
On the first, paid day of Bloggercon I, four panels discussed the interaction of blogging with journalism, education, marketing, and presidential politics. The second day's panels included various technical and infrastructure issues such as RSS, news aggregators, and what was then called "audioblogging". The first BloggerCon brought together audioblogging pioneers with developers, whose collective efforts led to the phenomenon that spread six months later under the name podcasting.
For BloggerCon II, the format was changed to create an unconference, with audience participation sessions, loosely moderated by a discussion leader, rather than formal panels or keynotes. One invited participant, Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, was unable to get a visa. He and others were still able to participate in the discussion via an IRC channel projected on a screen.
BloggerCon III met at Stanford Law School on November 6, 2004. Popular sessions included "Podcasting" with Adam Curry, "Overload" with Robert Scoble, and "Making Money" with Doc Searls. It was broadcast with help from ITConversations. Many also participated using IRC.
BloggerCon helped inspire the July 30, 2005 BlogHer conference. [tpl]Fact|date=May 2007[/tpl]

The South Eastern Railway (SER) was a railway company in south-eastern England from 1836 until 1922. The company was formed to construct a route from London to Dover. Branch lines were later opened to Tunbridge Wells, Hastings, Canterbury and other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, some older than itself, including the London and Greenwich Railway and the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Most of the company's routes were in Kent, eastern Sussex and the London suburbs, with a long cross-country route from [tpl]stnlnk|Redhill[/tpl] in Surrey to Reading, Berkshire.
Much of the company's early history saw attempts at expansion and feuding with its neighbours; the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in the west and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in 1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways, work them as a single system (marketed as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway) and pool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923.

[[Desert Lark]]

CATEGORIES: Ammomanes, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Asia, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of Western Sahara

The Desert Lark (Ammomanes deserti) breeds in deserts and semi-deserts from the Sahara east through the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East to Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
It is resident apart from local movements in arid stony areas, and avoids flat sand.  Its nest is on the ground in a rock crevice or amongst stones, with 3-4 eggs being laid. The food of the Desert Lark is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.
This is a small lark at 15 – 16.5 cm length. It is sand-coloured above and pale pinkish grey below, with a thick yellow-based bill. The tail is reddish brown with a diffuse dark terminal band.
The sexes are alike, but there is considerable geographical variation. For example,  A. d. payni of southern Morocco is greyer above than nominate deserti, and has orange flanks. A. d. annae of north Jordan has dark grey upperparts, head and breast.
The song is a mournful choo-wee-chacha wooee. Desert Lark is otherwise a quiet bird.

[[Artillery observer]]

CATEGORIES: Artillery speciality, Combat occupations

A military artillery observer or spotter is responsible for directing artillery and mortar fire, mostly at opportunity targets[tpl]cn|date=May 2012[/tpl], and may be a Forward Air Controller (FAC) for close air support and spotter for naval gunfire support.  Also known as "Forward Observer", "Fire Support Specialist", or "Fister". Most commonly observers accompany a tank or infantry manouvre unit.  More recently a mission controller for an Army Unmanned Air System (UAS) may also act as an artillery observer[tpl]cn|date=May 2012[/tpl] and some armies use special artillery patrols behind the enemy's forward elements.
Broadly, there are two very different approaches to artillery observation.  Either the observer has command authority and orders fire, including the type and amount of ammunition to be fired, to batteries. Or the observer requests fire from an artillery headquarters at some level, which decides if fire will be provided, by which batteries, and the type and amount of ammunition to be provided.  The first is characterised by the British, the second by the United States.  In World War II both Germany and the Soviet Union tended towards the British method.
Because artillery is an indirect fire weapon system, the guns are rarely in line-of-sight of their target, often located miles away.US Army, FM 3-09 The observer serves as the eyes of the guns, by sending target locations and if necessary corrections to the fall of shot, usually by radio. 
In the US System the observer sends a request for fire, usually to his battalion or battery Fire Direction Center (FDC).  The FDC then decides how much fire to permit and may request additional fire from a higher artillery headquarters.  FDC(s) convert the observer's target information into firing data for the battery's weapons. 
In the British system the observer sends a fire order to his own and any other batteries authorised to them, and may request fire from additional batteries.  Each battery command post converts the fire orders into firing data for its own guns.  Until post-World War II the observer would usually order actual firing data to the guns of his own troop, this was enabled by the use of calibrating sights on the guns[tpl]cn|date=May 2012[/tpl].
On land, artillery observers are considered high-priority targets by enemy forces[tpl]cn|date=May 2012[/tpl], as they control a great amount of firepower, are within visual range of the enemy, and may be located within enemy territory.

[[Dukes Highway]]

CATEGORIES: Highways in Australia

The Dukes Highway is an important 189 kilometre highway corridor in South Australia which links the Australian cities of Adelaide and Melbourne. It is part of the National Highway system spanning Australia, and is signed as National Highway A8. 
The Dukes Highway starts in Tailem Bend on the Princes Highway and extends southeast to the state border near Bordertown, South Australia. The highway continues in Victoria as the Western Highway, with the same route signage (National A8). The length of the highway on the South Australian side is around 191 km, joining onto the Western Highway which is 443 km.
Generally, the quality of the Dukes Highway is of a high standard, with the entire road having wide lane widths and sealed shoulder. The final 17 km of the highway after Bordertown, was originally built on unstable ground but was re-constructed in 2005.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gis.dotars.gov.au/auslink/components/content/content.aspx?project_id=3746_4%2C3746_8%2C3856_16%2C3856_44%2C3856_33%2CSNH008%2CSNH020# |title=Dukes Highway pavement rehabilitation |publisher=AusLink |accessdate=2006-09-16[/tpl]
The Dukes Highway runs along the northern side of the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. The route and many of the settlements (including Bordertown) were established in the 1850s to supply water to horses for the gold escorts from the Victorian goldfields to Adelaide.From interpretive signs in Bordertown and along the route
Gold was taken to Adelaide rather than the closer Melbourne because a higher price was offered there. The higher price was offered to stop the South Australian economy from collapsing as all the labourers were heading to the Victorian Goldfields. The 'Bullion Act' was passed and an Assay office was established in Adelaide for the assaying and stamping of gold in 1852. It is claimed that this saved South Australia from bankruptcy.The Story of Keith 1851-1973, Fry, LPH 1953

[[Point-and-shoot camera]]

CATEGORIES: Cameras by type, Digital cameras

A point-and-shoot camera, also called a compact camera, is a still camera designed primarily for simple operation.Brittanica Article Most use focus free lenses or autofocus for focusing, automatic systems for setting the exposure options, and have flash units built in.
Point-and-shoots are by far the best selling type of separate camera, as distinct from camera phones. They are popular with people who do not consider themselves photographers but want an easy to use camera for snapshots of vacations, parties, reunions and other events. Point-and-shoot camera sales declined after about 2010 as smartphones overtook them in such uses.
The term "point-and-shoot" is also used for some camcorders, particularly inexpensive digital models based on MiniDV or DVD media, to describe fully automatic operation (autofocus, automatic gain control and white balance, etc.) with minimal operator interaction except for zoom control and recording buttons.

[[Classical Gas]]

CATEGORIES: Rock instrumentals, Television theme songs, 1968 songs, Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles, Songs from films

"Classical Gas" is an instrumental musical piece composed and originally performed by Mason Williams. Originally released in 1968 on the album The Mason Williams Phonograph Record, it has been re-recorded and re-released numerous times since by Williams. One later version served as the title track of a 1987 album by Williams and the band Mannheim Steamroller.  
Williams was the head writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour at the time of the piece's release and premiered the composition on the show. Williams performed it several times over several episodes. After the piece had reached the Top Ten, Williams asked an experimental filmmaker named Dan McLaughlin to create a video montage of classical art works edited in time to the music, using the visual effect now known as kinestasis. The pioneering work, 3000 Years of Art, premiered in 1968 and may have helped push the song high on the charts; it peaked at number 2 for two weeks in August that year.The Original Classical Gas Video: "3000 Years of Art"  On the US  Easy Listening chart it went to number one for three weeks.[tpl]cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=259[/tpl]  
Williams re-recorded "Classical Gas" as a solo guitar piece on his 1970 album Handmade. This version was re-released by Sony in 2003, after being featured in the film Cheaper by the DozenIMDB reference to CG in Cheaper by the Dozen Soundtrack (which starred Williams's Smothers Brothers protégé, Steve Martin).
During the 1970s and early 1980s, many television stations (such as KIRO-TV in Seattle, WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh, WBAL-TV in Baltimore, KNTV in San Jose, WFTV in Orlando, and WNEP-TV in Wilkes-Barre) used the composition - or a version of it re-recorded by Telesound - as their news theme.
There is a common misconception that "Classical Gas" was composed and performed by Eric Clapton.Classical Gas FAQ Clapton has never recorded a cover of the song. This misconception may possibly be attributed to the fact that Clapton was musical director of, and played much of the guitar music for, the feature film The Story of Us. The version of the song on the film's soundtrack is actually Williams's own solo-guitar re-recording of it, from his 1970 album Handmade.Classical Gas FAQ on Williams's website

Nothing is known of the birth, later life, or death of Saban.  However, he is recorded in some Japanese chronicles, including Shinsen Shōjiroku, as the progenitor of certain clans of Yamato period Japan.  This may indicate that he spent the later part of his life in that country.

USS ''Cabezon'' (SS-334) was a Balao-class submarine of the United States Navy, named for the cabezon, a saltwater fish of sculpin family inhabiting the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans (cabezon means "big head" in Spanish).
Cabezon was launched 27 August 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. T. R. Cooley; and commissioned 30 December 1944, Commander G. W. Lautrup in command.
Cabezon departed New London, Conn., 19 February 1945 for Key West, Fla., where she underwent 3 weeks of training and providing services for the Fleet Sound School. She then sailed via the Panama Canal, to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 March 1945.
From 25 May to 11 July 1945 Cabezon conducted her first war patrol in the Sea of Okhotsk, sinking a 2,631-ton Japanese cargo vessel on 19 June. She refitted at Midway until 4 August, then departed for Saipan to serve as target ship for surface force training exercises. From 7 September 1945 until 12 January 1946 she engaged in local operations and training in Philippine waters, based at Subic Bay.
On 6 February 1946 Cabezon arrived at San Diego, operating from that port until her base was changed to Pearl Harbor. Subsequent to her arrival there on 20 November 1946, she participated in local operations and training cruises for submariners of the Naval Reserve there and on the west coast with intervening cruises to the South Pacific, the North Pacific, and across the Arctic Circle. She also made two cruises to the Far East (18 March – 29 July 1950 and 21 April – 16 October 1952), the second of which included a reconnaissance patrol in the vicinity of La Perouse Strait, between Hokkaidō, Japan, and Sakhalin, U.S.S.R. 
Cabezon sailed for Mare Island 21 April 1953 to start inactivation and was placed out of commission in reserve there 24 October 1953 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Struck from the Naval Register, 15 May 1970, she was sold for scrapping, 28 December 1971.

[[Consistency (database systems)]]

CATEGORIES: Data management, Transaction processing

In database systems, a consistent transaction is one that starts with a database in a consistent state and ends with the database in a consistent state. Consistent state means that there is no violation of any integrity constraints. Consistency may temporarily be violated during execution of the transaction, but must be corrected before changes are permanently committed to the database. If the transaction would leave the database in an illegal state, it is aborted and an error is reported.Database consistency article
Consistency is one of the ACID properties that ensures that any changes to values in an instance are consistent with changes to other values in the same instance. A consistency constraint is a predicate on data which serves as a precondition, post-condition, and transformation condition on any transaction. The database management system (DBMS) assumes that the consistency holds for each transaction in instances. On the other hand, ensuring this property of the transaction is the responsibility of the user.
Example:- Consider a transaction of transferring £50 from account a to account b. 
The steps are: 
1) read(a);
2) a:=a-50;
3) b:=b+50;
4) write(b);
Consistency of this transaction requires that the sum of a and b remain constant before and after the transaction.

CATEGORIES: Chicken breeds, Chicken breeds originating in Thailand, Chicken breeds originating in Japan

Shamo or Ko-Shamo (軍鶏 or シャモ) is a breed of chicken of Japan which was originated in Thailand. The name "Shamo" was a corruption of "Siam" during the early Edo period but has been selectively bred for several hundred years and is very different from the original stock. Shamo in reality is a strain of the Asil (Kaura), taken to Siam (Thailand) and Taiwan and from there to Japan. Its real place of origin is Sindh, Pakistan and secondary place of origin is present day India (Hyderabad Dakkan and Rampure). This breed is used as fighting cocks for naked heeled cockboxing in Japanese cockfights, where it is still legal. It is also bred all over the world for its show quality and unique upright posture. Ko-shamo is mixture of O-shamo with small legged breeds.

The Antigonish Movement later evolved into the Extension Department (now the Coady International Center) of St. Francis Xavier University. 
Father Tompkins believed in the emancipating power of education and sought to improve economic conditions through study groups and co-operative action. "It is not enough to have ideas, we have to put legs on them", he often said. He started the first regional library in Nova Scotia along with the first credit union and a cooperative housing association in Reserve Mines that was dubbed "Tompkinsville". Father Tompkins was the Spiritual founder of the Antigonish Movement.

The Blessed William Knight (1572 – 29 November 1596) was an English layman put to death for his Roman Catholic faith at York, England. With him also suffered the Blesseds George Errington of Herst, Northumberland; William Gibson of Ripon; and Henry Abbot of Howden, Yorkshire.
Knight, apparently a secret convert to the Catholic Church, was the son of a Leonard Knight and lived at South Duffield, a hamlet currently in the Selby District of North Yorkshire. On coming of age, he claimed from his uncle some property which had been left to him by his father, an Anglican, and his uncle who denounced him to the authorities for being a Roman Catholic. He was at once seized and committed to the custody of a pursuivant named Colyer who treated him with indignity and severity.
He was sent in October, 1593, to York Castle, where William Gibson and George Errington were already confined, the latter having been arrested some years before for participation in a rising in the North.
A Church of England clergyman was among the prisoners at York. To gain his freedom, he had recourse to an act of treachery: feigning a desire to convert to the Roman Church, he won the confidence of Knight and his two companions, who explained their faith to him. With the connivance of the authorities, he was directed to Henry Abbot, then at liberty, who endeavoured to procure a priest to reconcile him to the Church. When the minister had sufficient evidence, Abbot was arrested and, together with Knight and his two comrades, accused of attempting to persuade the clergyman to embrace Roman Catholicism — an act of treason under the penal laws. The men were found guilty, and, with the exception of Abbot who was executed later, suffered hanging, drawing and quartering at York on 29 November 1596. Knight was about 24 years old when he died.
Knight was one of the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987 during a trip to Great Britain.Homily of Pope John Paul II

A commendatory abbot is an ecclesiastic, or sometimes a layman, who holds an abbey in commendam, drawing its revenues but not exercising any authority over its inner monastic discipline. If a commendatory abbot is an ecclesiastic, however, he may have limited jurisdiction.
Originally only vacant abbeys, or those that were temporarily without an actual superior, were given in commendam, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed. An abbey is held in commendam, i.e. provisorily, in distinction to one held in titulum, which is a permanent benefice. Catholic Encyclopedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07719a.htm

[[Lay abbot]]
CATEGORIES: Investiture Controversy

Lay abbot (abbatocomes, abbas laicus, abbas miles) is a name used to designate a layman on whom a king or someone in authority bestowed an abbey as a reward for services rendered; he had charge of the estate belonging to it, and was entitled to part of the income. 
This custom existed principally in the Frankish Empire from the eighth century until the ecclesiastical reforms of the eleventh. Charles Martel was the first to bestow outright extensive existing ecclesiastical property upon laymen, political friends and soldiers. Earlier, the Merovingians had bestowed church lands on laymen, or at least allowed them their possession and use, though not ownership. 
Numerous synods held in France in the sixth and seventh centuries passed decrees against this abuse of church property. The Merovingian kings were also in the habit of appointing abbots to monasteries which they had founded; moreover, many monasteries, though not founded by the king, placed themselves under royal patronage in order to share his protection, and so became possessions of the Crown. This custom of the Merovingian rulers was taken as a precedent by the French kings for rewarding laymen with abbeys, or giving them to bishops in commendam. "Under Charles Martel the Church was greatly injured by this abuse, not only in her possessions, but also in her religious life."[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Lay Abbot[/tpl] St. Boniface and later Hincmar of Reims picture most dismally the consequent downfall of church discipline, and though St. Boniface tried zealously and even successfully to reform the Frankish Church, the bestowal of abbeys on secular abbots was not abolished. Under Pepin the monks were permitted, in case their abbey should fall into secular hands, to go over to another community.
Charlemagne also frequently gave church property, and sometimes abbeys, in feudal tenure. Louis the Pious aided St. Benedict of Aniane in his endeavours to reform the monastic life. In order to accomplish this it was necessary to restore the free election of abbots, and the appointment as well of blameless monks as heads of the monastic houses. Although Louis shared these principles, he continued to bestow abbeys on laymen, and his sons imitated him.
The important Abbey of St. Riquier (Centula) in Picardy had secular abbots from the time of Charlemagne, who had given it to his friend Angilbert, the poet and the lover of his daughter Bertha, and father of her two sons (see Saint Angilbert). After Angilbert's death in 814, the abbey was given to other laymen. 
Various synods of the ninth century passed decrees against this custom; the Synod of Diedenhofen (October, 844) decreed in its third canon, that abbeys should no longer remain in the power of laymen, but that monks should be their abbotsKarl Josef von Hefele, Konziliengeschichte, 2nd ed., IV, 110 In like manner the Synods of Meaux and Paris (845-846) complained that the monasteries held by laymen had fallen into decay, and emphasized the king's duty in this respect.Hefele, op. cit., IV, 115 But abbeys continued to be bestowed upon laymen, especially in France and Lorraine, e.g. St. Evre near Toul, in the reign of Lothair I. Lothair II, however, restored it to ecclesiastical control in 858, but the same king gave Bonmoutier to a layman; and the Abbeys of St. Germain and St. Martin, in the Diocese of Toul, were also given to secular abbots. In the Diocese of Metz, the Abbey of Gorze was long in the hands of laymen, and under them fell into decay. Stavelot and Malmedy, in the Diocese of Liège, were in the eleventh century bestowed on a certain Count Raginarius, as also St. Maximin near Trier on a Count Adalhard, etc.Albert Hauck, Kirchengeschichte Deutschland, II, 598 In 888 a Synod of Mainz decreed (canon xxv) that the secular abbots should place able provosts and provisors over their monasteries.
In a synod held at Trosly, in the Diocese of Soissons, in 909, sharp complaints were made (ch. iii) about the lives of monks; many convents, it was said, were governed by laymen, whose wives and children, soldiers and dogs, were housed in the precincts of the religious. To better these conditions it was necessary, the synod declared, to restore the regular abbots and abbesses; at the same time ecclesiastical canons and royal capitularies declared laymen quite devoid of authority in church affairs.Hefele, op. cit., IV, 572-73 Lay abbots existed in the tenth century, also in the eleventh. Gosfred, Duke of Aquitaine, was Abbot of the monastery of St. Hilary at Poitiers, and as such he published the decrees issued (1078) at the Synod of Poitiers.Hefele, op. cit., V, 116 It was only through the so-called investitures conflict that the Church was freed from secular domination; the reforms brought about by the papacy put an end to the bestowal of abbeys upon laymen.

Cipitio is a legendary character found in salvadoran folklore.  He is generally portrayed as a  8-10 year old boy with a big conical wizard hat.  His name is taken from the Nahuatl word for child: "Cipit" or "Cipote". Some also relate his name to the deity Xipe Totec.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl] 
According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziquet, now commonly known as La Siguanaba, and "Lucero de la mañana" (Spanish for morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair.  When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god Teotl. Ziguet and Cipitio were cursed and condemned by Teotl.  Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents.  Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that Cipitio has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.
Cipitio is represented as liking to eat ashes,Kephart. throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies,Cordova 19. and likes to eat a variety of banana called "Guineo Majoncho". He could also "Teleport" anywhere he wants. 
A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book Cuentos de Cipotes by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador Salarrué.
In a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons. Each episode features the problems that Salvadoran children find in their communities, families and schools, Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

[[Flores giant rat]]
CATEGORIES: Old World rats and mice, Rodents of Indonesia, Flores Island (Indonesia), Animals described in 1892

The Flores giant rat (Papagomys armandvillei) is a rodent of the family Muridae that occurs on the island of Flores in Indonesia.[tpl]MSW3 Muroidea | id = 13001634 | page = 1430[/tpl] It is found in primary, secondary and disturbed forest over a wide range of elevations. Head and body length is 41–45 cm (16.1–17.7 in.) and tail length is 33–70 cm (13–27.5 in.), making the Flores giant rat at least twice the size of an average brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) with a 25 cm long body and 15 cm long tail. It is the only extant species in the genus Papagomys.
Guy Musser describes the rat as having small, round ears, a chunky body and a small tail, and as appearing to be adapted for life on the ground with refuge in burrows. The rat has dense dark hair (pelage). Analysis of the teeth of the Flores giant rat suggests that the rat has a diet of leaves, buds, fruit, and certain kinds of insect as inferred by large hypsodont teeth.[ref]
</ref>
P. armandvillei is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. Threats include subsistence hunting and predation by dogs and cats. A related species, P. theodorverhoeveni, is known from subfossil remains from 3,000 – 4,000 years ago. This species is presumed to be extinct, but may still exist on the island.

The 15 cm sIG 33 (''schweres Infanterie Geschütz 33'') was the standard German heavy infantry gun used in the Second World War. It was the largest weapon ever classified as an infantry gun by any nation.Hogg, p. 26 Sources differ on the development history, but the gun itself was of conventional design. Early production models were horse-drawn, with wooden wheels. Later production models had pressed steel wheels, with solid rubber tires and air brakes for motor towing. The sIG 33 was rather heavy for its mission and it was redesigned in the late 1930s to incorporate light alloys in an effort to save weight. This saved about [tpl]convert|150|kg|lb[/tpl], but the outbreak of war forced the reversion back to the original design as the Luftwaffe had a higher priority for light alloys before more than a few hundred were made. A new carriage, made entirely of light alloys, was tested around 1939, but was not accepted for service.

Mabel Poulton (29 July 1901 – 21 December 1994) was an English film actress, popular in Britain during the era of silent films.
Born in London, England, Poulton was working as a stenographer and entered films by chance. Her first role in George Pearson's Nothing Else Matters (1920) was opposite Betty Balfour, who was also making her debut, and the film was a success. Over the next several years, Poulton was cast in a succession of roles, and usually played feisty or mischievous characters. A petite blonde, she also became well regarded for her fashion style, and was a highly recognisable celebrity. In 1928, she starred in The Constant Nymph by Adrian Brunel and received excellent reviews for her performance. By the end of the decade she was considered to be one of Britain's leading screen actresses along with Balfour, and was described by critics as Balfour's only serious rival.
The advent of sound film brought a premature end to Poulton's film career. The addition of the microphone revealed Poulton's broad Cockney accent, which was at odds with the characters she had become identified with. Like Clara Bow who faced the same problem as a result of her Brooklyn accent, Poulton struggled to maintain her status. Also like Bow, she attempted to mount a comeback in the mid-1930s, which was well publicised but unsuccessful. She made her final film appearance in 1936.
She died in London in 1994 aged 93.

Aloys Sprenger (born 3 September 1813, in Nassereith, Tyrol; died 19 December 1893 in Heidelberg) was an Austrian orientalist. 
Sprenger studied medicine, natural sciences as well as oriental languages at the University of Vienna. In 1836 he moved to London, where he worked with the Earl of Munster on the latter's „Geschichte der Kriegswissenschaften bei den mohammedanischen Völkern“, ‘History of Military Science among the Muslim Peoples’, and thence in 1843 to Calcutta, where he became principal of Delhi College. In this capacity he had many textbooks translated into Hindustani from European languages. 
In 1848 he was sent to Lucknow, to prepare a catalogue of the royal library there, the first volume of which appeared in Calcutta in 1854. This book, with its lists of Persian poets, its careful description of all the chief works of Persian poetry and its valuable biographical material, became a worthy guide for the exploration of Persian literature. 
In 1850 Sprenger was named examiner, official government interpreter, and secretary of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. He published many works while holding this latter position, among them “Dictionary of the Technical terms used in the sciences of the Musulmans” (1854) and “Ibn Hajar's biographical dictionary of persons who knew Mohammed” (1856). 
Sprenger took a position as professor of oriental languages at the University of Bern in 1857, moving in 1881 to Heidelberg. His voluminous collection of Arabic, Persian, Hindustani and other manuscripts and printed material was eventually acquired by the Royal Library in Berlin.

La Niña (Spanish for The Girl) was one of the three ships used by Christopher Columbus in his first voyage towards the Indies in 1492. The ship was originally called the Santa Clara, but was changed to La Niña. The name Niña was probably a pun on the name of her owner, Juan Niño of Moguer.*[tpl]cite book |first1=Patrick J. |last1=Murphy |first2=Ray W. |last2=Coye |title=Mutiny and Its Bounty: Leadership Lessons from the Age of Discovery |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/Book.asp?isbn=9780300170283 |date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|ISBN=9780300170283 |ref=harv[/tpl] She was a standard caravel-type vessel.
The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the caravel-type Pinta and the carrack-type Santa María.  The Niña was by far Columbus's favorite. She was originally lateen sail rigged caravela latina, but she was re-rigged as caravela redonda at Azores with square sails for better ocean performance. There is no authentic documentation on the specifics of the Niña's design, although Michele de Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, mentioned that the Nina was "about 60 toneladas" (60 tons), which may indicate a medium sized Caravel of around 50 feet (15 m) in length on deck.[tpl]cite book|first=William D.

It was greatly surpassed in size by ships like the Peter von Danzig of the Hanseatic League, built in 1462, [tpl]convert|51|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and the English carrack Grace Dieu, built during the period 1420-1439, [tpl]convert|66.4|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and weighing between 1,400 tons and 2,750 tons.

La Pinta (Spanish for The Pint (liquid measure) or simply "The Painted", as a ships depth would be indicated by the painted markings on its hull) was the fastest of the three ships used by Christopher Columbus in his first transatlantic voyage in 1492. The New World was first sighted by Rodrigo de Triana on the Pinta on October 12, 1492.  The owner of the Pinta was Cristobal Quintero. The Quintero brothers were ship owners from Palos.  The owner of the ship allowed Martin Alonso Pinzon to take over the ship so he could keep an eye on the ship.
The Pinta was a caravel-type vessel. By tradition Spanish ships were named after saints and usually given nicknames. Thus, the Pinta, like the Niña, was not the ship's actual name. The actual name of the Pinta is unknown. The origin of the ship is disputed but is believed to have been built in Spain in the year 1441. It was later rebuilt for use by Christopher Columbus.

Oskar Schlemmer (4 September 1888 – 13 April 1943) was a German painter, sculptor, designer and choreographer associated with the Bauhaus school. In 1923 he was hired as Master of Form at the Bauhaus theatre workshop, after working some time at the workshop of sculpture. His most famous work is "Triadisches Ballett," in which the actors are transfigured from the normal to geometrical shapes. Also in Slat Dance and Treppenwitz, the performers' costumes make them into living sculpture, as if part of the scenery.

[[Jagdpanzer IV]]

CATEGORIES: World War II tank destroyers of Germany

The ''Jagdpanzer'' IV, Sd.Kfz. 162, was a tank destroyer based on the Panzer IV chassis built in three main variants. As one of the casemate-style turretless Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer, literally "hunting tank") designs, it was developed against the wishes of Heinz Guderian, the inspector general of the Panzertruppen, as a replacement for the Sturmgeschütz III (StuG III). Guderian objected against the needless, in his eyes, diversion of resources from Panzer IV tank production, as the Stug III and Sturmgeschütz IV were still more than adequate for their role.
Officially, only the L/48-armed vehicle was named Jagdpanzer IV. The L/70-armed vehicle was named Panzer IV/70. In this article, both versions are referred to in general as Jagdpanzer IV, except in the variants and surviving vehicles section.

[[Homosociality]]
CATEGORIES: LGBT terms, Queer theory, Sexual orientation and society, Sociological terminology

In sociology, homosociality describes same-sex relationships that are not of a romantic or sexual nature, such as friendship, mentorship, or others. The opposite of homosocial is heterosocial, preferring non-sexual relations with the opposite sex. In group relations involving more than two individuals, the relation can be either homosocial (involving same-sex social relations), bisocial involving social relation with both sexes or heterosocial involving only opposite sex. 
Homosocial was popularized by Eve Sedgwick in her discussion of male homosocial desire.J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (New York 1995) p. 138 Jean Lipman-Blumen had earlier (1976) defined homosociality as a preference for members of one's own sex – a social rather than a sexual preference.Merl Storr, Latex and Lingerie (2003) p. 39-40

Nereus, Achilleus, Domitilla, and Pancras are venerated as martyrs of the Roman Catholic Church.
In the present General Roman Calendar, revised in 1969, Saints Nereus and Achilleus (together) and Saint Pancras have distinct celebrations (optional memorials) on 12 May. Saint Domitilla is not included in the revised calendar, because the liturgical honours once paid to her "have no basis in tradition".Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana), p. 123
The Tridentine Calendar had on 12 May a joint feast (semidouble rank) of Nereus, Achilleus and Pancras. The name of Domitilla was added in 1595. The joint celebration of Nereus, Achilleus, Domitilla and Pancras continued with that ranking (see General Roman Calendar of 1954 until the revision of 1960, when it was reclassified as a third-class feast (see General Roman Calendar of 1962).

The Sitwells (Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, Sacheverell Sitwell), from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, were three siblings, who formed an identifiable literary and artistic clique around themselves in London in the period roughly 1916 to 1930. This was marked by some well-publicised events, the most prominent of which was probably  Edith's Façade with music by William Walton, with its public debut in 1923. All three Sitwells wrote; for a while their circle was considered by some to rival Bloomsbury, though others dismissed them as attention-seekers rather than serious artists.

[[Giles of Assisi]]

Blessed Giles ([tpl]lang-la|Aegidius[/tpl]) of Assisi, O.F.M., ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1190 – 1262) was one of the original companions of St. Francis of Assisi and holds the foremost place among the companions of St. Francis. St. Francis called him "The Knight of our Round Table".
Of Giles' origins and early life nothing certain is known, other than that he was a simple farmer. In April, 1209, moved by the example of two leading fellow-Assisians, who had already become the first followers of St. Francis, he begged permission to join the little band. and on the feast of St. George (23 April) was invested in a poor religious habit which St. Francis had begged for him. Almost immediately afterwards he set out with St. Francis to preach in the Marches of Ancona. He accompanied the saint to Rome when the first Rule was approved orally by Pope Innocent III, and appears to have then received the monastic tonsure. About 1212 Giles made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. James at Compostella, in Spain. Shortly after his return to Assisi he started for Jerusalem, to venerate the Holy Places, visiting on his way home the Italian shrines of St. Michael, at Monte Gargano, and St. Nicholas, at Bari. He was next found in Rome and still later at Tunis.
In these journeys Giles was always at pains to procure by manual labor what food and shelter he needed. At Ancona he made reed baskets; at Brindisi he carried water and helped to bury the dead; at Rome he cut wood, trod the wine-press, and gathered nuts; while the guest of a cardinal at Rieti he insisted on sweeping the house and cleaning the knives. A keen observer of men and events, Giles acquired in the course of these travels much valuable knowledge and experience, which he turned to good account. For he lost no occasion to preach to the people. His sermons, if such they can be called, were brief and heartfelt talks, replete with homely wisdom; he never minced his words, but spoke to all with apostolic freedom. After some years of activity Giles was assigned by St. Francis to the hermitage of Monteripido in the region of Perugia, where he began a life of contemplation and ecstasy which continued with very visible increase until his death.
It was in 1262, on the fifty-second anniversary of his reception into the Order of Friars Minor, that Aegidius died, already revered as a saint. His immemorial cultus was confirmed by Pope Pius VI in 1777, and his feast day is celebrated on the 23 April.
Giles was a stranger to theological and classical learning, but by constant contemplation of heavenly things, and by the divine love with which he was inflamed, he acquired that fullness of holy wisdom which filled his contemporaries with wonder, and which drew men of every condition, even the Pope himself, to Perugia to hear from Giles' lips the Word of Life. The answers and advice these visitors received were remembered, talked over, and committed to writing, and thus was formed a collection of the familiar "Dicta" or "Sayings" of Brother Giles, which have often been edited in Latin and translated into different languages. St. Bonaventure held these "Sayings" in high esteem, and they are cited in the works of many subsequent ascetical writers. They are short, pithy, popular counsels on Christian perfection, applicable to all classes. Saturated with mysticism, yet exquisitely human and possessing a picturesque vein of originality, they faithfully reflect the early Franciscan spirit and teaching.
The latest and best edition of the "Dicta" is that published at Quaracchi, in 1905. There is a critical English translation of the same:

Óengus mac Óengobann, better known as Saint Óengus of Tallaght or Óengus the Culdee,This nickname was first assigned to him, on no apparent authority, by John Colgan in the 17th century. was an Irish bishop, reformer and writer, who flourished in the first quarter of the 9th century and is held to be the author of the Félire Óengusso ("The Martyrology of Óengus") and possibly the Martyrology of Tallaght.
Little of Óengus's life and career is reliably attested. The most important sources include internal evidence from the Félire, a later Middle Irish preface to that work, a biographic poem beginning Aíbind suide sund amne ("Delightful to sit here thus") and the entry for his feast-day inserted into the Martyrology of Tallaght.

[[Affinity (canon law)]]
CATEGORIES: Canon law (Catholic Church), Marriage (Catholic Church)

In canon law, affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple due to the relationship which the parties to a prospective or existing marriage have to each other as a result of a kinship relationship created by another marriage or as a result of out of marriage intercourse. The relationships that give raise to the impediment have varied over time, and there are varied views between various Christian denominations as to which relationships result in an impediment to marriage. Marriages and sexual relations between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as incestuous.
Today, the relevant principle within the Catholic Church is that "affinity does not beget affinity"—i.e., there is no affinity between one spouse's relatives and the other spouse's relatives. Canon 109 of the Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church provides that affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple, and is a relationship which "arises from a valid marriage, even if not consummated, and exists between a man and the blood relatives of the woman and between the woman and the blood relatives of the man."1983 Codex Juris Canonici, New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 109 §1 Also, Affinity "is reckoned in such a way that the blood relations of the man are related by affinity to the woman in the same line and the same degree, and vice versa."1983 Codex Juris Canonici, New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 109 §2

CATEGORIES: Military units and formations of NATO

The Allied Command Europe Mobile Force - Land (ACE Mobile Force-Land or AMF(L)) was a small NATO quick reaction force, headquartered at Heidelberg, Germany, active from 1960 to 2002. It formed part of Allied Command Europe (ACE), headquartered at SHAPE at Casteau, Belgium.
The AMF-L was intended as a multinational force that could be quickly despatched to any part of ACE's command area - from North Norway, to Germany, to eastern Turkey - to demonstrate the solidarity of the alliance and its ability to resist all forms of aggression against any member state. During the Cold War the AMF-L did frequent exercises in North Norway (Exercises Adventure Express, Arctic Express & Ardent Ground, among others) and in other areas, but was first deployed operationally in 1991 during the Gulf War, when part of its air component was despatched to watch the Turkish borders, in the face of a potential threat to a member's territory. 
The land component of the force, consisting of a brigade-sized formation of about 5,000 personnel, was composed of units from 14 NATO states.
The AMF(L) was one of the NATO formations deployed to Norway during Exercise Strong Resolve 1998.
The AMF(L) formed the core of the Albania Force (AFOR), a NATO-led international force responsible for establishing and delivering humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo in Albania during the Kosovo crisis in 1999. It was led by Major General John Reith, Commander AMF(L).
The Immediate Reaction Task Force (Land) (IRTF-L) was a novel command and control concept successfully developed and evaluated by the AMF(L) between 1999 and 2001. The IRTF(L) concept allowed the AMF(L), an existing Immediate Reaction Force multinational brigade HQ, to command a divisional sized force with minimal augmentation and no intermediate HQs. The trial concluded in December 2001. HQ AMF(L) was disbanded on October 31, 2002 and has since been replaced by the NATO Response Force.NATO Press Release (2002)098 - 12 August 2002

[[Independence (mathematical logic)]]

CATEGORIES: Proof theory

In mathematical logic, independence refers to the unprovability of a sentence from other sentences.
A sentence σ is independent of a given first-order theory T if T neither proves nor refutes σ; that is, it is impossible to prove σ from T, and it is also impossible to prove from T that σ is false. Sometimes, σ is said (synonymously) to be undecidable from T; this is not the same meaning of "decidability" as in a decision problem.
A theory T is independent if each axiom in T is not provable from the remaining axioms in T. A theory for which there is an independent set of axioms is independently axiomatizable.

Eumenes III (Εὐμένης Γʹ; originally named Aristonicus, in Greek Aristonikos Ἀριστόνικος) was the pretender to the throne of Pergamon.
When the Pergamene king, Attalus III (138–133 BC), died in 133 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Because the Romans were slow in securing their claim, Aristonicus, who claimed to be the illegitimate son of the earlier Pergamene king, Eumenes II (197–160 BC), father of Attalus III, filled the power vacuum, claiming the throne and taking the dynastic name Eumenes III. 
At first he tried to gain support by promising freedom to the Greek cities of the coast.  When this failed, he sought support in the interior, promising freedom to both slaves and serfs.  To what extent he was a social revolutionary or simply a dynastic contender to the throne is uncertain.  He was joined by Blossius of Cumae, the Stoic, who had been a supporter of Tiberius Gracchus and promised to found a state called Heliopolis in which all were to be free.  The first army sent against him, in 131 BC, was led by Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, who was killed in battle. However, Eumenes III was defeated and captured  in 129 BC by a Roman force under Marcus Perperna, the consul for 130 BC, in the siege of Thyatira. After his surrender, he was paraded through Rome, then executed by strangulation.

Jean Baptiste Audebert (1759 – December 1800) was a French artist and naturalist.
Audebert was born at Rochefort. He studied painting and drawing at Paris, and gained considerable reputation as a miniature-painter. Employed in preparing plates for the Histoire des cloportes of Guillaume-Antoine Olivier, he acquired a taste for natural history. His first original work, Histoire naturelle des singes appeared in 1800, illustrated by sixty-two folio plates, drawn and engraved by himself. The coloring in these plates was unusually beautiful, and was applied by a method devised by himself.
His work was also included in the bestselling Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/sep02/article5.html|title=In search of La Pérouse|last=Duyker|first=Edward|date=September 2002 |work=NLA news Volume XII Number 12|publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]
Audebert died in Paris, leaving complete materials for another work, Histoire des colibris, oiseaux-mouches, jacamars et promerops, which was published in 1802. Two hundred copies were printed in folio, one hundred in large quarto, and fifteen were printed with the whole text in letters of gold. Another work, left unfinished, was also published after the author's death, L'Histoire des grimpereaux et des oiseaux de paradis. The last two works also appeared together in two volumes, Oiseaux dorés, ou à reflets métalliques (1801-1802) written with his friend Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot. In this work he printed  lines of gold and silver over the painted colours of the birds to give them a metallic sheen imitating the iridescent colours of nature.

[[Rack (torture)]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient instruments of torture, Medieval instruments of torture, Modern instruments of torture, European instruments of torture

The rack is a torture device consisting of a rectangular, usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one or both ends. The victim's ankles are fastened to one roller and the wrists are chained to the other. As the interrogation progresses, a handle and ratchet attached to the top roller are used to very gradually stepwise increase the tension on the chains, inducing excruciating pain. By means of pulleys and levers this roller could be rotated on its own axis, thus straining the ropes until the sufferer's joints were dislocated and eventually separated. Additionally, if muscle fibres are stretched excessively, they lose their ability to contract, rendering them ineffective.
One gruesome aspect of being stretched too far on the rack is the loud popping noises made by snapping cartilage, ligaments or bones. One powerful method for putting pressure upon prisoners was to force them to watch someone else being subjected to the rack. Confining the prisoner on the rack enabled further tortures to be simultaneously applied, typically including burning the flanks with hot torches or candles or using pincers made with specially roughened grips to tear out the nails of the fingers and toes.

Migros ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈmiɡro[/tpl]) is Switzerland's largest retail company, its largest supermarket chain and largest employer. It is also one of the forty largest retailers in the world. It co-founded Turkey's largest retailer, Migros Türk, which became independent of Migros Switzerland in 1975.
The name comes from the French "mi" for half or mid-way and "gros", which means wholesale. Thus the word connotes prices that are halfway between retail and wholesale.
The logo of the company is a large orange M, which some Swiss newspapers call "the orange giant" (German: oranger Riese, French: géant orange). The firm's loyalty card is the M-cumulus card (a play on the word accumulate and a type of cloud formation).

The Constitutional Council ([tpl]lang-fr|Conseil Constitutionnel[/tpl];  [tpl]IPA-fr|kɔ̃sɛj kɔ̃stitysjɔˈnɛl[/tpl]) is the highest constitutional authority in France. It was established by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic on 4 October 1958, and its duty is to ensure that the principles and rules of the constitution be upheld.
Its main activity is to rule on whether proposed statutes conform with the Constitution, after they have been voted by Parliament and before they are signed into law by the President of the Republic (a priori review); since 1 March 2010, individual citizens party to a trial or lawsuit can also ask for the Council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional. In 1971, the Council ruled that conformity with the Constitution entails conformity with two texts referred to by the preamble of that constitution: the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the preamble of the constitution of the Fourth Republic, both of which list constitutional rights (e.g., freedom of speech).

CATEGORIES: 1727 births, 1777 deaths, 18th-century German people, Britain's German allies during the American Revolution, British military personnel killed in the American Revolutionary War

Friedrich Baum (1727–1777) was a German dragoon Lieutenant Colonel of Brunswick in British service during the American Revolutionary War. Baum served under another German officier, Major General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, commanding the Dragoon Regiment "Prinz Ludwig" of the Braunschweiger Jäger in support of General John Burgoyne's 1777 campaign to attack the Lake Champlain-Hudson River corridor, which ended in Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga on October 15, 1777.
For Baum, the campaign ended at the Battle of Bennington, on August 16, 1777. Arriving in Canada with the Brunswick army in the winter of 1776, Burgoyne detailed Baum with around 600 Brunswickers, British, and Indians from Fort Edward to try to collect provisions, horses, and Loyalist reinforcements for Burgoyne's main force for the march south toward Albany. However, nearly 2,000 rebels, consisting of New Hampshire forces under John Stark and the renmants of Seth Warner's Green Mountain Boys following the costly Battle of Hubbardton, were arrayed against Baum's men. Also among Stark's forces were Massachusetts men under Reverend Thomas Allen, leading a contingent of Pittsfield militia.  Allen, who had been outraged at the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga to Burgoyne at the beginning of July, complained to Stark that if his men did not get to fight at Bennington they would never answer another call to arms.
Although Baum had served in several engagements in Europe during the Seven Years' War, he had little battlefield command experience. In contrast, his adversary Stark had served with Robert Rogers' Rangers, including the Battle of Ticonderoga; and he had distinguished himself as an American leader at Bunker Hill, Trenton, and Princeton.
Baum's lack of experience showed at Bennington, where he encamped his forces in such a way that they were separated and unable to communicate easily with each other. Communications were also hampered in some degree by only German-speaking Baum's own inability to speak English.
Baum had been assigned a loyalist from the nearby region to guide his forces and attest to the character of any indigenous people encountered along the way. According to a field report that was later published in the London Gazette by Burgoyne himself:
Putting his superior numbers to best use, Stark surrounded each of Baum's forces and attacked simultaneously, overwhelming each redoubt. In the melée, Baum was captured after sustaining a mortal stomach wound, from which his surgeon, Julius Friedrich Wasmus, also captured, was unable to save him.
Seeing he was badly outnumbered, Baum had requested reinforcements from Burgoyne, who sent Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann and a corps of light infantrymen and Brunswick grenadiers to support him. However, Breymann, who disliked Baum, marched slowly to the site, making less than one mile per hour, arriving after Baum had already been overrun and captured.

[[James Hack Tuke]]

CATEGORIES: English Quakers, 1819 births, 1896 deaths, Tuke family of York

 
James Hack Tuke (13 September 1819 – 13 January 1896) was born at York, England, the son of Samuel Tuke.ODNB article by Miller Christy, ‘Tuke, James Hack (1819–1896)’, rev. Peter Gray, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27806, accessed 1 April 2008.
He was educated at the Religious Society of Friends school there, and after working for a time in his father's wholesale tea business, became in 1852 a partner in the banking firm of Sharples and Co., and went to live at Hitchin in Hertfordshire.
For eighteen years he was treasurer of the Friends Foreign Mission Association, and for eight years chairman of the Friends Central Education Board. But he is chiefly remembered for his philanthropic work in Ireland, which was in a great measure the result of a visit to Connaught In 1847, and of the scenes of distress which he there witnessed. In addition to relief, his eye-witness testimony proved invaluable in bringing further relief to the west of Ireland Christine Kinealy, Charity and the Great Hunger in Ireland. The Kindness of Strangers, Bloomsbury, 2013 In 1880, accompanied by WE Forster, he spent two months in the West of Ireland distributing relief which had been privately subscribed by Friends in England.
Letters descriptive of the state of things he saw were published in The Times, and in his pamphlet, Irish Distress and its Remedies (1880), he pointed out that Irish distress was due to economic rather than political difficulties, and advocated state-aided land purchase, peasant proprietorship, light railways, government help for the fishing and local industries, and family emigration for the poorest peasants. From 1882 to 1884 he worked continuously in Ireland superintending the emigration of poor families to the United States and the Colonies.
The failure of the potato crop in Ireland in 1885 again called forth Tuke's energy, and on the invitation of the government, aided by public subscription, he purchased and distributed seed potatoes in order to avert a famine. To his reports of this distribution and his letters to The Times, which were reprinted under the title The Condition of Donegal (1889), were due in a great measure the bill passed for the construction of light railways in 1889 and the Irish Land Act which established the Congested Districts Board in 1891.
See Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons (1815–1816); Dr Conolly, Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraints (1856); Dr Hack Tuke, Chapters in the History of the Insane in the British Isles (1882).

Samuel Tuke (31 July 1784–14 October 1857) was a Quaker philanthropist and mental-health reformer. He was born in York, England.
He greatly advanced the cause of the amelioration of the condition of the insane, and devoted himself largely to the York Retreat. The methods of treatment pursued there were made more widely known by his Description of the Retreat near York.[tpl]cite book|last=Tuke|first=Samuel 1813|title=Description of the Retreat|publisher=Process Press|date =1996|location=London|isbn=  1-899209-04-2[/tpl] In this work Samuel Tuke referred to the Retreat's methods as moral treatment, borrowed from the French "traitement moral" being used to describe the work of Jean-Baptiste Pussin and Philippe Pinel in France (and in the original French referring more to morale in the sense of the emotions and self-esteem, rather than rights and wrongs). Samuel Tuke also published Practical Hints on the Construction and Economy of Pauper Lunatic Asylums (1815). 
Samuel was part of a Quaker family. He was the son of Henry Tuke and the grandson of William Tuke, who founded the York Retreat. Samuel Tuke's two sons James Hack Tuke and Daniel Hack Tuke were also active in humanitarian concerns.
The Retreat still provides mental healthcare for the population of York and the wider community. Samuel Tuke is buried in the Quaker cemetery within the hospital grounds.

Charles-Geneviève-Louis-Auguste-André-Timothée d'Éon de Beaumont (5 October 1728 – 21 May 1810), usually known as the Chevalier d'Éon, was a French diplomat, spy and soldier, whose first 49 years were spent as a man, and whose last 33 years were spent as a woman.  From 1777, d'Éon claimed to be anatomically a woman, and dressed as such.  Doctors who examined the body after d'Éon's death discovered that he was anatomically male.
The title chevalier, French for knight, refers to the honorary title "chevalier des ordres du Roi", to which d'Éon was entitled after receiving the Order of Saint-Louis in 1763.

Fernando Sancho (January 7, 1916 – July 31, 1990) was a Spanish actor. Sancho was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, Spain, and died in Madrid after surgery.
He was often typecast as a Mexican bandit in paella and spaghetti westerns, including The Big Gundown (directed by Sergio Sollima), A Pistol for Ringo and Return of Ringo (directed by Duccio Tessari), Arizona Colt (directed by Michele Lupo), Minnesota Clay (directed by Sergio Corbucci), and Sartana (directed by Gianfranco Parolini). Though (almost) always given the same role — a Mexican bandit chief — Sancho was a strong actor, and became one of the icons of these films.
He also appeared in a number of Spanish horror movies in the '60s and '70s. One of the better known horror parts was the role of a corrupt small town mayor in El Ataque de los Muertos sin Ojos (AKA Return of the Blind Dead), directed by Amando de Ossorio. Another notable horror film was Orloff and the Invisible Man (1971), directed by Pierre Chevalier and starring Howard Vernon, an unofficial continuation of the Dr. Orloff saga begun by Jess Franco in The Awful Dr. Orloff (1962).  Sancho also turned up briefly in the epic Lawrence of Arabia playing the Turkish sergeant who arrests Lawrence in Deraa.
It is possible that Fernando Sancho's mother was Greek; he could certainly speak Greek trippingly, and acted in several Greek movies, all depicting moments of Greek martial history.
Sancho had a very prolific career and remained active in film up to his death. He made larger than life characters his specialty, and was a similarly 'big' character off screen as well — popular both with audiences, and with his fellow actors.

Henry is a comic strip created in 1932 by Carl Anderson. The title character is a young bald boy who is mute (and sometimes drawn minus a mouth). With the exception of a few early episodes, the comic strip character communicates only through pantomime, a situation which changed when Henry moved into comic books.
The Saturday Evening Post was the first publication to feature Henry, a series which began March 19, 1932, when Anderson was 67 years old. The series of cartoons continued in that magazine for two years in various formats of single panel, multiple panels or two panels.

[[Dreamlin]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic music groups, Belarusian electronic music groups, Electronica musicians, Belarusian music, Musical groups by country, Music of Belarus

Dreamlin is an electronic music group from Belarus. 
Dreamlin, hailing from Minsk, Belarus started when Denis «C4» Korabkov, who used to play guitar with a local cult, psychedelic reggae band at the time met Egor Kunovsky, who had long been involved with music software and computers. 
In 2000, they teamed together as Dreamlin and had their music used in several underground films and videos worldwide as well hitting the #1 artist spot at Ampcast.com in summer 2001. 
In 2002 they started playing to live crowds and soon became the most requested electronic act in the country. Their constant love to mixing electronic and live instruments brought on stage a vocalist and several other people who played guitars, drums and electronic drums, flute and all kinds of percussion. 
By 2004 Egor plays most of the gigs together with multyinstrumentalist Andrey Karpovich (Andre Karp), while Denis prefers studio work, now not only with Dreamlin project. Collaborative tracks do not include just local live musicians; the geography of people who worked with Dreamlin spreads from Finland to Hawaii. 
The style of the music that Dreamlin produces is not limited to a genre or two. No matter that on most flyers Dreamlin is listed as downtempo, you can hear almost any kind of electronic music except trance in their sets. All kinds of broken beats are preferred, but some mellow chill-out house tune is also quite likely to be heard.
The first album, The Colour Of The City was released in 2004 in Belarus, in 2005 in Russia and 2006 saw it available on digital download sites worldwide.
In 2006 Dreamlin was first invited to play a gig outside of ex-USSR and later was listed at the biggest open-air event in Belarus, which takes place yearly at Borovaya aero-club near Minsk. 
In 2007 Andrey has left the country and returned only in 2009 when the band finally started to make songs with Andrey's vocals. 
The second standalone release of music by Dreamlin is the Monday Islands EP released in 2008 as digital download.

(6 March 1881 – 27 August 1966), was a writer and translator of Russian-Jewish background who spent his later life in exile.
Cournos was born in Zhitomir, Russian Empire, and his first language was Yiddish; he studied Russian, German, and Hebrew with a tutor at home.Smith, "Aleksei Remizov's English-language Translators," p. 190. His family emigrated to Philadelphia when he was ten years old, and his primary language became English. In June 1912, he moved to London, where he freelanced as an interviewer and critic for both UK and US publications and began his literary career as a poet and, later, novelist. He later emigrated to the USA, where he spent the rest of his life.
He was one of the Imagist poets, but is better known for his novels, short stories, essays and criticism, and as a translator of Russian literature. He used the pseudonym John Courtney. He also wrote for The Philadelphia Record under the pseudonym "Gorky."
Later in life he married Helen Kestner (1893–1960), who was also an author, under the pseudonym Sybil Norton. However, he is probably best known for his unhappy affair with Dorothy L. Sayers, fictionalized by Sayers in the detective book Strong Poison (1930) and by Cournos himself in The Devil Is an English Gentleman (1932).

Approach to this island should be made with care and with the use of a nautical chart since there are many rocks and shoals in the immediate area. There is a small pebbly beach on the southern side.

[[History of the Second World War]]

CATEGORIES: Series of history books about World War II, United Kingdom in World War II

The History of the Second World War is the official history of Britain's contribution to the Second World War and was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO). This immense project was sub-divided into a number of areas to ease publication. Military operations are covered in the United Kingdom Military Series. There are four other series: the United Kingdom Civil Series covering various aspects of the civilian part of the war effort; the Foreign Policy series; the Intelligence series; and the Medical series. There are also a number of other volumes that do not come under the aegis of the actual series, but were published by HMSO and may usefully be read as adjuncts to it as they cover matters not considered in great detail or in one case at all in the main series. Further volumes, published either after the privatisation of HMSO, or in the separate series about SOE, are also useful.
The volumes were written to be read individually, rather than as a whole series. That inevitably lead to some duplication of coverage in the series, but in their respective introductions to their parts of the series, Sir Keith Hancock and Sir James Butler explain why the decision was taken: to eliminate the need to read more volumes than cover the particular part of the war effort desired to be studied. Hancock edited the Civil Series and Butler the Military. The first volume of the series appeared in 1949, and the last as recently as 1993, with a revised edition of another volume appearing in 2004.
Another somewhat unusual decision for the series was to cover the conflict from a theatre of operations point of view rather than an individual service point of view. This decision was taken to acknowledge the fact that military operations of the era were so joint and so interlinked that to try and separate out each service's contribution would have been futile.
The original works also lack references to unpublished sources when published prior to 1970. In the 1940s, it was not anticipated that government archives would be opened at any time within the foreseeable future. The Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1966 were still in the future. The decision was therefore taken to publish the works with only references to published sources. British constitutional conventions on the anonymity of Government officials and ministers are also followed, leading to a somewhat detached narrative style in some cases.
However, a parallel series of volumes, for official use, were printed, which referenced the unpublished sources; and these references were added in manuscript, in red ink. A few official copies escaped into public libraries and these additions can been seen. The additional sources can also been seen in some of the Hyperwar versions (see External Links).

The Division of Grey is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Sir George Grey, who was Governor of South Australia from 1841–45 (and later Prime Minister of New Zealand). 
The division covers the rural mid-north and north of South Australia, with a size of [tpl]convert|904881|km2|sqmi[/tpl] spanning 92% of the state. The borders of the electorate include the Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales borders, in addition to much of the southern coastal border. The electorate spans to Marion Bay and Eudunda in the south. The main population centres of the electorate include Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Roxby Downs, Coober Pedy, Port Pirie, Kadina, Maitland, Orroroo, Peterborough, Burra and Eudunda.
Grey was held by the Australian Labor Party for much of its history. From 1943 to 1993, Labor held it for all but one term. Since 1993, redistributions (such as the latest inclusion of Yorke Peninsula and the upper east) and the decline of the Labor vote in the mining and pastoral areas (due to the closure of many mining operations) have made it today a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party.

Bonsile John Kani (born 1943, New Brighton, Eastern Cape, South Africa) is a South African actor, director and playwright.
Kani joined The Serpent Players (a group of actors whose first performance was in the former snake pit of the zoo, hence the name) in Port Elizabeth in 1965 and helped to create many plays that went unpublished but were performed to a resounding reception.
These were followed by the more famous Sizwe Banzi is Dead and The Island, co-written with Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona, in the early 1970s. He also received an Olivier Award nomination for his role in My Children My Africa!
Kani's work has been widely performed around the world, including New York, where he and Winston Ntshona won a Tony Award in 1975 for Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island. These two plays were presented in repertory at the Edison Theatre for a total of 52 performances.
Nothing but the Truth (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 Fleur du Cap Awards for best actor and best new South African play. In the same year he was also awarded a special Obie award for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the USA.
Kani is executive trustee of the Market Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the Market Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA.

[[Division of Hindmarsh]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of Australia, Constituencies established in 1903, 1903 establishments in Australia

The Division of Hindmarsh is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the western gulfside suburbs of Adelaide. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was split on 2 October 1903 and is named after Sir John Hindmarsh, who was Governor of South Australia 1836-38.  Before 1949, Hindmarsh included most of what is now Port Adelaide.
The seat has one of the highest proportions of citizens over the age of 65 in Australia. It has long been dominated by working-class families and aged pensioners, but it is now attracting new wealth to its seaside suburbs.   For many years, it was one of the safest Labor seats in the country; it was in Labor hands for all but three years from 1903 to 1993.  However, a 1984 redistribution made it somewhat less safe for Labor, and it became even more marginal when it absorbed most of the seaside suburbs that had previously been in nearby Hawker.   Christine Gallus, the former member for Hawker, followed most of her constituents into Hindmarsh for the 1993 election and became only the second non-Labor MP to win it. She held the seat for 11 years before Steve Georganas regained it for Labor on her 2004 retirement after nearly defeating her in 1998 and 2001.  Georgeanas held the seat until 2013. when Matt Williams became only its third non-Labor member, and the first to oust a Labor incumbent.
The Adelaide Airport is located in the electorate, and noise pollution is a prominent local issue, besides the aged care needs of the relatively elderly population. 
Prominent sitting members have included Norman Makin, who was Speaker in the Scullin Government and a cabinet minister in the Curtin and Chifley governments, and Clyde Cameron, who was a cabinet minister in the Whitlam Government.

[[International Linear Collider]]

CATEGORIES: Particle physics facilities

The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a proposed linear particle accelerator. 
It is planned to have a collision energy of 500 GeV initially, with the possibility for a later upgrade to 1000 GeV (1 TeV). 
The host country for the accelerator has not yet been chosen and proposed locations are Japan, Europe (CERN) and the USA (Fermilab).
Japan is considered the most likely candidate, as the Japanese government is willing to contribute half of the costs, according to the coordinator of study for detectors at the ILC . 
Construction could begin in 2015 or 2016 and will not be completed before 2026.
Studies for an alternative project called CLIC the Compact Linear Collider are also underway, which would operate at higher energies (up to 3 TeV) in a machine with comparable length as the ILC.
The ILC would collide electrons with positrons. It will be between 30 km and 50 km (19–31 mi) long, more than 10 times as long as the 50 GeV Stanford Linear Accelerator, the longest existing linear particle accelerator.  The proposal is based on previous similar proposals from Europe, the U.S., and Japan.

[[Slættaratindur]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of the Faroe Islands

Slættaratindur is the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands, at an altitude of 880 metres.US.fo, Slættaratindur er ikki longur 882 m, men 880 m (Slættaratindur is no longer 882m but 880 metres) It is located in the northern part of Eysturoy, between the villages of Eiði, Gjógv, and Funningur. Funningur lies at the foot of the mountain.
Its name means "flat summit".  It can be climbed in about four hours, and although the routes are steep, technical climbing skills are not necessary to reach the summit.  In clear weather the summit gives views over the entire archipelago.  Slættaratindur is one of ten mountains in the Faroe Islands which rise to over 800m above sea level.  Gráfelli, the second-highest peak at 856 m, lies just to the north-east of Slættaratindur.
According to Guinness World Records Slættaratindur is the object of the world's longest sight line, 550 km from Vatnajökull, the largest glacier in Iceland. GWR state that "owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction, Vatnajökull (2119m), Iceland, can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands, 340 miles (550km) away". This may be based on a claimed sighting of Vatnajökull by a British sailor in 1939, during the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II when they were used to monitor German shipping and U-boat movements. The validity of this record is analysed/undermined in mathematical and atmospheric detail by J.C. Ferranti.Longlines page at viewfinderpanoaramas.org by J.C. de Ferranti

[[Neo-impressionism]]

CATEGORIES: Modern art, Post-Impressionism, Impressionism

Neo-impressionism  is a term coined by French art critic Félix Fénéon in 1886 to describe an art movement founded by Georges Seurat. Seurat’s greatest masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, marked the beginning of this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants (Salon des Indépendants) in Paris.[tpl]cite book | last = Hutton| first = John G. | title = Neo-impressionism and the Search for Solid Ground: Art, Science, and Anarchism in Fin-de-siecle France| publisher= Louisiana State University Press| location= Baton Rouge, Louisiana | year = 2004| isbn = 0-8071-1823-0 [/tpl] Around this time, the peak of France’s modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods. Followers of neo-impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores. Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced neo-impressionists’ characterization of their own contemporary art.
Pointillism technique is often mentioned, because it was the dominant technique in the beginning.

[[Censorinus]]

CATEGORIES: Post–Silver Age Latin writers, Grammarians of Latin, Latin-language writers, 3rd-century writers, Ancient Roman antiquarians

Censorinus was Roman grammarian and miscellaneous writer from the 3rd century AD.
He was the author of a lost work De Accentibus and of an extant treatise De Die Natali, written in 238, and dedicated to his patron Quintus Caerellius as a birthday gift. The contents are of a varied character: the natural history of man, the influence of the stars and genii, music, religious rites, astronomy, the doctrines of the Greek philosophers, and antiquarian subjects.
The second part deals with chronological and mathematical questions, and has been of great service in determining the principal epochs of ancient history. The whole is full of curious and interesting information. The style is clear and concise, although somewhat rhetorical, and the Latinity, for the period, good.
The chief authorities used were Varro and Suetonius. Some scholars, indeed, hold that the entire work is practically an adaptation of the lost Pratum of Suetonius. The fragments of a work De Natali Institutione, dealing with astronomy, geometry, music and versification, and usually printed with the De Die Natali of Censorinus, are not by him. Part of the original manuscript, containing the end of the genuine work, and the title and name of the author of the fragment are lost.

The music is intentionally written to be funny, being liberally sprinkled with obtrusively clumsy, mechanical and over-repetitive composition, together with passages evidently designed to mimic the effects of inaccurate notation and inept performance.

It would have changed the way in which the state apportioned its electoral votes. Rather than assigning all 9 of the state's electors to the candidate with a plurality of popular votes, under the amendment, Colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count, which would be a unique system (Nebraska and Maine assign electoral votes based on vote totals within each congressional district). The amendment did not pass.

The project has noted the need to record the genetic profiles of endogenous populations, as isolated populations are the best way to understand the genetic frequencies that have clues into our distant past. The relationship between such populations allow to infer the humankind journey from the initial humans that left Africa and populated the world. The HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel, is a resource of 1,063 cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 1,050 individuals in 52 world populations, banked at the Foundation Jean Dausset-CEPH in Paris.

Exercise intensity refers to how much energy is expended when exercising. Perceived intensity varies with each individual. It has been found that intensity has an effect on what fuel the body uses and what kind of adaptations the body makes after exercise. Intensity is the amount of physical power (expressed as a percentage of the maximal oxygen consumption) that the body uses when performing an activity. For example, exercise intensity defines how hard the body has to work to walk a mile in 20 minutes.The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports - Publications. (n.d.).

The British-American Project is a fellowship of over 1,000 leaders and opinion formers from a broad spectrum of occupations, backgrounds and political viewpoints, drawn in equal numbers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Project was created to renew and continue the close relationship among leaders of the two countries that was established by an earlier generation during the Second World War; for that reason, it was originally known as the British-American Project for the Successor Generation. The first gathering took place in 1985.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/06/usa.politics1|title=Friends in high places|first=Andy|last=Beckett|date=2008-11-04|publisher=The Guardian[/tpl]
The Project meets annually for a four-day conference on a topic of current concern to both countries: ideas and experiences are exchanged, and friendships developed and strengthened. Each year, 24 new participants are selected from either side of the Atlantic, on the basis of service to their communities and professional achievement, and sponsored to attend the conference as Delegates. At the end of each conference, Delegates are elected Fellows of the Project. Fellows from past years attend the annual conferences at their own expense, with many returning in successive years.

Originally this 46 minute feature contained live-action sequences that ran for 2 minutes at the beginning of the film, and 2 minutes at the end. These live-action sequences featured the park ranger and his two young grandchildren sitting by the fireplace and Christmas tree, and a short montage of mechanical toys, Christmas decorations, and a pet kitten during the opening and closing credits. Since 1992 VHS and DVD releases of this feature have edited out all of the live-action footage, and the opening credit sequence has been re-edited over animation.

The River Frome [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|uː|m[/tpl], historically the River Froom, is a river in South Gloucestershire and Bristol, England.  It is approximately [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] long, rises in Dodington Park, South Gloucestershire, and flows in a south westerly direction through Bristol, joining the former course of the river Avon in Bristol's Floating Harbour. The mean flow at Frenchay is [tpl]convert|60|cuft/s|m3/s[/tpl] The name Frome is shared with several other rivers in South West England and means 'fair, fine, brisk’. The river is familiarly known in east Bristol as the Danny.
Originally the Frome joined the Avon downstream of Bristol Bridge, and formed part of the city defences, but in the thirteenth century the river was diverted through marshland belonging to St Augustine's Abbey (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the lower reaches of the river were culverted and the river now flows under The Centre into St Augustine's Reach.
As with many urban rivers, the Frome has suffered from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and the area around the river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.

Something Is Out There is the title of a 1988 American science fiction television miniseries that aired on NBC, and a short-lived weekly series that followed in the fall of 1988.
The miniseries stars Joseph Cortese as Jack Breslin, a police officer investigating brutal murders in which organs have been removed from the victims. He learns that the crimes are being committed by a monstrous alien insectoid prisoner known as a xenomorph, possessing shape-shifting and physical possession abilities, who has escaped from an alien prison starship passing by the solar system, and he teams up with a beautiful medical officer from that ship, Ta'Ra (Maryam d'Abo), to track the villain down. Ta'Ra has assorted superhuman abilities, including telepathy and superhuman agility, which come in handy during the mission.
The miniseries drew very high ratings for NBC and critics noted the chemistry between Jack and Ta'Ra as one of its high points. One week after its ratings success, Brandon Tartikoff announced it would become a weekly series. 13 episodes were ordered.  Something Is Out There fared poorly opposite the very successful Dallas and the show was later moved to compete with Beauty and the Beast where ratings only worsened.Starlog, Issue #140, interview with Marc Shapiro  The series was canceled after only six one-hour episodes were broadcast, with two additional episodes produced but not broadcast at the time.
Due to its short run, the series is not often found in syndication, but the Sci-Fi Channel did include it as part of a rotation of short-lived series, including broadcasting the previously unaired episodes. An edited down version of the miniseries has aired as a syndicated television movie.

A flak jacket or flak vest is a form of body armor designed to provide protection from case fragments ("frag") from high explosive weaponry, such as anti-aircraft artillery ("flak" a German contraction for Flugzeugabwehrkanone), grenades, some round shot used in shotguns and land mines and other lower-velocity projectiles. It is not designed to protect against bullets fired from small-arms such as rifles or handguns.  However, certain flak jackets are able to sustain certain gunshots, dependent on the armor, the gun, and the distance that the bullet has travelled.
The term "flak jacket" is often colloquially applied to newer body armor featuring protection against small arms projectiles, but the original usage predated the existence of functional bulletproof vests and the two are not interchangeable in performance.

Snuff Mills is a park in the Stapleton area of north Bristol, also known as Whitwood Mill.
There are pleasant walks along the steep wooded banks of the River Frome, for example to Oldbury Court. The park was purchased in 1926 by the Corporation of Bristol as "a pleasure walk for citizens of Bristol" and restored in the 1980s by the Fishponds Local History Society.
The park's name originates from one of the millers. His nickname was 'Snuffy Jack' because his smock was always covered in snuff.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.4092 |title= Snuff Mills Park, Bristol |accessdate=2007-03-13 |format= |work=English Heritage [/tpl]
The park includes an old quarry and a stone mill. The old mill within the park was used for cutting and crushing stone from the many quarries along the Frome Valley during the late 19th century. It contains a waterwheel, egg-ended boiler in its setting and the remains of a vertical steam engine. Despite the name, tobacco snuff was never ground in this mill.

[[Bell (crater)]]
CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Bell is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just past the western limb. It lies in an area of terrain that is marked by many small craters, a number of which are satellite craters of Bell listed in the table below. Bell lies within two crater diameters of Laue to the north, and to the west of the smaller Helberg.
The outer wall of Bell has been worn, eroded, and somewhat reshaped by subsequent impacts. The satellite crater Bell Q lies across the southwest rim, and smaller craters lie across the rim to the north and the east. The interior floor is relatively level, and marked by the crater Bell E which is offset to the east of the midpoint.

Adolf Dymsza (born Adolf Bagiński; 1900–1975) was a very popular and remarkable Polish comedy actor of both the pre-World War II and post-war eras. He starred in both theatre and film productions, mainly before World War II. He and Kazimierz Krukowski performed as the very popular duo Lopek and Florek in kleynkunst productions at Qui Pro Quo and other noted Warsaw cabarets. Another pseudonym was "Dodek."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ7hxz5PpYY Biographical notes He was arguably the most popular Polish comic actor of the 1930s,[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Berghahn Books | isbn = 978-1-57181-948-2 | last = Mazierska | first = Ewa |author2= Elżbieta Ostrowska | title = Women in Polish cinema | date = March 2006 | page=59 [/tpl] Andrzej Wajda remarked once, that for him Dymsza was a symbol of pre-war Polish cinema in general.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Wallflower Press | isbn = 978-1-903364-89-5 | last = Orr | first = John |author2= Elżbieta Ostrowska | title = The cinema of Andrzej Wajda: the art of irony and defiance | year = 2003 | page=XII [/tpl]
Dymsza was born Adolf Bagiński on 7 April 1900 in Warsaw, then in Russian Empire, to Adolf Sr. and Matylda née Połądkiewicz. At the age of 15 he worked as a busboy in some of Warsaw's cabarets. He graduated from a local II Gymnasium and then studied at the Hipolit Wawelberg's Trade School. During World War I and the subsequent Polish-Bolshevik War he started his career as a dancer in cabarets and theatres of Warsaw, Minsk and Grodno. He returned to Warsaw after the war, but no theatre would hire him and he spend several years giving dance lessons and occasionally singing in cabarets. It is speculated that he might have appeared in a number of silent films in that period, none of them survive to our times however. 
His debut came in 1925, when he was hired by the famous Qui Pro Quo cabaret as a singer and dancer,[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book | publisher = Mercury House | last = Nowicki | first = Ron | title = Warsaw: the cabaret years | year = 1992 | pages = 70–81[/tpl] "immediately conquering the audience with his natural juvenile wit and temperamental performances of Warsaw street types." He remained part of Qui Pro Quo's crew until 1931, appearing on stage along such stars of contemporary Polish cabaret and cinema as Marian Hemar, Eugeniusz Bodo, Hanka Ordonówna, Mieczysław Fogg, Mira Zimińska, Zula Pogorzelska and Fryderyk Jarosy. 
Initially rarely seen on screen, Dymsza first made a name for himself as an excellent comedian in Warsaw's cabarets in the 1920s.[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal | author = |date=May 1958 | title =Polish cinema | journal =Polish perspectives | volume =1 | issue = | page =81 | issn =0032-2962 | url = | publisher = Polski Instytut Spraw Międzynarodowych [/tpl] In 1930 he starred in the first of his films: the Wiatr od morza and Niebezpieczny romans.

After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland, Dymsza ignored the Polish actors' boycott and worked in the Nazi-administered cabarets of Warsaw.
 "Yet, after 1945 when Second World War was over, his disloyal attitude to the patriotic attitude was quickly forgotten by Polish fans of his talent. Perhaps, need to laugh again was strong enough in the society so deeply traumatised by the atrocities of war, and Dymsza's talent in evoking happy-go-lucky air of the past Warsaw street was highly desirable. Also, rather proletaryan style of his roles was a helpful circumstance in revival of his career in a postwar communist Poland. After few years of being banned from public performing in Warsaw, in 1951 Dymsza was back on stage of the Warsaw comedy theatre "Syrena" and in the movies." 
In 1958 he toured USA and Canada with Kabaret Wagabunda.[tpl]pl[/tpl] [tpl]cite journal|journal=Przekrój|date=February 1959|issue=724[/tpl]
Late in his years he retired to a care house in Góra Kalwaria, where he died on 20 August 1975. He is buried at Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery.

Berlage is an old lunar crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The smaller crater Bellinsgauzen is attached to its northern rim, and Cabannes is less than one crater diameter to the northwest. To the east-northeast of Berlage is Lemaître.
This formation is unusual for the high density of small impact craters that lie across the interior and along the rim, especially in the northern half. The crater is heavily eroded, and the original features have been worn down with the passage of time. A combination of three small craters lie across the northern rim, at the eastern edge of the rim where Berlage is joined to Bellinsgauzen.

Ellison is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon from the Earth. It is located just beyond the northwest limb of the Moon, to the southwest of the large walled plain Poczobutt. Due west of Ellison is the crater Coulomb.
The outer rim of Ellison is roughly circular, with an inward protrusion along the southern rim and a slight outward bulge to the wet-northwest. It has a single terrace on the northeastern inner wall, formed from the slumping of material. Instead of a central peak, there is a small crater located at the midpoint. A smaller crater is located just to the west-southwest of this centrally-located formation, but the flat interior floor is otherwise devoid of features of interest.

Dunfermline Palace is a former Scottish royal palace in Dunfermline, Fife. It is currently a ruin under the care of Historic Scotland and an important tourist attraction in Dunfermline. 
Dunfermline was a favourite residence of many Scottish monarchs. Documented history of royal residence there begins in the 11th century with Malcolm III who made it his capital. His seat was the nearby Malcolm's Tower, a few hundred yards to the west of the later palace. In the medieval period David II and James I of Scotland were both born at Dunfermline. 
Dunfermline Palace is attached to the historic Dunfermline Abbey, occupying a site between the abbey and deep gorge to the south. It is connected to the former monastic residential quarters of the abbey via a gatehouse above a pend (or yett), one of Dunfermline's medieval gates. The building therefore occupies what was originally the guest house of the abbey. However, its remains largely reflect the form in which the building was developed by James IV in a refabrication around 1500. Throughout the sixteenth century, Scotland's monarchs and royal family members were frequently in residence. 
In 1589 the palace was given as a wedding present by the king, James VI, to Anne of Denmark after their marriage. She gave birth to three of their children there; Elizabeth (1596), Charles (1600) and Robert (1602). 
After the Union of Crowns in 1603, the removal of the Scottish court to London meant that the building came to be rarely visited by a monarch. Ten tapestries from the royal tapestry collection were still there in 1616, left from the time the infant Prince Charles resided at the Palace.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 10, 521. When Charles I returned in 1633 for his Scottish coronation he only made a brief visit to his place of birth. The last monarch to occupy the palace was Charles II who stayed at Dunfermline in 1650 just before the Battle of Pitreavie. Soon afterwards, during the Cromwellian occupation of Scotland, the building was abandoned and by 1708 it had been unroofed. 
All that remains of the palace today is the kitchen, its cellars, and the impressive south wall with a commanding prospect over the Firth of Forth to the south.

[[Rowland (crater)]]
CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Rowland is a large lunar crater that is located in the northern part of the Moon, on the far side from the Earth. This is an old, worn formation that is overlain by a number of smaller craters. The most notable of these is Rowland Y, which is attached to the inner wall along the north-northwestern rim. Additional smaller craters are attached to the inner wall along the southeastern and south-southwestern rims, the latter being designated Rowland N. Rowland C forms a double crater with a smaller, bowl-shaped formation in the eastern part of the floor.
The outer wall of Rowland has been rounded by a long history of minor impacts, leaving the edge somewhat irregular and rough. The top of the rim has been worn down until it became almost level with the surrounding terrain, making this a circular depression in the surface. The remains of a terrace can still be discerned in places, particularly along the eastern and southeastern inner wall.
Attached to the exterior of the eastern rim is the huge walled plain Birkhoff, an even older and more worn formation. Due north of Rowland, within one crater diameter, is Sommerfeld. To the west-southwest is the smaller crater Chappell.

This is a relatively young formation with features that have not received a significant amount of wear or erosion from subsequent impacts. The edge of the rim is sharply defined, and the inner wall is terraced along the northwestern side. The interior floor is relatively level, with a double-peak formation at the midpoint.

John Brown (c.1810 – 1876) also known by his slave name, "Fed", was a slave in Virginia. 
Born in Virginia to slave parents Joe and Nancy, Fed grew up under the care of his mother along with his three brothers and two sisters, and remembered seeing his father Joe only once when he was allowed to see their family. Fed was told by Joe that his grandfather was a member of the Igbo people from Nigeria and captured by slave traders in the 18th century.Fradin (2000), p. 12 He moved at the age of ten to North Carolina, where he was separated from his mother. He was moved to Georgia and worked for some years on a cotton farm in Milledgeville under harsh conditions. After several attempts, Brown finally managed to escape and moved around the country and the world, eventually sailing to England in 1850 where he worked as a carpenter in London. He contacted the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and in 1855 he dictated the book Slave Life in Georgia: A Narrative of the Life, Sufferings, and Escape of John Brown, a Fugitive Slave, Now in England to the society's secretary, Louis Alexis Chamerovzow. This is one of the many descriptions of slave's life in the south known as "slave narratives."
Brown married a local woman and remained in London until his death, earning a living as a herbalist. He died in London in 1876.

[[Maore dialect]]
CATEGORIES: Languages of Comoros, Mahoran culture, Swahili

Maore Comorian, or Shimaore (French Mahorais), is one of the two indigenous languages spoken in the French-ruled Comorian islands of Mayotte; Shimaore being a dialect of the Comorian language, while ShiBushi is an unrelated Malayo-Polynesian language originally from Madagascar.  Historically, Shimaore- and ShiBushi-speaking villages on Mayotte have been clearly identified, but Shimaore tends to be the de facto indigenous lingua franca in everyday life, because of the larger Shimaore-speaking population.  Only Shimaore is represented on the local television news program by RFO.  The 2002 census references 80,140 speakers of Shimaore in Mayotte itself, to which one would have to add people living outside the island, mostly in metropolitan France.  There are also 20,000 speakers of Comorian in Madagascar, of which 3,000 are Shimaore speakers.
The same 2002 census indicates that 37,840 persons responded as knowing how to read or write Shimaore.  However this number has to be taken with caution, since until a few years ago Shimaore did not have a standard writing system.
From a sociolinguistic perspective, French tends to be regarded by many Shimaore speakers as the language of higher education and prestige, and there is a temptation by native Mahorans to provide an all-French education to their children.  This puts a lot of pressure on Shimaore and the language may become endangered in the near future if nothing is done.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Although French remains the official language in Mayotte, Shimaore will probably be taught in Mahoran schools starting in the next few years, and a pilot project began in fall 2004.  As in many parts of France where local languages are introduced in the school system, this has led to tensions between partisans of a French-centered education system and administrations, versus those promoting a more diversified approach.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]  Shimaore's position in this regard is however different from other French regions (such as Brittany), since the language is locally spoken by a majority of the population.  The project in Mayotte has been inspired by similar projects involving Swahili in eastern Africa countries.
Mayotte is a geographically small territory, but frequent exchanges between villages have not started until the last quarter of the twentieth century.  As of 2004, linguistic differences between the east and west part of the island, and between the main city of Mamoudzou and the remote villages, are still noticeable, especially when it comes to phonological differences.  One typical example is the word u-la (to eat), notably pronounced this way in the city due to the influence of a brand of yogurt bearing the same name, but pronounced u-dja in other parts of the island.

[[British Rail MPV]]

CATEGORIES: British Rail diesel multiple units, Non-passenger multiple units, British Rail Departmental Units

The Multiple-purpose Vehicle or MPV is a purpose-built departmental derivative of a diesel multiple unit. Twenty-five two-car units were ordered by Railtrack to enable it to replace its varied collection of ageing departmental vehicles, many of which were converted from redundant passenger stock.
The vehicles were built in Germany by Windhoff. The design is based on the Windhoff "CargoSprinter" units that are operated by Deutsche Bahn (Germany) and CRT Group (Australia).  Normally a unit consists of one powered vehicle fitted with twin [tpl]convert|265|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] Railpac diesel engines, semi-permanently coupled to an unpowered slave unit without engines (effectively a driving van trailer).  The later orders for the South East of England and for overhead line replacement are instead composed of two powered units, to give better acceleration and top speed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cargosprinter.com/d/wh/akt/pre/061.htm|title=New on-track plant|work=Rail Infrastructure No. 15|first=Roger|last=Butcher|date=May 2000[/tpl]  When first built there were problems with the vehicles being 'out of gauge' when running empty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
The concept of the design is that each vehicle has a driving cab and an under floor engine/transmission with Multiple unit (MU) control. The majority of each vehicle is a flat load bed that can carry combinations of 10-foot and 20-foot modules that are secured using the locking system for ISO standard containers. Modules can be changed as required to suit current requirements.
The use of standard container mountings led to suggestions[tpl]By whom|date=May 2009[/tpl] that "Freight Multiple Units" could be introduced. In 2005, two powered MPV units were used for freight trials by coupling standard freight wagons between in between the pairs. Temporary multiple unit control cables were run along the wagons in order to connect the two MPVs, which are acting as locomotives working as a push-pull train.

[[John Burke (spy)]]

John Burke (1830 – January 18, 1871) was a Confederate adjutant general of Texas and spy. He was born in Pennsylvania. He was left an orphan by age 11 and eventually he made his way to Texas. There he studied law at night and was a cobbler by day. He joined the Confederacy and was a member of the famous Hood's Brigade briefly until he became scout. He served early in the war as a scout for P.G.T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston and J.E.B. Stuart during the Valley campaign of 1862. He rode with J. E. B. Stuart around McClellan's army in 1862. Burke traveled behind Union lines as far as New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. He used disguises, frequently the uniform of a Union officer, and would change the color of his artificial eye. He was able to provide Lee with valuable information about Union forces and dispositions. His most daring adventure came after he was apprehended in Philadelphia. He was placed under guard, in irons and handcuffs. As the train to Washington crossed a high trestle, he jumped into the river and made his way back to Lee. Fatigued by his exertions and now a colonel, Burke resigned and accepted appointment by Governor Murrah as adjutant general of Texas, effective November 1, 1864. General Lee wrote a letter thanking him for his services. Unfortunately, records of the adjutant general's office were lost in the Capitol fire of 1881, and little of Burke's service in that assignment is known.
At the end of the war he joined Murrah in his flight to Mexico. After Murrah died, Burke returned to Marshall and resumed his law practice. He married Jennie Taylor in 1865, and they had two sons and a daughter. His most famous case at the bar was his defense of prisoners held at Jefferson in the Stockade Case in 1869. Burke died at Jefferson on January 18, 1871, and is buried there.

This crater is generally circular in form, with a slight outward bulge along the western rim. The outer rampart of ejecta spills over slightly into the Apollo basin floor, but the remainder of the rim lies in rugged irregular ground. At the midpoint is a central peak formation with a pair of tiny craters to either side: east and southwest. The remaining floor is relatively flat to the north and somewhat more irregular to the south.

[[Sport Aid]]

CATEGORIES: Charity fundraisers, 1986 in sports

Sport Aid (also known as Sports Aid) was a charitable event held on May 25 1986, raising $37m to support famine relief in Africa, and is the sporting event with the most participants in history.
The event was organised by Chris Long (Chairman and Founder), Bob Geldof (Band Aid), Simon Dring (UNICEF consultant) and John Anderson PhD (Head of Global Special Events, UNICEF). Paul Willies (Fundraising Consultant) was the initial coordinator for the events in North America, writing the manual for the 10k road race and contributed to bringing in UNICEF as the overall underwriter of the project. Sport Aid was supported by Band Aid (Bob Geldof) and UNICEF. The event took place in 89 countries simultaneously. Sport Aid raised funds for Band aid and UNICEF. 
At 15:00 GMT on Sunday May 25 1986, 19.8 million runners around the world ran, jogged or walked 10 kilometers with sponsorship's or donations given to support African famine relief charities.
274 cities held official events to allow over 19.8 million participants to follow designated courses with television coverage shown worldwide. London saw 200,000 runners complete the course, Barcelona hosted 50,000, Athens 30,000, Santiago 15,000, Dublin 20,000, Port of Spain 15,000, Melbourne 10,000 and countless millions of further runners set out at the same time to run around their local village or park, or simply to take part in this global event. In the United States New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and San Francisco participated (along with several other Running Clubs in smaller towns) - with New York being the key race. The events in the United States were not widely publicized due in part to its clash with Hands Across America. Sport Aid was scheduled to take place on the eve of a UN special session on Africa, and so the timing conflict with Hands Across America could not be avoided.
A central event was the lighting of a symbolic torch at the United Nations by Omar Khalifa, a champion Sudanese 1500m runner to signal the start the 10K races around the world. Mr. Khalifa began his journey to the United Nations on May 16, when he lit a torch from the embers of fire in El Moweilih relief camp in the Sudan. He was then flown to Athens where the torch of Africa and the Olympic torch were symbolically joined. This was the first time the Olympic torch had been lit outside of an Olympic Games. He then ran through 12 European capitals, being greeted by leaders like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, President Mitterrand, Chancellor Kohl and Pope John Paul II.
The New York Times reported, “With 200,000 Londoners setting the pace, more than 20 million runners in 76 countries ran today in Sport Aid, a global benefit to raise money for the starving of Africa. Today, Sport Aid is still the biggest sporting event ever organized".
A charity single was released to publicize and raise money for the event, Tears for Fears song Everybody Wants to Run the World.

Gasherbrum is a remote group of peaks located at the northeastern end of the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram range of the Himalaya on the border of the Chinese-administered Shaksgam Valley and the Gilgit-Baltistan territory controlled by Pakistan, both of which are disputed according to the UN. The massif contains three of the world's 8,000 metre peaks (if one includes Broad Peak). Gasherbrum is often claimed to mean "Shining Wall", presumably a reference to the highly visible face of Gasherbrum IV; but in fact it comes from "rgasha" (beautiful) + "brum" (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means "beautiful mountain".
In 1856, Thomas George Montgomerie, a British Royal Engineers lieutenant and a member of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India, sighted a group of high peaks in the Karakoram from more than 200 km away. He named five of these peaks K1, K2, K3, K4 and K5 where the K denotes Karakoram. Today, K1 is known as Masherbrum, K3 as Broad Peak, K4 as Gasherbrum II and K5 as Gasherbrum I. Only K2, the second highest mountain in the world, has kept Montgomerie's name.

[[East Isles, Minneapolis]]

CATEGORIES: Neighborhoods in Minneapolis, Minnesota

 

East Isles is a neighborhood within the larger Calhoun-Isles community in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.  It lies between Hennepin Avenue to the east, Lake of the Isles to the west, West Lake Street to the south, and West 22nd Street to the north.  Together with parts of Lowry Hill East and other nearby neighborhoods, East Isles is part of the larger, but unofficial, Uptown neighborhood.
Architects William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie designed the Catherine Gray House in this neighborhood, at 2409 Lake of the Isles Boulevard; it is currently owned by Brian and Mary Longe.  Purcell built the Catherine Gray House (his first project) for his grandmother, who funded the project to help Purcell and Elmslie launch their new firm.  Purcell lived in the house with his grandmother until he married his wife Edna.   After many years of alterations and lots of white paint, the house had lost most of its Prairie School characteristics.  After an extensive historical restoration to the exterior in 2005-2006 by the Longes, the exterior of the home has been returned to its original beauty and is a fine example of early Prairie School in Minneapolis.
Behind the Catherine Gray House, on Lake Place, is another significant project by Purcell & Elmslie - the Purcell-Cutts House.  The Purcell-Cutts House was originally called the Edna Purcell House, named for his wife. Purcell and his wife lived in this home and raised their two sons there.  The Cutts family bought the house years later and lived there for many years, and then donated the home to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  The home is now a museum and is open to the public for tours.  Signs denoting the neighborhood incorporate that window designs of this house.

[[Daily Sketch]]

The Daily Sketch was a British national tabloid newspaper, founded in Manchester in 1909 by Sir Edward Hulton.

It was bought in 1920 by Lord Rothermere's Daily Mirror Newspapers but in 1925 Rothermere offloaded it to William and Gomer Berry (later Viscount Camrose and Viscount Kemsley). 
It was owned by a subsidiary of the Berrys' Allied Newspapers from 1928Dennis Griffiths (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1492-1992, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p.187 (renamed Kemsley Newspapers in 1937 when Camrose withdrew to concentrate his efforts on the Daily Telegraph). In 1946 it was merged with the Daily Graphic. In 1952 Kemsley decided to sell the paper to Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail, who promptly revived the Daily Sketch name in 1953. The paper struggled through the 1950s and 1960s, never managing to compete successfully with the Daily Mirror, and in 1971 it was closed and merged with the Daily Mail.[tpl]cite web|title=11 May 1971: Britain's oldest tabloid closes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/11/newsid_2860000/2860297.stm|accessdate=23 August 2013|publisher=BBC[/tpl] 
The Sketch was Conservative in its politics and populist in its tone during its existence through all its changes of ownership. In some ways much of the more populist element of today's Daily Mail was inherited from the Sketch: before the merger, the more serious Mail, then and for a long time afterwards a broadsheet, was also right-wing. The Sketch notably launched a moral panic over Daniel Farson's 1960 television documentary Living for Kicks, a portrait of British teenage life at the time, which led to a war of words between the Sketch and the Daily Mirror. It also participated in the press campaign against the screening of the BBC film The War Game.Press articles discussing The War Game on director Peter Watkin's Website, retrieved 2012-06-23.

[[St Donat's Castle]]

CATEGORIES: Castles in the Vale of Glamorgan, Arts centres in Wales, Reportedly haunted locations in Wales, United World Colleges

St Donat's Castle is a medieval castle in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, overlooking the Bristol Channel in the village of St Donat's near Llantwit Major, and about 25 km west of Cardiff. Since 1962 the castle has housed the international Sixth form college Atlantic College.
The castle lies on an elevation to the east of a small valley opening to the sea between precipitous sea cliffs to both east and west. 
An inner court about 40 m across within a polygonal inner curtain wall is closely surrounded by an outer court and curtain wall with a dry moat facing the eastern approach. The curtain walls date from c. 1300, having been built by the first Stradling (or perhaps by his widow's second husband). The outer wall mostly survives and has a small original tower entirely contained with it on the north, and a square gatehouse on the east. The inner court is entered by an arch on the east side beside the rectangular Mansell Tower (an enlargement of the original keep).  The north-western range is of the early 16th century; the north-eastern range is of the late 15th century; the late-15th-century great hall is on the south side of the court. thumbnail|The Watch Tower, by St Donat's Castle in 1777
Beside it, squeezed in between the inner and outer curtain walls, is the Bradenstoke Hall, consisting of the inner curtain wall on the north side, the somewhat realigned outer curtain wall on the south, with a modern wall on the east end built at the point so that an early-14th-century roof (brought from Bradenstoke Abbey in Wiltshire) would fit. The western range has largely been replaced by a much larger, three-storey building (which necessitated, when erected, the demolition of the western part of the outer curtain wall). Its ground floor is a large modern dining hall with a very fine 15th-century roof, probably Flemish in origin but imported from Boston Stump Church (Lincolnshire). The Lady Anne Tower on the south-western corner of the castle has been rebuilt many times.

[[Political groups of the European Parliament]]

CATEGORIES: European Parliament party groups

The political groups of the European Parliament are the parliamentary groups of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is unique among supranational assemblies in that its members (MEPs) organise themselves in such ideological groups like in traditional national legislatures. Instead, the members of other supranational assemblies form national groups. The political groups of the European Parliament are sometimes the formal representation of a European political party ("Europarty") in the Parliament. In other cases, they are political coalitions of a number of European parties, national parties, and independent politicians.
These groups are not parties, but looser coalitions. They are strictly forbidden to campaign during the European elections since this is the exclusive responsibility of the Europarties. Each political group is assumed to have a set of core principles, and political groups that cannot demonstrate this may be disbanded (see below).

Good to Be Alive is the most famous song from the DJ Rap album Learning Curve and is also featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 movie Go. Its heavy, plodding bass beat and flowing lyrics make it stand out from DJ Rap's typical fast-paced drum and bass style. Because of the noticeable difference between the album version and the radio remix of the song (the album version was slower and deeper, while the radio remix was more of an upbeat club song), two different music videos were released. The album version (directed by David Slade) featured DJ Rap in a futuristic sci-fi setting with people trapped in red capsules (like in the Matrix movies). The radio remix version (directed by Jeff Richter) featured DJ Rap mixing and dancing in a club environment.

CATEGORIES: Visitor attractions in Douglas County, Kansas, Visitor attractions in Franklin County, Kansas, Heritage railroads in Kansas

The Midland Railway is a heritage railroad headquartered in Baldwin City, Kansas.
It was chartered in 1982 to find an abandoned railroad line to operate. Midland purchased the line from Baldwin City to Ottawa, Kansas from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1987, and began running excursion trains on part of the line later that year. Total length of the line is 11 miles (17.7 km).
Midland operates a demonstration historic railroad, and its mission is to "educate the public about the role railroading played, and continues to play, in the commercial, social, and cultural life of America's Heartland." Midland's base of operations is the depot built in 1906 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at 1515 High Street in Baldwin City. This building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Midland has received two matching federal grants to rebuild track. Private grants have and are being used to rebuild railroad equipment. Starting in 2004, excursion trains are run all the way from Baldwin City to Ottawa.
The regular operating season runs from Memorial Day (last Monday of May) to October 31 (Halloween). Special events and fairs are held at various times through the year. Weekend Boy Scout camps are held in the spring and fall. Midland's Scout program is one of the few in the country to offer a railroading merit badge.

The Groans of the Britons ([tpl]lang-la|gemitus Britannorum[/tpl]In full Agitio ter consuli gemitus Britannorum) is the name of the final appeal made by the Britons to the Roman military for assistance against barbarian invasion. The appeal is first referenced in Gildas' 6th-century De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae; Gildas' account was later repeated in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. According to Gildas, the message was addressed to the general Flavius Aetius and requested his aid in defending formerly Roman Britain from the Picts and Scots. The collapsing Western Roman Empire had few military resources to spare during the period referred to as the Decline of the Roman Empire and the record is ambiguous on what the response to the appeal was, if any. According to Gildas and various later medieval sources, the failure of the Roman armies to secure Britain led the Britons to invite Anglo-Saxon mercenaries to the island, precipitating the Anglo-Saxon invasion.

Patria Onoguria, referred to as such by Agathius, Priscus Rhetor, Zacharias Rhetor, and Pseudo-Zecharias Rhetor, was a Hunno-Bulgar state around the Sea of Azov granted by Byzantium to the Onogurs in the 460s AD when, led by Attila's sons Dengizich and Ernakh, they overran Karadach's Akatziroi already settled in the region within the larger context of the Great Migrations and the Turkic expansion. From the 5th to 8th century this was the kingdom of the Hunugur/Onogur/Unogur Crimean Huns, a horde of equestrian nomads in the North Eurasian steppe east of the Don River (Russia) who became known as Utigur Bulgars under Sandilch after they were annexed by the Onoq.
According to the Rhetors, the Hunugurs/Onogurs/Unogurs crossed the Volga and entered into Europe around the year 463 having been attacked (along with the Saragur and Ugor) by the Sabirs who in turn had been attacked by the Uar.

The LGV Nord is a French 333-kilometre-long high-speed rail line, opened in 1993, that connects Paris to the Belgian border and the Channel Tunnel via Lille.
With a maximum speed of 300 kilometres per hour, the line appreciably shortened rail journeys between Paris and Lille. Its extensions to the north (Belgium, the Channel Tunnel) and the south (via the LGV Interconnexion Est) have reduced journey times to Great Britain and Benelux and for inter-regional trips between the Nord (Pas de Calais) region and the southeast and southwest of France.
Its route is twinned with the A1 for 130 kilometres. As it is mostly built in flat areas, the maximum incline is 25 metres per kilometre (2.5%).
Of all French high-speed lines the LGV Nord certainly sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock: the TGV Sud-Est, TGV Réseau, TGV Atlantique, TGV Duplex, Eurostar, Thalys PBA and PBKA as well as the local trains. Traffic is controlled by the Lille rail traffic centre.

[[Jerry Clower]]

Howard Gerald "Jerry" Clower (September 28, 1926 – August 24, 1998) was a popular country comedian best known for his stories of the rural South.  He was often nicknamed "The Mouth of Mississippi".
Clower was born in Liberty, Mississippi, and began a 2-year stint in the Navy immediately after graduating high school in 1944. Upon his discharge, in 1946, he was a Radioman Third Class (RMN3) and had earned the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with two bronze service stars), and the World War II Victory Medal.  He then studied agriculture at Mississippi State University, where he played college football and was a member of Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity. After finishing school, in 1951, Clower worked as a county agent and later as a seed salesman. He became a fertilizer salesman for Mississippi Chemical in 1954. By this time, he had developed a reputation for telling funny stories to boost his sales.
Eventually, tapes of Clower's speaking engagements wound up in the hands of Edwin "Big Ed" Wilkes and Bud Andrews in Lubbock, Texas, who had him make a better quality recording which they promoted. MCA Records later awarded "The Coon Hunt" a platinum album for sales in excess of $1 million at the retail level.KDAV DJ, Bud Andrews
At first, Clower took orders at his speaking engagements, selling 8000 copies on the Lemon record label. In time, Wilkes sent a copy to Grant Turner at WSM radio in Nashville, and when Turner played it on the air, Clower said "that thing busted loose". MCA was soon knocking on Clower's door offering him a contract. Once MCA began distribution in 1971, Jerry Clower from Yazoo City, Mississippi Talkin’ retailed more than a million dollars over ten months and stayed in the Top 20 on the country charts for 30 weeks.AllMusic, Jerry Clower Biography
Clower made 27 full-length recordings in his 27-year career as a professional entertainer (not counting "best of" compilations). With one exception, all the recordings were released by MCA. The exception was Ain't God Good which Clower recorded with MCA's blessing at a worship service. Word Records promoted and distributed this title in 1977. Always a staunch Christian, this recording gave Clower an opportunity to present his personal testimony in a comfortable church setting.
Clower's stories often feature the Ledbetters, the quintessential Southern, agrarian clan which includes from story to story various combinations of Uncle Versie, Aunt Pet, Ardel, Burnel, Raynel, W.L., Lanel, Odell, Eudel, Marcel, Claude, Newgene, and Clovis.
In 1973, Clower became a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and remained with that organization until his death. He also co-hosted a radio show called Country Crossroads with Bill Mack and Leroy Van Dyke which has aired in syndication for 40 years and a television version of the program was produced as well starting in 1993. Clower's involvement began in 1973 and lasted well over 20 years. This show was produced and distributed by the Southern Baptist Convention. Clower was also very visible as a commercial spokesman. While it was mostly confined to local commercials and those airing in the southern states, Clower could be seen selling anything from Dodge cars and trucks to transmission repairs and oil service to barbecue and fishing and hunting equipment. In fact, his salesmanship was so strong that he was named Pitchman of the Year for his commercials for flying fishing lures in 1995. An illustration of this type of propeller bait appears on his album released that year.
Clower also taped segments of Nashville On the Road which included comedic performances and interviews with other country artists featured on the show. Jim Ed Brown hosted the series with Clower during the program's first season, 1975–1976, and they were joined by Helen Cornelius in 1976. Their involvement in the series lasted until 1981. The show continued to air with new host, Jim Stafford, through 1983.
Clower's last album was Peaches and Possums, released posthumously in October 1998.
He was the author of four books. The book Ain't God Good became the basis for an inspirational documentary film of the same title that won an award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. His other three books include 1978's Let the Hammer Down; 1987's Life Everlaughter, and 1993's Stories From Home.
Clower died following heart bypass surgery, aged 71. He had been married to Homerline Wells Clower since August 1947. He was also survived by a son, Ray (1953-2011), three daughters, Amy, Sue, and Katy, and seven grandchildren.

[[Elafius]]

Elafius was a British figure of the fifth century AD.
During a visit to Britain by Germanus of Auxerre in c. AD 446-7 he met with Elafius and miraculously cured his crippled son. This act served to demonstrate to the Britons that Catholicism was the true faith rather than Pelagianism. 
Elafius is mentioned as being regionis illius primus' or 'leader of that region' in chapters 26 and 27 of Constantius of Lyon's hagiography of Germanus and also in Chapter XXI of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England. Both sources mention that provincia tota or 'the whole province' followed him to witness the cure. This description is taken to mean that Elafius was one of a number of local warlords rather than leader of all post-Roman Britain and provides a small insight into the political situation in the area at the time. By means of comparison, a Briton Germanus is recorded as having met seventeen years earlier, in 429, is described by Constantius as being of tribunician rank. This remnant Roman term and the Romanised society it represents may therefore have been abandoned by Elafius' time as he is accorded no such title.
Elafius' court may have been at Winchester, the former Roman city of Venta Belgarum or at St Albans, the former Roman city of Verulamium, although this is speculation. If Elafius was a leader he may have played a role in the subsequent exile of the Pelagian preachers although this banishment is described as being decided through common consent rather than a warlord's orders or even a Roman legal process.

Predictor@home was a distributed computing project that used BOINC.
It was established by The Scripps Research Institute to predict protein structure from protein sequence in the context of the 6th biannual CASP, or Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. A major goal of the project was the testing and evaluating of new algorithms to predict both known and unknown protein structures.
The project was most recently run by the University of Michigan.
Predictor@home was complementary to Folding@home.
Whereas the latter aims to study the dynamics of protein folding, Predictor@home aimed to specify what the final tertiary structure will be. Also, the two projects differ significantly in the infrastructure they use. Predictor@home used BOINC, whereas Folding@home maintains its own software completely outside of BOINC.
However, for a time, Predictor@home competed with other BOINC protein structure prediction projects, such as Rosetta@home. Each uses different methods of rapidly and reliably predicting the final tertiary structure.
Predictor@home is currently inactive.

The first mention of the river in historical chronicles is connected with a disastrous Battle on the river Nemiga, which took place here in 1067, when the forces of the prince of Kievan Rus' defeated the forces of Polatsk princedom. The medieval epic The Tale of Igor's Campaign refers to the "bloody river banks of Nyamiha."
Lines from the famous epic detail the gruesome battle: 
''On the Nemiga the spread sheaves are heads,
the flails that threshare of steel,
lives are laid out on the threshing floor,
souls are winnowed from bodies.
Nemiga’s gory banks are not sowed
goodly-sown with the bones of Russia’s sons.''[tpl]cite web|title=Nyamiha it is vanished river|url=http://mynativebelarus.blogspot.com/2012/11/nyamiha-it-is-vanished-river.html|accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] 
For a long time it was the second largest river flowing through Minsk, until it was adapted for its urban location by containment within a network of pipes. One part of the river was put into a pipe in 1926, and the rest in 1955. Today the river is a minor feature of the city environment, and the name Nyamiha more commonly refers to a nearby street.
Nyamiha (or Nemiga) Street is part of a shopping district famous for its amber craftwork. The Nyamiha  metro station on the street was the site a of tragedy on May 30, 1999.
Another incident on Nyamiha Street occurred on July 25, 2004, when a two-hour downpour in Minsk caused the storm sewers to overflow. Nyamiha Street and environs were flooded.

The Standards and Privileges Committee of the United Kingdom House of Commons was established in 1995 to replace the earlier Committee of Privileges. Ten Members of Parliament sit to make recommendations to the House on complaints of breach of Parliamentary privilege. It was itself replaced on 7 January 2013, when it was split into the Committee on Standards and the Committee of Privileges.[tpl]Cite web |title = Standards Committee |url = http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/standards/ |publisher = parliament.uk |accessdate = 5 April 2014 [/tpl]
The Committee was appointed by the House of Commons to oversee the work of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. It examined the arrangements for the compilation, maintenance and accessibility of the Register of Members' Interests and considered specific complaints made in relation to the registering or declaring of interests and any matter relating to the conduct of Members, including specific complaints in relation to alleged breaches in the Code of Conduct which were drawn to the Committee's attention by the Commissioner.
On 9 December 2010 Geoff Hoon along with Stephen Byers and Richard Caborn were banned from entering the Parliamentary estate; the Committee banned Geoff Hoon for five years as his was the most serious breach, whilst Byers received two years and Caborn six months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Geoff-Hoon-Stephen-Byers-And-Geoff-Hoon-Could-All-Be-Banned-From-Houses-Of-Parliament/Article/201012215850598?lpos=Politics_Second_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_15850598_Geoff_Hoon,_Stephen_Byers_And_Geoff_Hoon_Could_All_Be_Banned_From_Houses_Of_Parliament|title=Three Former MPs Face Parliamentary Ban[/tpl] This was due to the 2010 Cash for Influence Scandal

The Green Berets is a 1968 American war film featuring John Wayne, George Takei, David Janssen, Jim Hutton and Aldo Ray, nominally based on the eponymous 1965 book by Robin Moore, though the screenplay has little relation to the book.
Thematically, The Green Berets is strongly anti-communist and pro-Saigon. It was produced in 1968, at the height of American involvement in the Vietnam War, the same year as the Tet offensive against the largest cities in South Vietnam. John Wayne was prompted by the anti-war atmosphere and social discontent in the U.S. to make this film in countering that. He requested and obtained full military co-operation and matériel from President Johnson. To please the Pentagon who were attempting to prosecute Robin Moore for revealing classified information, Wayne bought Moore out for $35,000 and 5 percent of undefined profits of the film.Moore, Robin Introduction to 1999 edition The Green Berets The Green Berets: The Amazing Story of the U.S. Army's Elite Special Forces Unit 2007 Skyhorse Publishing Inc.

[[Pisco Sour]]

CATEGORIES: Cocktails with brandy or cognac, Sour cocktails, Pisco, Peruvian alcoholic beverages, Cocktails with bitters, American inventions

A Pisco Sour is a cocktail typical of South American cuisine.[tpl]efn-ua|Despite the Pisco Sour being predominantly emblematic along the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile, Casey calls it a "classic South American drink" and Bovis says it is "a hallmark South American cocktail."[tpl]sfn|Casey|2009|p=89[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Bovis|2012|p="Pisco Sour"[/tpl][/tpl] The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian Pisco Sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds Key lime (or lemon) juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.
The cocktail originated in Lima, Peru, and was invented by Victor Vaughen Morris, an American bartender, in the early 1920s. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The Pisco Sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.
In Chile, historian Oreste Plath attributed the invention of the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. The original source cited by Plath attributed the invention of the whiskey sour to Stubb, not the Pisco Sour. The oldest known mentions of the Pisco Sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.
Chile and Peru both claim the Pisco Sour as their national drink, and each asserts exclusive ownership of both pisco and the cocktail. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the Pisco Sour are distinct in both production and taste. Thus, the Pisco Sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture.

[[47th (1/2nd London) Division]]
CATEGORIES: Divisions of the United Kingdom in World War I, Infantry divisions of the United Kingdom, Military units and formations in London

The British 47th (1/2nd London) Division was a first-line Territorial Force division.  Originally called the "2nd London Division" it was designated the 47th Division in 1915 and referred to as the "1/2nd London Division" after the raising of the second-line 60th (2/2nd London) Division.  The division was sent to France in March 1915, one of the first Territorial divisions to enter the fighting, and served on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War.
In 1916 the division was part of Wilson's IV Corps. Wilson was not impressed by Charles Barter, GOC 47th division, and at the end of March 1916 he and Monro (GOC First Army) discussed getting rid of him, but could not come up with a reason for doing so; Barter survived until he was relieved during the Battle of the Somme.Jeffery 2006, pp. 156–8
47th Division conducted effective mining operations against Vimy Ridge on 3 May and 15 May 1916, but a German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line, and the Division performed badly during a counterattack on 23 May. The Division conducted a carefully planned single battalion raid on the night of 27–8 June, claiming to have killed 300–600 Germans for only 13 British casualties.Jeffery 2006, pp. 161–4, 168–70
In the final stages of the war the division's GSO1 (effectively chief of staff) was acting Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Montgomery, then in his very early thirties and later a leading British commander in the Second World War.
The division fought in the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Battle of Festubert, the Battle of Loos, the 1 July 1916 Battle of the Somme (1916), including the Battle of Flers-Courcelette and the capture of High Wood. After mid-1916 battles included the Battle of Le Transloy, the Battle of Messines, and the Battle of Cambrai (1917).
During the Second World War, the division was once again raised. Initially as the 2nd London Division, but was redesignated in November 1940 as the 47th (London) Infantry Division.

Springs is part of the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality, which includes much of the East Rand.
Springs was divided during the Apartheid era into the middle- and upper-income white suburbs around the city centre, the Indian area of Bakerton east of the CBD, while blacks were relocated to KwaThema,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saweb.co.za/townships/township/gauteng/kwathema.html|title=KwaThema History|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl] southwest of the CBD.

La Linea ("The Line") is an Italian animated series created by the Italian cartoonist Osvaldo Cavandoli. The series consists of 90 episodes, each about 2–3 minutes long, which were originally broadcast on the Italian channel RAI between 1971 and 1986. Over the years the series aired in more than 40 countries around the world. All episodes of the series are available today on DVD.
Due to its short duration (usually 2 minutes 30 seconds), it has often been used in many networks as an interstitial program.
The tune played in the background of the series was created by Franco Godi.
Even though the episodes are numbered up to 225, there are, in fact, only 90 La Linea episodes. The 1971 series had 8 (4 min) episodes, the 1978 series had 56 (101-156), and the 1986 series had 26 (200-225).

African-American history is the portion of American history that specifically discusses the African-American or Black American ethnic groups in the United States. Most African Americans are the descendants of captive Africans held in the United States (or territories that would become the United States) from 1619 to 1865. Blacks from the Caribbean whose ancestors immigrated, or who immigrated to the U.S., also traditionally have been considered African-American, as they share a common history of predominantly West African or Central African roots, the Middle Passage and slavery.
It is these peoples, who in the past were referred to and self-identified collectively as the American Negro, who now generally consider themselves African Americans. Their history is celebrated and highlighted annually in the United States during February, designated as Black History Month, and it is their history that is the focus of this article.
Others who sometimes are referred to as African Americans, and who may self-identify as such in US government censuses, include relatively recent Black immigrants from Africa, South America and elsewhere who self-identify as being of African descent.

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of Australia, Constituencies established in 1949, 1949 establishments in Australia

The Division of Kingston is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the far-south portion of the Adelaide metropolitan area. The division was first proclaimed in 1949.
The division is named after Charles Kingston, Premier of South Australia (1893-1899), elected to the first House of Representatives in 1901 and the first Federal member of the Division of Adelaide in 1903. The Liberals and Labor have both alternated for long spells in the seat. It has tended to elect an MP from the governing party of the day, having elected only four opposition MPs. Notably, every sitting member in the electorate's history has been defeated at the polls—none have retired or resigned.[tpl]cite news|first=Ian|last=Munro|title=Labor incumbent looks safe in see-saw seat|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-election/labor-incumbent-looks-safe-in-seesaw-seat-20100725-10qlg.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 July 2010|accessdate=4 January 2011[/tpl]  
Kingston has been represented by Labor MP Amanda Rishworth since the 2007 election. Going into the 2010 election, it was the most marginal Labor seat in South Australia. However, Rishworth technically made it a safe Labor seat by winning 64 percent of the two-party vote. 
The redistribution before the 2013 election removed Kingston's rural areas with the transfer of around 6,500 voters in McLaren Vale and Willunga to Mayo, increasing Labor's margin by half a percent. This substantially reduced the area covered by the electorate, down from 377 to 171 square kilometres, almost the same as 2001 boundaries. The previous larger boundaries were used from 2010 to 2004 and 1998 to 1993. Boundaries from 1990 to 1984 were similar to the current but without the southern coastal strip.
At the election Rishworth won 59.7 percent of the two-party vote and is still the second-safest Labor seat in South Australia.

Sometimes, a crisis can be triggered by transitions experienced in these years, such as andropause or menopause, the death of parents or other causes of grief, unemployment or underemployment, realizing that a job or career is hated but not knowing how else to earn an equivalent living, or children leaving home. People may reassess their achievements in terms of their dreams. The result may be a desire to make significant changes in core aspects of day-to-day life or situation, such as in career, work-life balance, marriage,  romantic relationships, large expenditures, or physical appearance.

The Division of Blair is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The division was created in 1998 and is named after Harold Blair, an Aboriginal singer and civil rights campaigner. The Division is based in the rural areas west of Brisbane and includes parts of Ipswich and the Scenic Rim and Lockyer Valley regions. 
The founder of One Nation, Pauline Hanson, contested Blair in 1998, shifting from her previous seat, Oxley. To get rid of Hanson, Liberal and Labor preferenced each other, allowing Liberal challenger Cameron Thompson to win on the eighth count.
Thompson held the seat without serious difficulty in the next two elections, and it was widely considered as a safe Liberal seat. In the 2006 redistribution, the 2004 Liberal margin of 11.2% was reduced to 5.7%, as Esk, Nanango and Kingaroy were removed and more of Ipswich and Boonah were added. Blair had been rated as having received more funding promises from the Howard Government than any other electorate in the country.[tpl]cite news|title=Australia Votes 2007 - Blair|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/guide/blai.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] In the 2007 election, Thompson was defeated by Labor challenger Shayne Neumann, with a 10.2 percent swing to Labor.

CATEGORIES: Rail technologies

Hillclimbing is a problem faced by railway systems when a load must be carried up an incline. While railways have a great ability to haul very heavy loads, this advantage is only significant when the tracks are fairly level. As soon as the gradients stiffen, the tonnage that can be hauled is greatly diminished.

[[Gospel in Islam]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic texts

Injil ([tpl]lang-ar-at|إنجيل|ʾInjīl[/tpl], alternate spelling: Ingil ) is the Arabic name for what Muslims believe to be the original Gospel of Jesus (Isa). This Injil is one of the four Islamic holy books the Quran records as revealed by God, the others being the Zabur (possibly the Psalms), the Tawrat (the Torah), and the Quran. The word Injil is derived from the Greek word [tpl]lang|grc|Εὐαγγέλιον[/tpl] (euangelion)Muhammad in world scriptures Abdul Haque Vidyarthi - 1997 "It is derived from the Greek term evangelion which means gospel, good news and happy tidings. But in the New Testament it has nowhere been given the name of any book." or in Aramaic ܐܘܢܓܠܝܘܢ (awongaleeyoon)Peshitta (Mark 1:1) - "Literal Aramaic idiomatic (Lit. Ar. id.) name: "Awon-galee-yoon," or He Reveals." which means "good news" (Old English gōdspel; the term injil is also used by Christian Arabs for their gospels; e.g. Gospel of John, ([tpl]lang-ar|إنجيل يوحنا[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|DIN|ʾInǧīl Yūḥannā [/tpl]) as well as Indonesian Christians; e.g. Injil Yohanes). Muslims believe this original Gospel to have been altered over time, and the teachings of Jesus lost and replaced with false teachings, often believed to be at the instigation of Paul the Apostle. Muslims believe that the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and lost Gospels, such as that of Peter, contain fragments of Jesus' message, but that the majority of the original teaching has been altered or lost.

[[African-American culture]]

CATEGORIES: African-American culture, Cultural appropriation, History of hip hop

African-American culture, also known as black culture, in the United States refers to the cultural contributions of African Americans to the culture of the United States, either as part of or distinct from American culture. The distinct identity of African-American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the Middle Passage. The culture is both distinct and enormously influential to American culture as a whole.
African-American culture is rooted in Africa. It is a blend of chiefly sub-Saharan African and Sahelean cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of Americans of African descent to practice their cultural traditions, many practices, values, and beliefs survived and over time have modified or blended with white culture and other cultures such as that of Native Americans. There are some facets of African-American culture that were accentuated by the slavery period. The result is a unique and dynamic culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on mainstream American culture, as well as the culture of the broader world.
Elaborate rituals and ceremonies were a significant part of African Culture. West Africans believed that spirits dwelled in their surrounding nature. From this disposition, they treated their surroundings with mindful care. Africans also believed spiritual life source existed after death. They believed that ancestors in this spiritual realm could then mediate between the supreme creator and the living. Honor and prayer was displayed to these " ancient ones", the spirit of those past. West Africans also believed in spiritual possession.Clayborn Carson, Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary B. Nash, The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans, Vol 1 to 1877 ( Prentice Hall, 2012) p.18
In the beginning of the eighteenth century Islam began to spread across North Africa; this shift in religion began displacing traditional African spiritual practices. The enslaved Africans brought this complex religious dynamic within their culture to America. This fusion of traditional African beliefs with Christianity provided a common place for those practicing religion in Africa and America.
After emancipation, unique African-American traditions continued to flourish, as distinctive traditions or radical innovations in music, art, literature, religion, cuisine, and other fields. 20th-century sociologists, such as Gunnar Myrdal, believed that African Americans had lost most cultural ties with Africa.[tpl]cite journal |last=James |first=Jessica S. |title=What Neighborhood Poverty Studies Can Learn from African American Studies |date=June 2008 |journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=26 |url=http://www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no4/2.4_What_Neighborhood_Poverty_Studies_Can_Learn_from_African_American_Studies.pdf |format=PDF [/tpl] But, anthropological field research by Melville Herskovits and others demonstrated that there has been a continuum of African traditions among Africans of the Diaspora.[tpl]cite book|last=Herskovits|first=Melville|others=Sidney Mintz|title=The Myth of the Negro Past|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1990|isbn=0-8070-0905-9|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/framedreprint/222/1/226|page=368[/tpl] The greatest influence of African cultural practices on European culture is found below the Mason-Dixon line in the American South.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/gullah/04.htm|title=The Gullah: Rice, Slavery, and the Sierra Leone Connection|last=Opala|first=Joseph|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciway.net/afam/culture.html|title=South Carolina – African American Culture, Heritage|publisher=South Carolina Information Highway|accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]
For many years African-American culture developed separately from European-American culture, both because of slavery and the persistence of racial discrimination in America, as well as African-American slave descendants' desire to create and maintain their own traditions. Today, African-American culture has become a significant part of American culture and yet, at the same time, remains a distinct cultural body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/black_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=23 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080507214116/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/black_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=23 |archivedate=2008-05-07 |title=African American Voices: Slave Culture |publisher=University of Houston |date=2007-06-02 |accessdate=2007-06-02[/tpl]

Aarnio studied at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki, and started his own office in 1962. The following year, he introduced his Ball Chair, a hollow sphere on a stand, open on one side to allow a person to sit within. The similar Bubble Chair was clear and suspended from above. Other innovative designs included his floating Pastil Chair (similar to a solid inner tube),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=171907 |title=A10905 Armchair, 'Pastilli', moulded fibreglass reinforced polyester, designed by Eero Aarnio, made by Asko Finnternational, Finland, 1968 - Powerhouse Museum Collection |publisher=Powerhousemuseum.com |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] and Tomato Chair (more stable with a seat between three spheres). His Screw Table, as the name suggests, had the appearance of a flat head screw driven into the ground. He was awarded the American Industrial Design award in 1968.

Robert "Bob" Paisley OBE (23 January 1919 – 14 February 1996) was an English footballer and manager who spent almost fifty years with Liverpool as a wing half, physiotherapist, coach and manager. His achievements as Liverpool manager have led to Paisley being widely regarded as one of the greatest football managers of all time, and he remains to date the only manager in football history to have won three European Cups.
Paisley came from a small Durham mining community and, in his youth, played for Bishop Auckland before he signed for Liverpool in 1939. During the Second World War, he served in the British Army and could not make his Liverpool debut until 1946. In the 1946–47 season, he was a member of the Liverpool team that won the First Division title for the first time in 24 years. In 1951, he was made club captain and remained with Liverpool until he retired from playing in 1954.
He stayed with Liverpool and took on two roles as reserve team coach and club physiotherapist. By this time, Liverpool had been relegated to the Second Division and their facilities were in decline. In December 1959, Bill Shankly was appointed Liverpool manager and he promoted Paisley to work alongside him as his assistant in a management/coaching team that included Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett. Under their leadership, the fortunes of Liverpool turned around dramatically and, in the 1961–62 season, the team gained promotion back to the First Division. Paisley filled an important role as tactician under Shankly's leadership and the team won numerous honours during the next twelve seasons.
In 1974, Shankly retired as manager and, despite Paisley's own initial reluctance, he was appointed as Shankly's successor. He went on to lead Liverpool through a period of unprecedented domestic and European dominance, winning twenty major honours in nine seasons: six League Championships, three League Cups, six Charity Shields, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup and one UEFA Super Cup. He also won the Manager of the Year Award a record six times. He retired from management in 1983 and was succeeded by Joe Fagan. He died in 1996, aged 77, after suffering from Alzheimer's Disease for several years.

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of Australia, Constituencies established in 1949, 1949 establishments in Australia, Federal politics in Queensland

The Division of Bowman is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The division was created in 1949 and is named for David Bowman, an early leader of the Australian Labor Party, in Queensland. The seat is located in the eastern suburbs of Brisbane, and includes the suburbs of Capalaba, Cleveland, Redland Bay, Birkdale, Thorneside, Alexandra Hills, Thornlands, Mount Cotton, Cornubia, Ormiston, Wellington Point and Victoria Point. The division also incorporates various islands of Moreton Bay including Coochiemudlo Island, the inhabited southern Bay Islands (Russell, Karragarra, Macleay and Lamb) and the big tourist destination of North Stradbroke Island.
It is generally a residential electorate with some crops, poultry, various light industries and tourism.
Bowman has traditionally been a highly marginal seat, regularly changing hands between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party. Notably, the electorate has been won by the party with the largest national two party preferred vote at every election from 1954 to 2001 (except 1990). However, in the 2004 election, an energetic campaign by Dr Andrew Laming, and an electoral redistribution (due to the creation of the new Division of Bonner), saw Bowman returned to the Liberal Party by a significant margin (59.12% two party preferred) and the division was then considered by pollsters such as Antony Green to be a fairly safe Liberal seat.
In the 2007 election the electorate experienced a strong swing of 8.86% towards the Australian Labor Party. Incumbent Liberal MP Andrew Laming held the seat by 0.04%, or 64 votes. Following the 2007 election, it was second only to McEwen as the most marginal seat in the country, although the 2009 electoral redistribution in Queensland saw the margin notionally reduced even further to effectively 0.005%, making Bowman the most marginal seat in the country.Hurst, Brian: Time is running out in ALP in Bowman, Bayside Bulletin, 1 February 2010.

[[Isabella piercing]]

CATEGORIES: Female genital piercings

Isabella piercing is a female genital piercing. This extremely deep clitoral shaft piercing starts below the clitoris and just above the urethra, and then goes up through the clitoral shaft and exits at the top of the hood.[tpl]cite book |first=Victoria|last=Pitts-Talyor| title = Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body | publisher =Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2008|pages=233–234|accessdate = March 22, 2014| isbn = 0313341451 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=66u24WAyO_YC&pg=PA233&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y7AtU-bBJsTr2QWb04GoBg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]
The Isabella piercing was first documented in issue 17 of Piercing World Magazine. As an Isabella piercing intersects the shaft of the clitoris, it is considered to be high risk for nerve damage and is therefore extremely rare. Like other female genital piercings, the Isabella piercing is anatomy-dependent. Nerve damage can result from piercing a clitoris that is too small or from piercing through the shaft of the clitoris and through the dorsal nerve. Piercing through the shaft of the clitoris can also result in excessive bleeding and blood loss to the clitoris. Healing time is 2-3 months. The Nefertiti piercing was invented in response to the inherent dangers involved with the Isabella piercing.

[[Winkelried]]
CATEGORIES: Swiss families, Medieval Switzerland

Winkelried was a family of Unterwalden, recorded as members of the lower nobility during the second half of the 13th century and as commoners during the 14th to early 16th centuries.
The name is mostly associated with Arnold von Winkelried, the hero of the Battle of Sempach (1386) in Swiss historiography.
Because of the importance of Arnold Winkelried in 19th-century Swiss nationalism, much research has gone into the genealogy of this family.
Their origin was presumably  in the territory of Ennetmoos in Nidwalden, where a toponym  Wichried (Wychried, [tpl]coord|46.953|N|8.340|E|[/tpl]) has survived into modern times.
The first recorded member of this family was the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested in a letter dated to the 1240s.
Heinrich von Winkelried was probably a son of Rudolf, als recorded as a knight and ministerialis of count Rudolf von Habsburg, between 1275 and 1303. 
Heinrich became connected him with a legend of a dragon fight, first recorded by Etterlin (1507).
Abbot Rudolf I of Engelberg who lived during the same period may also have been a member of the family.
After Heinrich, the Winkelrieds lose their distinction as noblemen. People bearing the name Winkelried are recorded as mostly prosperous commoners during the 14th and 15th centuries. These later Winkelrieds may reflect their origin among the nobility by keeping a coat of arms (displaying a crescent in a triangle). A Jacob von Winkelried is recorded in 1343 as owning property in Ennetmoos, in 1372 a Peter Winkelried is the tenant of the possessions of Engelberg in Alpnach. 
In the 1382 uprising against the noble families in Unterwalden, the Winkelrieds seem to be affected because of their close connections to the aristocracy.
In a document dated 1 May 1367, one of the witnesses signs as Erni Winkelried. This is the only candidate on record for the historicity of Arnold Winkelried of patriotic legend. The first mention of Winkelried as the hero of Sempach dates to nearly a century later, in the time of the Burgundian Wars.
But a man called Erni Winkelried is recorded again on 29 September 1389 and on 13 March 1396, after the battle where he supposedly died a hero's death. But yet another Erni Winkelried appears in 1417 and 1418 as amtmann of Nidwalden, so that there was clearly more than one person with this name, perhaps father and son. 
Yet another Arnold Winkelried is recorded in the second half of the 15th century, in connection of a lawsuit of November 1474 and as delegate of Nidwalden at the Swiss Diet on several occasiosn during 1476 to 1482.
A Heinrich Winkelried recorded from 1456 was a member of the council of Nidwalden from before 1471 and delegate at the Diet during 1469 to 1498.
A fourth Arnold Winkelried is recorded as delegate from  1496 to  1507.
He was also a member of a Swiss delegation sent to emperor Maximilian in 1508 and as a captain in the battle of Novara in 1513.
This Arnold is last recorded in 1524.
Yet another Arnold Winkelried, sometimes conflated with the aforementioned, was a notorious mercenary leader  during the first quarter of the 16th century. He was knighted in 1514 by the Milanese duke Maximilian Sforza.
On 13 September he was instigated by cardinal Schiner to engage in a skirmish with the French men-at-arms outside of Milano, thus causing the disastrous Battle of Marignano. In 1516 he marched against Milano in the Service of Maximilian, and defended Verona against the French.
After the treaty of May 1517, Winkelried threatened to declare war on the king of France (who now also was the duke of Milan) privately because of the unpaid wages still owed by Sforza, the previous duke. 
After this dispute had been settled to his satisfaction, he entered French service in 1518 and participated in the 1521 campaign in Picardy in the rank of captain. In 1522, he commanded 16,000 Swiss mercenaries in French service invading  Lombardy. 
At Bicocca he met with is former commander Georg von Frundsberg, who served on the imperial side.
The two mercenary leaders engaged in single combat, and Winkelried was killed. It was later disputed among the Swiss serving on either side whether Winkelried had been killed by Frundsberg or whether he had been shot from the flank.
Because the death of this Arnold Winkelried immediately predates the earliest printed references to the legendary hero of Sempach, some historians have suggested that the chroniclers of the early 16th century named the previously unnamed hero after the mercenary leader.so Charles Oman in ''A History of the Art of War in the Sixteenth Century' (1937).
A son of Arnold's, Hans Winkelired, died before 1532, and the name seems to have been extinct by 1550.

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Nigella damascena (love-in-a-mist, ragged lady[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Ragged+lady | title=Ragged lady | publisher=The Free Dictionary | accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl]) is an annual garden flowering plant, belonging to the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. 
It is native to southern Europe (but adventive in more northern countries of Europe), north Africa and southwest Asia, where it is found on neglected, damp patches of land. 
The specific epithet damascena relates to Damascus in Syria.[tpl]cite book|last=Harrison|first=Lorraine|title=RHS Latin for gardeners|year=2012|publisher=Mitchell Beazley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9781845337315|pages=224[/tpl] The plant's common name comes from the flower being nestled in a ring of multifid, lacy bracts. It is also sometimes called devil-in-the-bush.
It grows to [tpl]convert|20|-|50|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall, with pinnately divided, thread-like,  alternate leaves. The flowers, blooming in early summer, are most commonly different shades of blue, but can be white, pink, or pale purple, with 5 to 25 sepals. The actual petals are located at the base of the stamens and are minute and clawed. The sepals are the only colored part of the perianth. The four to five carpels of the compound pistil have each an erect style. 
The fruit is a large and inflated capsule, growing from a compound ovary, and is  composed of several united follicles, each containing numerous seeds. This is rather exceptional for a member of the buttercup family. The capsule becomes brown in late summer. The plant self-seeds, growing on the same spot year after year.

[[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]
CATEGORIES: 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Atlantic hurricane seasons, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history, shattering numerous records. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913 deaths and record damage of about $159.2 billion. Of the storms that made landfall, five of the season's seven major hurricanes—Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma—were responsible for most of the destruction. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán and the US states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, and Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the United States' Gulf Coast, where a 30 ft (10 m) storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that inundated New Orleans, Louisiana and destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline; and in Guatemala, where Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides.
The 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic than the West Pacific; on average, the latter experiences 26 while the Atlantic only averages 12. This event was repeated in the 2010 season; however, the 2010 typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year, while the 2005 typhoon season featured near average activity.
The season officially began on June 1, 2005, and lasted until November 30, although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category 5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category 5 storms were hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, respectively the costliest and the most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record. This year was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six Greek letter names had to be used.

The Kreutzer Sonata ([tpl]lang-ru|Крейцерова соната[/tpl], Kreitzerova Sonata) is a novella by Leo Tolstoy, named after Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata. The novella was published in 1889 and promptly censored by the Russian authorities. The work is an argument for the ideal of sexual abstinence and an in-depth first-person description of jealous rage. The main character, Pozdnyshev, relates the events leading up to his killing his wife; in his analysis, the root cause for the deed were the "animal excesses" and "swinish connection" governing the relation between the sexes.

Charles Ernest Garforth VC (23 October 1891 – 1 July 1973) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
Garforth was 22 years old, and a corporal in the 15th (The King's) Hussars, British Army during the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC.
On 23 August 1914 at Harmingnies, France, Corporal Garforth volunteered to cut wire under fire, which enabled his squadron to escape. On 2 September when under constant fire, he extricated a sergeant who was lying under his dead horse, and carried him to safety. The next day, when another sergeant had lost his horse in a similar way, Corporal Garforth drew off the enemy fire and enabled the sergeant to get away.
He was taken prisoner in October 1914 and was repatriated in November 1918. He later achieved the rank of sergeant. His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London.
Upon his death, Garforth was cremated, and no monument or headstone was laid, as he technically had no grave. This was rectified on 30 August 2008, when a headstone was dedicated to him at Wilford Hill Cemetery in Nottingham, where his ashes were originally scattered.*BBC NewsMemorial

The Pennsylvania Railroad's K4s 4-6-2 "Pacific" (425 built 1914–1928, PRR Altoona, Baldwin) was their premier passenger-hauling steam locomotive from 1914 through the end of steam on the PRR in 1957.  
Attempts were made to replace the K4s, including the K5 and the T1 duplex locomotive, but none was really successful, and the K4s hauled the vast majority of express passenger trains until replaced by diesel locomotives.  The K4s was not powerful enough for the heavier trains it often pulled from the mid-1930s onward, so they were often double or even triple headed.  This was effective, but expensive-- several crews were needed.  The PRR did have the extra locomotives, many having been displaced by electrification.
It is recognized as the State Steam Locomotive of Pennsylvania. On December 18, 1987, Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey signed into law House Bill No. 1211 naming the PRR K4 as the “official” state locomotive, according that title to both K4 survivors, 1361 and 3750.

Psychological Review is a scientific journal that publishes articles on psychological theory. It was founded by Princeton University psychologist James Mark Baldwin and Columbia University psychologist James McKeen Cattell in 1894 as a publication vehicle for psychologists not connected with the Clark laboratory of G. Stanley Hall (who often published in Hall's American Journal of Psychology). Psychological Review soon became the most prominent and influential psychology journal in North America, publishing important articles by William James, John Dewey, James Rowland Angell, and many others.
In the early years of the 20th century, Baldwin purchased Cattell's interest in the journal, but was forced to sell the journal to Howard Warren in 1908 when scandal  forced him out of his professorship at Johns Hopkins (where he had moved in 1903). Editorship of the journal fell to Baldwin's newly hired young colleague John B. Watson, who used the journal to advance his school of behaviorism. Psychological Review was eventually sold by Warren to the American Psychological Association who has owned it ever since.
Psychological Review's mission has changed somewhat over the decades. Originally it was a journal of general psychology. With the rise of a wide variety of other psychology journals, it gradually came to focus on psychological theory.
According to its website,
 
 Psychological Review publishes articles that make important theoretical contributions to any area of scientific psychology. Preference is given to papers that advance theory, but systematic evaluation of alternative theories in a given domain will also be considered for publication. Papers devoted to surveys of the literature, problems of method and design, or reports of empirical findings are not appropriate.[tpl]cite web |date=July 30, 2012 | url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/rev/index.aspx |title=Psychological Review|publisher=American Psychological Association |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl]

Aba is made up many villages such as; Umuokpoji Aba, Eziukwu-Aba, Obuda-Aba, Aba Ukwu and other villages from Ohazu merged due to administrative convenience. Aba was established by the Ngwa clan of Igbo People of Nigeria as a market town and then later a military post was placed there by the British colonial administration in 1901. It lies along the west bank of the Aba River, and is at the intersection of roads leading to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Umuahia, Ikot Ekpene, and Ikot Abasi.Hoiberg, Dale H.

The Age of Intelligent Machines is a non-fiction book about artificial intelligence by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. This was his first book and the Association of American Publishers named it the Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990.[tpl]cite journal|last=Colin|first=Johnson|title=Era of Smart People is Dawning|journal=Electronic Engineering Times|date=1998-12-28[/tpl] It was reviewed in The New York Times and The Christian Science Monitor.  The format is a combination of monograph and anthology with contributed essays by artificial intelligence experts such as Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, and Marvin Minsky.[tpl]sfn|Kurzweil|1990[/tpl]
Kurzweil surveys the philosophical, mathematical and technological roots of artificial intelligence, starting with the assumption that a sufficiently advanced computer program could exhibit human-level intelligence. Kurzweil argues the creation of humans through evolution suggests that humans should be able to build something more intelligent than themselves. He believes pattern recognition, as demonstrated by vision, and knowledge representation, as seen in language, are two key components of intelligence. Kurzweil details how quickly computers are advancing in each domain.
Driven by the exponential improvements in computer power, Kurzweil believes artificial intelligence will be possible and then commonplace. He explains how it will impact all areas of people's lives, including work, education, medicine, and warfare. As computers acquire human level faculties Kurzweil says people will be challenged to figure out what it really means to be human.

Penyberth was a farmhouse at Penrhos, on the Llŷn Peninsula near Pwllheli, Gwynedd, which had been the home to generations of patrons of poets,  and also a way-station for pilgrims to Bardsey Island,  but destroyed in 1936 in order to build a training camp and aerodrome for the RAF.
Welsh nationalism was ignited in 1936 when the UK government settled on establishing the RAF Penrhos bombing school at Penyberth on the Llŷn peninsula in Gwynedd. The events surrounding the protest, known as Tân yn Llŷn (Fire in Llŷn), helped define Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru.John Davies, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, ISBN 0-14-014581-8, Page 593 The UK government settled on Llŷn as the site for its new bombing school after similar locations Northumberland and Dorset were met with protests.Davies, op cit, page 592 
However,  UK Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin refused to hear the case against the bombing school in Wales, despite a deputation representing half a million Welsh protesters.Davies, op cit, page 592 Protest against the bombing school was summed up by Saunders Lewis when he wrote that the UK government was intent upon turning one of the 'essential homes of Welsh culture, idiom, and literature' into a place for promoting a barbaric method of warfare.Davies, op cit, page 592 Construction of the bombing school building began exactly 400 years after the first Act of Union annexing Wales into England.Davies, op cit, page 592 
On 8 September 1936,  three Plaid Cymru members, dramatist and lecturer Saunders Lewis, poet and preacher Lewis Valentine and novelist DJ Williams, set fire to the bombing school and then went to give themselves up at Pwllheli police station, in accordance with Gandhian principles.  Legend has it that they then spent the evening discussing poetry with the duty sergeant.  Davies, op cit, page 592 The trial at Caernarfon failed to agree on a verdict and the case was sent to the Old Bailey in London. The "Three" were sentenced to nine months imprisonment in Wormwood Scrubs, and on their release they were greeted as heroes by fifteen thousand Welsh at a pavilion in Caernarfon.Davies, op cit, page 592
Many Welsh were angered by the judge's scornful treatment of the Welsh language, by the decision to move the trial to London, and by the decision of University College, Swansea, to dismiss Lewis from his post before he had been found guilty.Davies, op cit, page 593 Dafydd Glyn Jones wrote of the fire that it was "the first time in five centuries that Wales struck back at England with a measure of violence... To the Welsh people, who had long ceased to believe that they had it in them, it was a profound shock."Davies, op cit, page 593
This incident is known in the Welsh language as Llosgi'r ysgol fomio (The bombing school burning) or Tân yn Llŷn (Fire in Llŷn), and has attained iconic status in Welsh nationalist circles.

CATEGORIES: Block ciphers

In cryptography, FROG is a block cipher authored by 
Georgoudis, Leroux and Chaves. The algorithm can work with any block size between 8 and 128 bytes, and supports key sizes between 5 and 125 bytes. The algorithm consists of 8 rounds and has a very complicated key schedule. 
It was submitted in 1998 by TecApro, a Costa Rican software company, to the AES competition as a candidate to become the Advanced Encryption Standard. Wagner et al. (1999) found a number of weak key classes for FROG. Other problems included very slow key setup and relatively slow encryption. FROG was not selected as a finalist.

[[Same-sex marriage in California]]
CATEGORIES: LGBT rights in California, Same-sex marriage in the United States by state

Same-sex marriages are legal in the U.S. state of California. The state first began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 16, 2008, as the result of the Supreme Court of California ruling in In re Marriage Cases, which found that barring same-sex couples from marriage violated the state's constitution. The issuance of those licenses was halted during the period of November 5, 2008 through June 27, 2013 (though existing same-sex marriages continued to be valid) due to the passage of Proposition 8—a state constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Misc/votebymail.htm|title=Election Results - November 4, 2008 - California Secretary of State|accessdate=December 4, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723190051/http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Misc/votebymail.htm |archivedate = July 23, 2008[/tpl] The granting of same-sex marriages recommenced following the United States Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, which restored the effect of a federal district court ruling that overturned Proposition 8 as unconstitutional.
On August 4, 2010, United States District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker declared Proposition 8 a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, a decision upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 7, 2012. The case, known as Perry v.

[[One vote, one value]]
CATEGORIES: Democracy

In Australia, one vote, one value is a democratic principle widely valued in Australia and applied in electoral laws governing redistributions of electoral divisions of the House of Representatives whereby the divisions have the same number of enrolled voters, within a specified percentage of variance. The electoral laws of the Commonwealth for the House of Representatives and all states follows the principle with some exceptions.
For the House of Representatives, the present maximum variance (tolerance) is 10% above or below the mean when districts are first drawn, or 3.5% half way through the expected life of the map.COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL ACT 1918, section 73(4) 
While all states (other than Tasmania) historically had some form of malapportionment, electoral reform in recent decades resulted in an electoral legislation and policy framework based on "one vote one value". However, in the Western Australian and Queensland Legislative Assemblies, seats covering areas greater than [tpl]convert|100000|km2|sqmi|-2[/tpl] may be drawn with fewer electors than the general tolerance would allow.http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/ea1907103/s16g.html/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ea1992103/s45.html/

Carlo Ancelotti ([tpl]IPA-it|ˈkarlo antʃeˈlɔtti[/tpl]; born 10 June 1959) is an Italian football manager and former player who currently manages Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid.
Nicknamed Carletto, Ancelotti played as a midfielder and had a successful career with Roma – captaining the team – with whom he won one Scudetto and four Coppa Italia honours and was part of the legendary late 1980s Milan team with which he won two Scudetti and two European Cups in a five-year period. He was capped 26 times and scored one goal for the Italian national team and appeared in the 1990 World Cup.
After spells as manager of Reggiana, Parma and Juventus, Ancelotti was appointed Milan manager in 2001. He won the Scudetto in 2004, the Champions League in 2003 and 2007 and the Coppa Italia in 2003. They were also Serie A and Champions League runner-ups in 2005. He is one of six men to have won the European Cup/Champions League as player and manager. In May 2009, he was appointed Chelsea manager and in his first season led them to a historic Premier League and FA Cup Double.

After an uneven 2010–11 Premier League season in which Chelsea failed to retain the title, Ancelotti was dismissed as their manager in May 2011.
On 30 December 2011, Ancelotti signed a contract with ambitious French side Paris Saint-Germain. In his first full season with the club, Ancelotti managed them to the Ligue 1 title and the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League. On 25 June 2013, Real Madrid announced the signing of Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager on a three-year deal. He was presented to the fans the following day.

The Red Wizards of Thay are a fictional organization and social class of evil aligned wizards in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of the Dungeons & Dragons and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing games.  The Red Wizard prestige class is associated with this organization.
According to Ken Rolston, "The haughty and arrogant Red Wizards of Thay employ their awesome sorcerous powers in their expansionistic and imperialistic policy of swallowing up neighbor states."[tpl]cite journal| last = Rolston| first = Ken| authorlink = Ken Rolston| title = Role-playing Reviews| journal = Dragon| issue = #129| pages = 84–86| publisher = TSR| location = Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|date=January 1988[/tpl]
According to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting book, Red Wizards are the usually notorious and nefarious spellcasters who are the ruling class in the inhospitable but well-inhabited country of Thay. The Red Wizards are slavers, demonologists, magical experimenters and scholars. They constantly scheme to bring down their neighbouring nations of Rashemen—where they are thwarted by the Witches of Rashemen; Aglarond—where they are turned back by the Simbul of the Seven Sisters; and Mulhorand—where the people of Thay originated. There are certain academies, such as the Academy of Shapers and Binders in Thaymount, that are considered "anomalies" among the Red Wizards, as they discourage betrayal, deceit and slavery; their members show compassion and mercy unlike most others of their kind.
The leaders of the Red Wizards are the eight zulkirs, each for a different school of magic. Chief among these is Szass Tam, an undead archmage.
The Red Wizards are described as the enemies of many forces in Abeir-Toril—whilst they receive support from demons and devils and drow, among those who oppose them are the Witches of Rashemen, the Seven Sisters and their allies, the goodly Harpers, and even the Zhentarim, who dislike the wizards encroaching on their territory.
The Red Wizards' latest plot, after another failed attempt at securing Rashemen in 1357 DR, is to infiltrate the nations of Faerûn legitimately—in Thayan enclaves which will publicly sell magic items and quietly also traffic drugs, wicked spells, and slaves. Using these they hope to eventually have strongholds and resulting political infiltration that will make them indispensable and powerful, and further their hopes of world domination.
More information about the Red Wizards can be found in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting book, and the supplemental Forgotten Realms sourcebooks Lords of Darkness and Unapproachable East.

The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Mongolia, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; migratory birds probably follow much longer routes than the straight lines, possibly up to 12,000 km, to reach Chilika Lake.
In 1981, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.[tpl]cite web|last=The Ramsar Convention|url= http://www.ramsar.org/key_montreux_record.htm |title=The Montreux Record|date= 26 November 2008|accessdate=2008-12-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801115705/http://www.ramsar.org/key_montreux_record.htm  |archivedate = 1 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Chilika Development Authority|url=http://www.chilika.com/ramsar.htm|title = Ramsar Award|year= 2008|accessdate=2008-12-16[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy Dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians.[tpl]cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Dolphin-population-rises-to-152-in-Chilika-lake-in-Orissa/articleshow/18134076.cms |title=Dolphin population rises to 152 in Chilika lake in Orissa |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-23 |work=The Times Of India |date=22 January 2013[/tpl]
The highly productive chilika lagoon eco-system with its rich fishery resources sustains the livelihood for many fisher men who live in and near the Lagoon. The water spread area of the Lagoon ranges between 1165 to 906 km2 during the monsoon and summer respectively. A 32 km long, narrow, outer channel connects the lagoon to the Bay of Bengal, near the village Motto. More recently a new mouth has been opened by CDA which has brought a new lease of life to the lagoon.
Microalgae, marine seaweeds, sea grasses, fishes and crabs also flourish in the brackish water of the Chilika Lagoon.

CATEGORIES: Geography of the Marlborough Region, Coastline of New Zealand, Sounds of New Zealand

Queen Charlotte Sound is the easternmost of the main sounds of the Marlborough Sounds, in New Zealand's South Island. It is, like the other sounds, a drowned river valley (or ria), and like the majority of its neighbours it runs southwest to northeast before joining Cook Strait. 
The town of Picton, the northern terminus of the South Island's railway and State Highway networks, lies near the head of the Sound. Other settlements by the sound are small and isolated - often simply individual properties. Due to the rugged nature of the coast, for many of these access is by boat only.
To the east of the sound lie Arapawa Island and Tory Channel. Interisland ferries use Tory Channel and Queen Charlotte Sound on their journeys between Picton and Wellington in the North Island. 
Parallel to Queen Charlotte Sound to the northwest lies Kenepuru Sound, an arm of Pelorus Sound, Marlborough's other main sound. Some of the small side arms of the two sounds are only hundreds of metres apart, but are separated by a steep serrated range of hills. Not surprisingly, one of the settlements on this stretch of coast is called Portage, named for the simplest method of passing between the two sounds.
It was from a hill on Arapawa Island in 1770 that Captain James Cook first saw the sea passage from the Pacific Ocean to the Tasman Sea, which was named Cook Strait. Captain Cook sheltered in Queen Charlotte Sound during each of his three voyages of exploration at various points.
The area was a base for whaling throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, notably at Perano Head on Arapawa Island.
Queen Charlotte Sound has calm water and is popular for sailing - a marked contrast to the notorious waters of Cook Strait. Many ships have been wrecked close to the entrance to the Sound, most notably in recent years the Russian cruise liner Mikhail Lermontov, which sank in 1986 in Port Gore after striking rocks. One life was lost in the incident.

[[Cloudy Bay]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of the Marlborough Region, Bays of New Zealand, Wine regions of New Zealand

Cloudy Bay is located at the northeast of New Zealand's South Island, to the south of the Marlborough Sounds. A 2011 Waitangi Tribunal settlement[tpl]cn|date = July 2013[/tpl] will see Cloudy Bay, given this name by Captain Cook in 1770, renamed Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay, with the Māori name recalling the early explorer Kupe scooping up oysters from the bay
The area lends its name to one of the best known New World white wines (Cloudy Bay Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc) although the grapes used in production of that wine are grown in the Marlborough wine region further inland.
The bay faces Cook Strait, stretching north-south over a distance of 30 kilometres from the southern extremity of the Marlborough Sounds (Port Underwood) to White Bluffs. Along its length is the delta of the Wairau River, which reaches the sea at two points. The southern of these forms an entrance to the Big Lagoon, just to the north of White Bluffs. The central point is known as the Wairau Diversion.  There is also a popular swimming beach to the north known as Whites Bay.
Fifteen minutes drive from central Blenheim is Cloudy Bays' beautiful and picturesque coastal community of Rarangi which consists of an original beachfront settlement in the Northern end of Cloudy Bay which ranges from the typical Kiwi Bach or Crib along with some high quality homes. It also has a newer large subdivision consisting of high quality homes within the central part of Cloudy Bay nearer to the coastal man-made river which is known as the Wairau Diversion. This subdivision includes high quality homes along the beachfront and also includes inland housing areas.
Archaeological excavations at Wairau Bar indicate that Māori were living there in the 'moa-hunter' period about 1288 to 1300 for a period of about 20 years. This is the oldest and best researched site of early Polynesian settlement in New Zealand.  Cloudy Bay was named by Captain James Cook on 7 February 1770.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p.67. Sealers first visited about 1826 and set up stations at Port Underwood, the deep inlet at the north of the bay. They were followed by whalers with John Guard setting up a whaling station at Port Underwood in 1828 with his ship the Waterloo. By 1840 there were approximately 150 Europeans in the area, probably the largest concentration in the South Island at that time. Between 1829 and 1832 the Waterloo made  3 return trips to Sydney per year selling seal skins, flax and whale oil  and returning with supplies and trade goods. In 1832 Guard installed Capt Hall as a new master in the Waterloo. On 17 June 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by South Island chiefs at Horahora-Kakahu Island, just off-shore from Port Underwood.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p.149. It was being transported around the New Zealand coast by the Herald.

Clifford Bay is a bay in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand, in the Marlborough Region. It lies between Cloudy Bay to the northwest, and Cape Campbell, the easternmost point of the South Island. The bay's most notable feature is the solar salt extraction works at Lake Grassmere, close to the southern end of the bay.
Since the 1920s, there have been various proposals for an inter-island port and ferry terminal to replace Picton, the last time being in 1995. However, such plans never proceeded beyond an investigation stage, often due to the capital costs.  In May 2011, plans were announced to revisit the development of a port at Clifford Bay, using a mix of private and public funding.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/4976977/Ferry-setting-sail-for-Clifford-Bay |title=Cook Strait ferry setting sail for Clifford Bay |author=Hartevelt, John |date=9 May 2011 |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]
Such a port would reduce both sailing time across the Cook Strait from Wellington and the surface distance to Christchurch. It would also allow fast ferries to operate at higher speeds than they can in the ecologically sensitive Marlborough Sounds and remove the steep grades on the railway line that lead out of Picton.
While a new port at Clifford Bay would have an impact on the economy of Picton, there are positive options to focus Picton as a tourist centre, and the gateway to the Marlborough Sounds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/4984115/New-port-interest-already |title=New port interest already |author=Butterfield, Tania |date=10 May 2011 |work=The Marlborough Express |accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]

News from Nowhere (1890) is a classic work combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer William Morris. In the book, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work.
The book explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris cleverly fuses Marxism and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure; a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.Silver, Carole. The Romance of William Morris. Athens, Ohio: Ohio UP, 1982 The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.
In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common criticisms of socialism; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communistic society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. News From Nowhere was written as a Libertarian socialist response to an earlier book called Looking Backward, a book that epitomises a kind of state socialism that Morris abhorred.
News From Nowhere was first published in serial form in the Commonweal journal beginning on 11 January 1890.

[[Horsley–Clarke apparatus]]
CATEGORIES: Medical equipment, History of neuroscience

The Horsley–Clarke apparatus is a device invented in 1908 by British neurosurgeon and scientist Sir Victor A.H. Horsley and his colleague Robert H. Clarke at University College London to allow experimental and surgical intervention in deep-seated structures of the brain in vertebrates.
Also called a stereotactic device, the system uses a set of three coordinates (x, y, and z) in an orthogonal frame of reference (cartesian coordinates). In a brain atlas, composed by serial transverse sections of the animal or human brain, each brain structure can be assigned a number of coordinates. In most atlas, the three dimensions are: latero-lateral (x), dorso-ventral (y) and rostro-caudal (z). The mechanical device has head-holding clamps and bars which puts the head of the animal in a fixed position in reference to the coordinate system (the so-called zero or origin). Guide bars in the x, y, and z directions, fitted with high precision vernier scales allow the experimenter to position the point of a probe (an electrode, a cannula, etc.) inside the brain, at the calculated coordinates for the desired structure, through a small trephined hole in the skull. Then, stimulation, lesions, tissue biopsies, infusion or diffusion of chemical substances, etc. can be done to that spot or area, using a minimally invasive approach.
The original apparatus was developed for the work with small to medium experimental animals. It was only in 1947 that the first stereotactic devices for human neurosurgery were developed, by the American neurosurgeons Ernest A. Spiegel and Henry T. Wycis, and Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell. Thus, stereotactic surgery of the brain was born. They were initially used for surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (pallidotomy, or the surgical ablation of small areas of the pallidum, an area in the basal ganglia of the brain, which are implicated in the physiological control of movement), but later found many applications in the surgical treatment of tumors, vascular malformations, aneurysms, and abscesses, as well as in functional neurosurgery, such as epilepsy, chronic pain, and mental health (psychosurgery).

A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the 
manufacture of steel.
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. It is produced in a 
two-stage process. First, iron ore is reduced or 
smelted with coke and limestone in a 
or carried to the next stage as molten iron. In the second 
stage, known as steelmaking, impurities such as sulfur, 
elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and 
vanadium are added to produce the exact steel required. Steel mills 
then turn molten steel into blooms, ingots, slabs and sheet through 
casting, hot rolling and cold rolling.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world's largest steel mill
was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company steelworks 
located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom.

Hungarian prehistory ([tpl]lang-hu|magyar őstörténet[/tpl]) refers to the prehistoric Magyars (Hungarians), from the time when they separated from Common Ugric (estimated to correspond to the early 1st millennium BC) until their conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century (known as [tpl]lang|hu|honfoglalás[/tpl] "landtaking" in Hungarian historiography).[tpl]Cite book|editor1-last=Kristó |editor1-first=Gyula, general editor |editor2-last=Engel |editor2-first=Pál |editor3-last=Makk |editor3-first=Ferenc |title=Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9–14. század) (Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History – 9–14th centuries) |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |year=1994 |location=Budapest |page=753 |url=http://www.antikva.hu/onan/reszletek.jsp?katalogusid=154657 |isbn=963-05-6722-9[/tpl] The poorly documented 10th-century Principality of Hungary is  included by some historians as part of Hungarian prehistory.

Antonio Porchia (November 13, 1885 – November 9, 1968) was an Argentinian poet. He was born in Conflenti, Italy, but, after the death of his father in 1900, moved to Argentina. He wrote a Spanish book entitled Voces ("Voices"), a book of aphorisms. It has since been translated into Italian and into English (by W.S. Merwin, Copper Canyon Press, 2003), French, and German. A very influential, yet extremely succinct writer, he has been a cult author for a number of renowned figures of contemporary literature and thought such as André Breton, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Juarroz and Henry Miller, amongst others. Some critics have paralleled his work to Japanese Haiku and found many similarities with a number of Zen schools of thought.

[[Clareification]]

CATEGORIES: Publications associated with the University of Cambridge, Student newspapers published in the United Kingdom

Clareification is the weekly student newsletter of Clare College, a college of the University of Cambridge. One of the things that distinguishes Clare as a particularly friendly and informal college is the fellows' tolerance of the publication, even after the 2007 Muhammad cartoons controversy. Every week in term, Cambridge traditions are mocked, events of the weeks are satirised and silly student antics are reported on. The newsletter also chronicles college gossip in a column written by the Gossip Queen entitled Clareifornication.
Clareification evolved gradually in the mid-late 1990s as a newsletter of the Union of Clare Students. Named as a pun on the college's name, it was padded out with comedy articles, gradually turning into a weekly 8-page comedy paper with only the occasional piece of real news. Spoof formattings of real-life newspapers and magazines are common. It is widely read by Clare students, but academic opinion of it is sharply divided.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, it won the 'Best College Paper' award in The Cambridge Student.
The current editors-in-chief are Euan Holmes, Morven Macaulay and Lizzie Walsh.

[[Open hearth furnace]]

CATEGORIES: Steelmaking, Industrial furnaces

Open hearth furnaces are one of a number of kinds of furnace where excess carbon and other impurities are burnt out of pig iron to produce steel. Since steel is difficult to manufacture due its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the open hearth furnace was developed to overcome this difficulty.  Compared to Bessemer steel, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it didn't expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel.
In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin took out a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. Their process was known as the Siemens-Martin process, and the furnace as an "open-hearth" furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.
While arguably the first primitive open hearth furnace was the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and puddling furnaces from its application.

Lumpy Gravy is the debut solo album by Frank Zappa, recorded with a group of session players he dubbed the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra. It is his third album overall. Released on August 7, 1967 on Capitol Records, it was subsequently reedited and reissued by Verve Records, and later reissued independently by Zappa.
In its original incarnation, Lumpy Gravy served as an album of orchestral music written by Zappa and performed by an orchestra assembled for the album. Zappa conducted the orchestra's performance, and did not perform any instrument on the album. However, MGM Records claimed that the album's production and release violated Zappa's contract with Verve Records. Lumpy Gravy was subsequently reedited by Zappa as part of a project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: We're Only in It for the Money, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat. 
The reedited Lumpy Gravy, released by Verve on May 13, 1968, consisted of two musique concrète pieces which combined elements from the original orchestral performance with elements of surf music and spoken word dialogue. Produced simultaneously with We're Only in It for the Money, the reedited Lumpy Gravy served as the second part of a conceptual continuity which later included Zappa's final album, Civilization Phaze III. The reedited Lumpy Gravy was critically appraised for its unique music and innovative editing techniques.

Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a point-to-point serial protocol that moves data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. SAS replaces the older Parallel SCSI (Small Computer System Interface, pronounced "scuzzy"), bus technology that first appeared in the mid-1980s. SAS, like its predecessor, uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers backward compatibility with SATA, versions 2 and later. This allows for SATA drives to be connected to SAS backplanes. The reverse, connecting SAS drives to SATA backplanes, is not possible.

[[Common ground (communication technique)]]

CATEGORIES: Interpersonal relationships

Finding common ground is a technique for facilitating interpersonal relationships. In order to find common ground between parties, participants must search for signals of recognition, which are often subtle and cause for misunderstanding. Generally, smiles, bland faces, or frowns can be the positive, neutral or negative signals. When verbal communication is possible, the participants can speak and then listen.
Historically, the commons in many communities were a place which was available to everyone, such as the village pump, or the sidewalk of a road. Thus even for those far from home, the sight of someone familiar only from the commons might be comforting to a homesick or lonely traveller. This effect can be seen in many kinship groups. One measure for interpersonal relationships is warmth. Thus discovery of common ground is commonly cause for comfort and additional happiness among the participants, and is one step on the way to respect or perhaps friendship.
However, to some people in small-enough communities, conflict may have occurred between them too often to find common ground, and isolation from each other is the only path toward healing and a healthy relationship. For such people, shunning of the commons is necessary. But if one is forced onto the commons, then a minimal acceptable behavior toward others is necessary when on common ground, as in a truce. 
As an example, one technique for anonymous trade between mutually suspicious parties was for the offerers to lay the goods (such as gold) in a clearing (the potential common ground), and then to hide in the forest with the gold in their plain sight, while armed with weapons, in the event of treachery. Thus, the offers could be made to traders. The traders, who bore goods (and who were also armed with weapons), would lay the trade goods in the clearing, and take the gold back with them. This was a mechanism for trading between the Moors and the gold miners of Africa over a millennium ago, and also for trade with Sumatra (the isle of gold) and other islands of Southeast Asia. This has some structural similarity to the policy of mutually assured destruction during the Cold War era.
Today, we have the advantage of more highly-developed communications techniques, but the basic need for minimizing suspicion and maximizing trust remains with us, worldwide, at a time when polarization is increasing.

Solomon Porcius Sharp (August 22, 1787 – November 7, 1825) was an American attorney and politician, serving as attorney general of Kentucky and a member of the United States Congress and the Kentucky General Assembly. His murder by Jereboam O. Beauchamp in 1825 is referred to as the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy or "The Kentucky Tragedy."
Sharp began his political career representing Warren County, in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He briefly served in the War of 1812, then returned to Kentucky and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1813. He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky's Debt Relief Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor John Adair's appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky. Adair's successor, Joseph Desha, re-appointed him to this position. In 1825, Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House.
In 1820, rumors surfaced that Sharp had fathered a stillborn illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When the charges were repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation that the child was a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).Whited, pp. 404–405

In railway signalling, an interlocking is an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings. The signalling appliances and tracks are sometimes collectively referred to as an interlocking plant. An interlocking is designed so that it is impossible to display a signal to proceed unless the route to be used is proven safe.
In North America, the official railroad definition of interlocking is: "An arrangement of signals and signal appliances so interconnected that their movements must succeed each other in proper sequence".[tpl]cite book|title=Rights of Trains|last1=Josserand |first1=Peter|last2=Forman|first2=Harry Willard|year=1957|edition=5th|publisher=Simmons-Boardman Publishing Corporation|location=New York|page=5|oclc=221677266[/tpl] Definitions.

Richard D. "Dick" Winters (January 21, 1918[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]January 2, 2011) was a United States Army officer and decorated war veteran. He commanded Company "E", 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, during World War II.
Winters parachuted into Normandy in the early hours of D-Day, and fought across France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and eventually Germany. Later in the war, Winters rose to command the 2nd Battalion. Following the German surrender, he left the 506th and was then stationed in France where senior officers were needed to oversee the return home. In 1951, during the Korean War, Winters was recalled to the U.S. Army from the inactive list and briefly served as a regimental planning and training officer on staff at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Winters was issued orders for deployment and was preparing to depart for Korea, but instead left the Army under a provision that allowed officers who had served in World War II but had been inactive since to resign their commission.
Winters was discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to civilian life, working first in New Jersey and later in Pennsylvania, where he set up his own company selling chocolate byproducts from The Hershey Company to producers of animal feed. He was a regular guest lecturer at the United States Military Academy at West Point until his retirement in 1997. He was the last surviving Easy Company commander.
Winters was featured in a number of books and was portrayed by Damian Lewis in the 2001 HBO mini-series Band of Brothers.

Tokyo Warhearts is the first live album by the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom which was recorded in 1999. It was recorded and filmed on July 10 and 11 of 1999 in Tokyo. The album was re-released on May 29, 2001. The band and their record label, Spinefarm Records, had plans to release the show as a DVD along with the CD, but they reached the conclusion that there were some mismatches between the video and the audio, as there was video footage from two different shows.
Two of the songs from this album have been released separately for promotional purposes and can be found on a Spinefarm DVD compilation: Silent Night, Bodom Night and Deadnight Warrior.
Track 1 covers a segment of Jan Hammer's "Crockett's Theme" from the Miami Vice soundtrack. At the end of track 6 a brief part of the riff of "Crazy Nights" by Loudness is played. Loudness is a Japanese band. They later covered the song and released it as a bonus track with the album Halo of Blood. The intro for track 9 is a strain of music called "Hummel Gets the Rockets" which was composed by Hans Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith for the 1996 film The Rock.

The Adelaide O-Bahn Busway is a guided busway located in Adelaide, South Australia. The O-Bahn – from the Latin omnibus ("for all people") and the German bahn (railway, as in S-Bahn and U-Bahn) – was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen.[tpl]cite book|title=Transit Australia Magazine July 1997 |publisher=Transit Australia Publishing|chapter =Guided Busway Development [/tpl]
Adelaide's O-Bahn was introduced in 1986 to service the city's rapidly expanding north-eastern suburbs, replacing an earlier plan for a tramway extension. The Adelaide O-bahn was the first  bus rapid transit system in Australia and among the first to operate in the world.
The O-bahn design is unique among public transport systems; busways typically use dedicated bus lanes or separate carriageways, but the O-Bahn runs on specially built track, combining elements of both bus and rail systems. Adelaide's track is [tpl]convert|12|km|mi[/tpl] long and includes one station and two interchanges: Klemzig Station in Klemzig, Paradise Interchange in Campbelltown and Tea Tree Plaza Interchange in Modbury. Interchanges allow buses to enter and exit the busway and to continue on suburban routes, avoiding the need for passengers to change. Buses travel at a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], and the busway is capable of carrying 18,000 passengers an hour, from the Central Business District to Tea Tree Plaza in 15 minutes. Services are operated under contract from Adelaide Metro, an agency of the South Australian Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure.
It was planned that bus routes serving the O-Bahn would be enhanced from Hackney Road along Grenfell and Currie streets and extended to West Terrace on the far side of the CBD along dedicated bus lanes. However, the Federal Government announced in January 2011, as part of its response to the 2010–2011 Queensland floods, that the extension would be cancelled "as a result of a significant scope reduction of the original project, resulting in only limited transport benefits".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pm.gov.au/sites/default/files/attachment2_rebuilding_floods.doc|title=Australian Federal Government: Paying for recovery and restruction|publisher=Australian Federal Government (Prime Minister)|date=27 January 2011|accessdate =27 January 2011[/tpl]

[[Robertsbridge Codex]]
CATEGORIES: Medieval music manuscript sources, British Library additional manuscripts

The Robertsbridge Codex (1360) is a music manuscript of the 14th century.  It contains the earliest surviving music written specifically for keyboard. 
The term codex is somewhat misleading: the musical section of the source comprises only two leaves, bound together with a larger manuscript from Robertsbridge, Sussex, England.Caldwell, "Keyboard music: I.1."
It contains six pieces, three of them in the form of the estampie, an Italian dance form of the Trecento, as well as three arrangements of motets.  Two of the motets are from the Roman de Fauvel.  All of the music is anonymous, and all is written in tablature.  Most of the music for the estampies is for two voices, often in parallel fifths, and also using hocket technique.  Most likely the instrument used to play the pieces in the Codex was the organ.  Formerly the date of the Codex was presumed to be around 1330,Gilbert Reaney, Manuscripts of Polyphonic Music (c. 1320-1400), RISM B/IV/2 (Munich: Henle Verlag, 1969). but more recent research has suggested a later date, slightly after mid-century.E. H. Roesner: Introduction to Philippe de Vitry: Complete Works'' (Monaco, 1984)
The manuscript used to be considered Italian and connected to the main streams of the Italian trecento in its contents and in its clear use of puncti divisionis (dots of division).  However, scholarly consensus now considers the source English.John Caldwell, "Sources of keyboard music to 1660: 2. Principal Individual Sources: (vi) British Isles", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed April 21, 2007), (subscription access).
The Codex is in the British Library (additional manuscript 28550).

USS ''Capitaine'' (SS/AGSS-336), a Balao-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the capitaine, a brilliantly colored fish inhabiting waters of the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to Panama.
Capitaine (SS-336) was launched 1 October 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. J. A. Rondomanski; commissioned 26 January 1945, Lieutenant Commander E. S. Friedrick in command; and assigned to the Pacific Fleet.
Capitaine got underway from New London 7 March 1945 to arrive at Pearl Harbor 15 April. On 6 May, she cleared for her first war patrol, off the coast of Indochina north of Saigon. Enemy targets were disappointingly few for a new submarine, for the Navy had almost completely swept the sea of Japanese shipping by this time. 
On 16 June, she rescued from the sea five Japanese survivors of a merchant ship previously sunk by other forces. After refueling at Subic Bay, Capitaine continued her patrol south of Borneo in the Java Sea. On 30 June, she joined [tpl]USS|Baya|SS-318|3[/tpl] in a concerted gun attack on five small enemy craft, one  {Bandai Maru} which she sank after its crew had abandoned it.
Refitted at Fremantle, Australia, Capitaine sailed for her second war patrol, arriving in her assigned area just three days before hostilities ended. She returned to the west coast in September 1945, but in January 1946 was bound for the Far East once more, training in Philippine waters through March. A month of operations at Pearl Harbor preceded her return to San Diego, from which, after an overhaul, she made two simulated war patrols in 1947 and 1948, and conducted local training and services. The submarine was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 10 February 1950. 
Capitaine was recommissioned 23 February 1957, and reported to the Pacific Fleet a month later. From her base at San Diego, she took part in training, served other fleet units as target in antisubmarine exercises, and training reservists, as well as voyaging to the Far East for 7th Fleet duty, through 1960. On 1 July 1960 Capitaine was reclassified an  Auxiliary Research Submarine, AGSS-336.
In 1964 Capitaine took part in the movie In Harm's Way.
Capitaine received one battle star for World War II service.

[[Randolph Carter]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional writers, Mortals in the Cthulhu Mythos, Fictional characters from Massachusetts, Fictional characters introduced in 1919, Characters in short stories

Randolph Carter is a recurring protagonist in H. P. Lovecraft's fiction and—presumably—a disguised alter ego of Lovecraft himself. He first appears in "The Statement of Randolph Carter" (1919), a short story based on one of Lovecraft's dreams.
Carter shares many of Lovecraft's personal traits: He is an uncelebrated author, whose writings are seldom noticed. A melancholy figure, Carter is a quiet contemplative dreamer with a sensitive disposition, prone to fainting during times of emotional stress. But he can also be courageous, with enough strength of mind and character to face and foil the horrific creatures of the Dreamlands (see also Lovecraft's Dream Cycle).

The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is a novella by H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937).  Begun probably in the autumn of 1926, it was completed in on January 22, 1927 and was unpublished in his lifetime. It is both the longest of the stories that comprise his Dream Cycle and the longest Lovecraft work to feature protagonist Randolph Carter. Along with his 1927 novel The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, it can be considered one of the significant achievements of that period of Lovecraft's writing. The Dream-Quest combines elements of horror and fantasy into an epic tale that illustrates the scope and wonder of humankind's ability to dream.
The story was published posthumously by Arkham House in 1943.Lovecraft, H.P. and Joshi, S.T. (editor): Dreams in the Witch House and Other Weird Stories, page 433. Penguin Classics, 2004. Currently, it is published by Ballantine Books in an anthology that also includes "The Silver Key" and "Through the Gates of the Silver Key." The definitive version, with corrected text by S. T. Joshi, is published by  Arkham House in At the Mountains of Madness and Other Novels and by Penguin Classics in The Dreams in the Witch-House and Other Weird Stories.

King's Highway 400, commonly referred to as Highway 400, historically as the Toronto–Barrie Highway, and colloquially as the 400, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario linking the city of Toronto in the urban and agricultural south of the province with the scenic and sparsely populated central and northern regions. The portion of the highway between Toronto and Lake Simcoe roughly traces the route of a historic trail between the Lower and Upper Great Lakes. Highway 400 is part of the highest-capacity route from southern Ontario to the Canadian West, via a connection with the Trans-Canada Highway in Sudbury. The highway also serves as the primary route from Toronto to southern Georgian Bay and Muskoka, areas collectively known as cottage country. North of the Jane Street exit in north-west Toronto, the 400 is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police and has a speed limit of [tpl]convert|100|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. To the south it is patrolled by the Toronto Police Service and the speed limit drops to [tpl]convert|80|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] approaching Maple Leaf Drive, where the freeway becomes known as Black Creek Drive.
Highway 400 is the second longest freeway in the province, the trans-provincial Highway 401 being the longest. It was the first fully controlled-access highway in Ontario when it was opened between North York and Barrie on July 1, 1952. On that date, it was also the first highway to be designated as a 400-series. The freeway was extended in both directions; north of Barrie to Coldwater in 1958, and south of Highway 401 to Jane Street in 1966. It was widened between North York and Barrie in the 1970s. Since 1977, construction on the freeway has been snaking north along Highway 69 towards Parry Sound and now Sudbury.
As of 2011, a four lane freeway is opened as far north as Carling. At the north end of Highway 69, a segment of freeway is in operation between Murdock River and Sudbury; while this section will be part of the completed Highway 400 route, at present it remains signed as Highway 69. The remaining gap between Carling and Murdock River will be opened in stages and is expected to be completed by 2017.

Goryeong Gaya was one of the lesser chiefdoms of the Gaya confederacy during the Korean Three Kingdoms period.  It was centered in present-day Sangju City, North Gyeongsang province, South Korea.  Legend indicates that it was founded by a King Taejo, to whom a tomb on Obong Mountain in Hamchang-eup, Sangju, is attributed.  
An alliance of marriage was established between Silla and Goryeong Gaya in 522.  For this reason, Goryeong Gaya did not participate in the Baekje-Daegaya offensive against Silla in 538.  However, it does not appear that this alliance was of any lasting benefit to the kingdom.  According to both the Samguk Sagi and the Japanese chronicle Nihonshoki, Goryeong Gaya fell to Silla in 562.  This was the same year that Daegaya was overrun in the south.
The members of today's Hamchang Kim lineage trace their origins to the kings of Goryeong Gaya.

The Tokyo Shock Boys (東京ショック男の子) (電撃ネットワーク; Dengeki Network) is a Japanese group of five men who perform dangerous and crude stunts. In 2012 they announced on the Dengeki Network 'Day long takeover' (一日中買収) that they had a new member only known as (ジョシュア) or the Latin 'Joshua', who has now been seen to be 'Baggott' (袋ゴット) as his nick and brand name suggests from products.
The group was formed in Tokyo in 1990. The Tokyo Shock Boys have a huge cult following in Japan and have appeared in many other locales, such as Australia, Canada, Germany and Scotland in the United Kingdom.
In 2006 they made appearances in Japanorama, Adam & Joe go Tokyo and the Dirty Sanchez movie. However, their shows are viewed as having more 'magic' stunts rather than painful ones. This was proven in Dirty Sanchez: The Movie as the Tokyo Shock Boys refused to do a  show with Dirty Sanchez due to the fact they viewed their stunts to be too extreme. 
The members of the group are:
On volume 2 of the manga Yu-Gi-Oh!, when asked to slide one's foot inside a shoe with a scorpion, Yugi, Jonouchi, and Honda respond, "Who do you think we are, the Tokyo Shock Boys?" 
They have since become a huge success. This is due to the huge range of products the Shockboys have now released. These span from spoof items such as 'Baggott's Bean Pie' to actual action figurines of the five members. The success is thought to be due to new member 'Baggott' having a close relationship to famous actor Nicolas Cage.

Tapuae-o-Uenuku, formerly Mount Tapuaenuku, is the highest peak in the northeast of New Zealand's South Island. The name translates from Māori as "footprint of the rainbow", though is usually regarded as being named after Chief Tapuaenuku.[tpl]ReedPlacenames1975[/tpl]
At [tpl]convert|2885|m|ft|0[/tpl] it is the highest mountain in New Zealand outside the main ranges of the Southern Alps, and over 80 metres taller than the tallest peak on the North Island.
It dominates the Inland Kaikoura Range, rising high above the valleys of the Clarence and Awatere Rivers. It can be seen from as far away as Cape Terawhiti on the southwestern tip of the North Island, nearly 120 kilometres away, and is a prominent point on the horizon for travellers on the interisland ferries that ply Cook Strait.
The first European to sight the mountain was James Cook, who called it Mount Odin, but later nicknamed it "The Watcher" since his ship seemed to be visible from it at so many points along the coast. The first Europeans to attempt to climb the mountain were Edward John Eyre, Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster, and William John Warburton Hamilton, in 1849. They came within a short distance of the summit but were forced to turn back.Wise's New Zealand Guide. (1969). Dunedin: H. Wise and Co.

[[Peptidomimetic]]
CATEGORIES: Molecular biology

A peptidomimetic is a small protein-like chain designed to mimic a peptide.  They typically arise either from modification of an existing peptide, or by designing similar systems that mimic peptides, such as peptoids and β-peptides.  Irrespective of the approach, the altered chemical structure is designed to advantageously adjust the molecular properties such as, stability or biological activity.  This can have a role in the development of drug-like compounds from existing peptides.  These modifications involve changes to the peptide that will not occur naturally (such as altered backbones and the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids).

[[Ladder of thirds]]
CATEGORIES: Modal frames

A ladder of thirds (coined by van der Merwe 1989, adapted from Curt Sachs) is similar to the circle of fifths, though a ladder of thirds differs in being composed of thirds, major or minor, and may or may not circle back to its starting note and thus may or may not be an interval cycle.
Triadic chords may be considered as part of a ladder of thirds.
It is a modal frame found in Blues and British folk music. Though a pentatonic type, the melodies come "into being through piling up thirds below and/or above a tonic or central note." (Middleton 1990, p.203) pentatonic scales are analyzed as piled fifths
They are "commonplace in post-rock 'n' roll popular music - and also appear in earlier tunes". (Middleton 1990, p.203) Examples include The Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night", Buddy Holly's "Peggy Sue" and The Who's "My Generation", Ben Harney's "You've Been A Good Old Wagon" (1895) and Ben Bernie et al.'s "Sweet Georgia Brown" (1925).

Like other Monpa, they are also adherents of Tibetan Buddhism. However, like the Lishipa, they are considered just as inferior to the Monpa as both groups are descended from the early waves of immigrants from Tibet via Bhutan or from Tibet. Like most Buddhist tribes, they built houses based on stones and follow a Tibetan Buddhist culture, though they might not be as advanced as the Monpa.

In February 2013, he was named winner of the 2012 George Polk Award in journalism in the political reporting category for his video and reporting of the "47 percent story," Republican nominee Mitt Romney's videoed meeting with donors during the 2012 presidential campaign.Monica Bauerlein and Clara Jeffery, "Mother Jones' David Corn Wins George Polk Award," Mother Jones, February 17, 2013.
As an author, Corn's output includes nonfiction and fiction and generally deals with government and politics. Corn has also been a book reviewer. On one occasion, he criticized his own organization when Nation Books published the translation of a controversial French book on Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks. Forbidden Truth: US-Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy and the Failed Hunt for Bin Laden, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquié, suggests that the attacks resulted from a breakdown in talks between the Taliban and the United States to run an oil pipeline through Afghanistan. Corn argued that publishing "contrived conspiracy theories" undermined the ability to expose actual governmental misbehavior.Rutten, Tim.

[[Kaikoura Peninsula]]

CATEGORIES: Kaikoura District, Peninsulas of New Zealand, Geography of the Canterbury Region

The Kaikoura Peninsula is located in the northeast of New Zealand's South Island. It protrudes five kilometres into the Pacific Ocean. The town of Kaikoura is located on the north shore of the peninsula. The peninsula has been settled by Maori for approximately 1000 years, and by Europeans since the 1800s when whaling operations began off the Kaikoura Coast. Since the end of whaling in 1922 whales have been allowed to thrive and the region is now a popular whale watching destination.
The Kaikoura Peninsula is made up of limestone and mudstone which have been deposited, uplifted and deformed throughout the Quaternary. The peninsula is situated in a tectonically active region bounded by the Marlborough Fault System.
The Kaikoura Canyon is a submarine canyon situated 500 metres off the coast to the south-east of the peninsula. It is 60 km long, up to 1200 m deep, and is generally U-shaped. It is an active canyon that merges into a deep-ocean channel system that meanders for hundreds of kilometres across the deep ocean floor.

[[Enterprise bargaining agreement]]

CATEGORIES: Australian labour law, Industrial agreements

Enterprise bargaining is wage and working conditions being negotiated at the level of the individual organizations. Once established, they are legally binding on employers and employees.
An Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) consists of a collective industrial agreement between either an employer and a trade union acting on behalf of employees or an employer and employees acting for themselves.
On the one hand collective agreements, at least in principle, benefit employers, as they allow for improved "flexibility" in such areas as ordinary hours, flat rates of hourly pay, and performance-related conditions. On the other hand collective agreements benefit workers, as they usually provide higher pay, bonuses, additional leave and enhanced entitlements (such as redundancy pay) than an award does.

Gerhard Schrader (25 February 1903 – 10 April 1990) was a German chemist specializing in the discovery of new insecticides, hoping to make progress in the fight against hunger in the world. Schrader is best known for his accidental discovery of nerve agents such as sarin and tabun, and for this he is sometimes called the "father of the nerve agents".Tucker, Jonathon. War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare From World War I to Al-Qaeda. Pantheon Books, 2006.
Schrader grew up in Bortfeld, near Wendeburg, Germany, studied chemistry at TU Braunschweig, and was later employed at the Bayer AG division of IG Farben.
Schrader discovered several very effective insecticides, including bladan (the first fully synthetic contact insecticide), and parathion (E 605). In 1936, while employed by the large German conglomerate IG Farben, he was experimenting with a class of compounds called organophosphates, which killed insects by interrupting their nervous systems. Instead of a new insecticide, he accidentally discovered tabun, an enormously toxic organophosphate compound still sometimes stockpiled today as a nerve agent. During World War II, under the Nazi regime, teams led by Schrader discovered two more organophosphate nerve agents, and a fourth after the war:

[[Pattern bargaining]]

CATEGORIES: Trade unions, Negotiation, Industrial agreements

Pattern bargaining is a process in labour relations, where a trade union gains a new and superior entitlement from one employer and then uses that agreement as a precedent to demand the same entitlement or a superior one from other employers.
In the United States, pattern bargaining was pioneered by unions such as the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters. The first step of the bargaining process is the identification of a target employer that is most likely to agree to a favorable employment contract. For the selected company, this provides an opportunity to influence the contract for the industry, while the downside is the risk of a labor disruption if negotiations stall or fail. Once this contract has been successfully negotiated and ratified by the unionized workers, the union declares it a "pattern agreement" and presents it to the other employers as a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
In Australia, pattern bargaining was specifically outlawed under the now-repealed WorkChoices legislation. The law was repealed by the Labor party after their victory in the 2007 election, but Labor's Fair Work Act, which came into force on 1 July 2010, still outlaws pattern bargaining.

[[Industrial award]]

CATEGORIES: Australian labour law, Industrial agreements

An award is a ruling handed down by either Fair Work New Zealand or by a state industrial relations commission which grants all wage earners in one industry or occupation the same minimum conditions of employment and wages.  
Federal awards in Australia have been stripped back in recent years in what they are allowed to contain in order to promote the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement system.  Awards in Australia are part of the system of compulsory arbitration in industrial relations.
A similar system was also used in New Zealand prior to the 1987 Labour Relations Act. New Zealand no longer uses the award system, and the only form of collective bargaining is Collective Employment Agreements, which only apply to the particular unions and employers that negotiate them.

Samira Bellil (November 24, 1972 – September 7, 2004) was a French feminist activist and a campaigner for the rights of girls and women.
Bellil became famous in France with the publication of her autobiographical book Dans l'enfer des tournantes ('In the hell of the "tournantes" (gang-rapes)) in 2002. The book discusses the violence she and other young women endured in the predominantly Muslim immigrant outskirts of Paris, where she was repeatedly gang-raped as a teenager by gangs led by people she knew, and then abandoned by her family and friends. Her book is a portrayal of the predicament of young girls in the poor,  outlying suburbs (banlieue) of French cities.

CATEGORIES: Presidency of George W. Bush, 2001 in American politics, 2002 in American politics, 2003 in American politics, 2004 in American politics, 2005 in American politics

George W. Bush's first term as president of the United States began on January 20, 2001 and continued until his second term commenced on January 20, 2005. By far the most memorable event of this first term in office was the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.
Bush was instrumental in pushing forward legislation in education and national security, in bringing about tax-reduction and allocating funds for global emergency AIDS relief. He withdrew the United States from participation in the 1998 Kyoto Protocol on world climate change and from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as well as withdrawing U.S. support for the International Criminal Court, but his legacy was defined by his response to the 9/11 terrorist attack.
Shortly after the terrorist attack, a U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan resulted in the overthrow of the Taliban government in Kabul, a regime which had allowed terrorist training camps, directed at western targets, to operate in Afghanistan. This approach was symptomatic of a change in the perception of the world and of the international threats to the United States, one expounded in Bush's 2002 State of the Union Address and known subsequently as the Bush Doctrine. The United States gave itself the right to pursue its enemies wherever they could be found. In 2003, a U.S.-led military force invaded Iraq.

Alain Chamfort (born Alain Le Govic; 2 March 1949 in Paris) is a French singer of Breton origin.
He was a promising pianist in his youth, and the piano became his instrument of choice. His first band, "The Dreamers" had minor success as a repertory jazz outfit, and was followed by a typically sixties rock music group "Murator".
He met famed writer and producer, Jacques Dutronc, who proposed to help Chamfort with future works for television and film, and it is with Dutronc that Chamfort's career expanded. After being discovered by Dutronc, it was with Claude François and ultimately Serge Gainsbourg that he made a number of albums, including his first album recorded as Alain Chamfort: "Manureva". The song of the same name remains one of the most famous to date by Chamfort.  
Alain Chamfort composed for the cinema; he worked with Jean-Pierre Mocky and with Arnaud Sélignac. As an actor, he was in front of the camera in "Men/Toys/Girl" in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG9imuylOYg |title=Men/Toys/Girl |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27[/tpl] In 2004, he became a member of the board of directors of SACEM.

[[Electrostatic lens]]

CATEGORIES: Electrostatics, Spectroscopy

An electrostatic lens is a device that assists in the transport of charged particles. For instance, it can guide electrons emitted from a sample to an electron analyzer, analogous to the way an optical lens assists in the transport of light in an optical instrument. Systems of electrostatic lenses can be designed in the same way as optical lenses, so electrostatic lenses easily magnify or converge the electron trajectories. An electrostatic lens can also be used to focus an ion beam, for example to make a microbeam for irradiating individual cells.

CATEGORIES: 1849 births, 1923 deaths, Canadian knights, People from Toronto, Canadian people in rail transport, Canadian railway entrepreneurs, Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)

Sir William Mackenzie (October 17, 1849 – December 5, 1923) was a Canadian railway contractor and entrepreneur.
Born near Peterborough, Ontario, Mackenzie became a teacher and politician before entering business as the owner of a sawmill and gristmill in Kirkfield, Ontario. He entered the railway business as a contractor under civil engineer James Ross, working on projects in Ontario, British Columbia, Maine, and the North-West Territories (present-day Saskatchewan and Alberta) between 1874 and 1891.
In partnership with his mentor James Ross, Mackenzie became owner of the Toronto Street Railway (precursor to the Toronto Transit Commission) in 1891 and in 1899, helped found the precursor to Brazilian Traction, for which he was the first chairman. In 1895, together with Donald Mann, Mackenzie began to purchase or build rail lines in the Canadian prairies, which would form the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a company that would stretch from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton Island and form Canada's second transcontinental railway system. He started Pat Burns' career by giving him a series of contracts for provisioning food for the railway contract. Burns would go on to build one of the World's largest meat empires.
Mackenzie and Mann were knighted in 1911 for their efforts in the railway industry, but personal and company financial difficulties led to the bankruptcy of the CNoR. The system was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918, and subsequently became part of the Canadian National Railway.
Mackenzie died in Toronto, Ontario. He was inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 along with partner Mann.

[[Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra]]

Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra (also known as Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in E Flat Minor Op.1) is an album released in 1998 by Yngwie J. Malmsteen on Spitfire Records. It was his first attempt at a classical concerto suite featuring electric guitar solos.  Malmsteen composed all of the music though his compositions were scored by his friend and fellow musician David Rosenthal.  The music is conducted by Yoel Levi, and performed by the Czech Philharmonic.
Malmsteen has been keen to emphasize that unlike other collaborations between rock musicians and classical orchestras (e.g. Metallica's performances with the San Francisco Symphony or Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra), which feature a rock group playing with orchestral accompaniment, this is orchestral music which happens to have an electric guitar as its solo instrument.
Malmsteen has acknowledged that in many of the pieces he had to overdub in his guitar solos to make them "fit".  However, the entire piece has since been performed live in Japan with the New Japan Philharmonic and is available as a DVD release.

Sir Donald Mann (March 23, 1853 – November 10, 1934) was a Canadian railway contractor and entrepreneur.
Born at Acton, Canada West, Mann studied as a Methodist minister but worked in lumber camps in Ontario and Michigan before moving to Winnipeg, Manitoba.  During the 1880s he worked as a contractor under Chief Engineer James Ross, building sections of the Canadian Pacific Railway across the prairies and through the Rocky Mountains.
Partnering with William Mackenzie, Mann built railway lines in western Canada, Maine, Brazil, and China.  In 1895, together with Mackenzie he began the process of purchasing and building the lines in western Canada which would later become the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR), a system which would stretch from Vancouver Island to Cape Breton Island and form Canada's second transcontinental railway system.
Both Mann and Mackenzie were knighted in 1911 for their efforts in the Canadian railway industry; however, personal and company financial difficulties eventually resulted in the bankruptcy of the CNoR.  It was nationalized by the federal government on September 6, 1918, and ultimately became part of the Canadian National Railway.
He is also known for donating the Mann Cup. The Mann Cup is the trophy awarded to the senior men's lacrosse champions of Canada. The cup is made of solid gold, and it was donated in 1910.
Mann turned to mining and died in Toronto, Ontario. Mann died in 1934 at the age of 81.
A park named for Sir Donald Mann is in Acton, Ontario. It is adjacent the railway, near the Beardmore Tannery once owned by Canada Packers (closed 1986) at Longfield Road and Moybray Place.

[[Kharoti]]

CATEGORIES: Ghilzai Pashtun tribes

Kharoti (Pashto: خروټی)  is a Pashtun tribe of Ghilzai origin. The Kharoti, like other Ghilzais, have a reputation for fierce independence and resistance to outside governance in any form. Many of the Kharoti are or were Kuchis. They have an estimated population of about 5.5 million, making it one of, if not the largest tribes in Afghanistan.
The Kharoti are one of Afghanistan's largest and most widespread tribes, with significant territory throughout eastern and south-eastern Afghanistan. However, their traditional heartland is in Loya Paktia and specifically in the territory of Paktika province. There are major Kharoti populations in the Paktika districts of Urgun, Barmal, Sar Hawza, Zarghun Shahr, Omna, Surobi and Gomal where they are accompanied primarily by the Sulaimankhel, Wazir and Zadran tribes.Paktika Personalities: An Examination of the Tribes and the Significant People of a Traditional Pashtun Province - Timothy S. Timmons and Rashid Hassanpoor (2007) The Kharoti also have a strong presence in Ghazni, Zabul, Paktia, Khost, Logar, Wardak, Kabul and Nangarhar.
Their tribal rivals are the Wazirs, Sulaimankhel and Furmalis, both of whom believe the Furmali area belongs to them. Despite having a common Ghilzai origin, the much larger and more powerful Suleimankhel super-tribe are the Kharotis' traditional rivals.  
The majority of Kharoti tribesmen are associated with businesses in overseas countries in Europe, America, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and in Karachi, Pakistan where they have carpets and fabrics businesses. 
The Kharoti tribe is one of first Pashtun tribes to have their own organizations in Pakistan. There are two such NGO's, The Kharoti Committee, led by Haji Juma Gul Khan, which helps the poor in Sar Hawza, Paktika and the Kharoti Welfare Association, led by Haji Ameer Gul. 
The most prominent figures of the Kharoti tribe include Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Farhad Darya, Gholam Serwar Nasher, Rahman Kharoti, Ustad Sayaf, Loy Sher Khan Bander and the late Mir Ahmad Khan Qader.
Since April the 2nd, 2011, Naqibullah Shorish has been chosen by the elders as the main leader of the Kharoti tribe in all parts of Afghanistan. Naqibullah Shorish was already an elder of the Kharoti community of the district Khaki Jabbar in the Kabul Province. He lived in Germany for more than 20 years, before deciding to return to Afghanistan in 2008. He is also one of the main members of the Afghan Peace Jirga, who's main purpose is to support negotiations between the Taliban, NATO and the Afghan government.
The Nasher Clan of the Kharoti tribe is based in the Konduz Province in Northern Afghanistan, where they were exiled by the ruling Abdali/Durrani tribes.

[[Banyan (band)]]
CATEGORIES: Alternative rock groups from California

Banyan is an art rock/alternative rock band with heavy jazz, and funk influence, based in Los Angeles, California.
The leader and co-founder is Stephen Perkins, who first played drums for Jane's Addiction (1986–1991, plus later regroupings), and then for Porno for Pyros. He co-founded the group with Emit Bloch. The core members of the band are Nels Cline on guitar,  Willie Waldman on trumpet and Mike Watt (Minutemen) on bass. Mike Watt also sings on some Banyan songs. Both Mike Watt and Nels Cline generally play only West Coast dates and at various times the band has had Rob Wasserman on bass and Clint Wagner on guitar fill in when they are unavailable. Saxophone players Steve Mackay and Herman Green, guitar player Calvin Newborn, and bass player J. D. Westmoreland have also joined the band during select live shows. 
Los Angeles artist Norton Wisdom paints on a wet-erase board while the band plays, and the imagery he creates interprets the music much in the same way that lyrics might. To see the band in more than one performance, you will see some images that recur and some that are new, since the songs are compositions whose structure remains the same while there is also a large amount of improvisation, in the jazz tradition.
The first EP featured Money Mark as keyboardist labeled as the Freeway Keyboardist. The first album was engineered by the Dust Brothers at their studio and produced by Turin and Perkins.
Notable guest appearances on the second album Anytime at All include Flea, John Frusciante (both from the Red Hot Chili Peppers), Martyn LeNoble (Perkins' former bandmate from Porno for Pyros), Rob Wasserman and Buckethead. 
For their third album Live At Perkins' Palace (named after the fact that it was recorded at Perkins' home studio, not after the live performance venue of the same name), the band reduced itself to a four-piece unit of Perkins, Watt, Cline, and Waldman. 
Steve Kimock sat-in with Banyan during their August 26, 2007 performance at the Riverview Music Festival in Chicago, IL.
In liner notes and personal conversations, members of the band cite Igor Stravinsky and Miles Davis as influences.

After a successful tour, they released the live album Rock N' Roll Noodle Shop: Live from Tokyo and then the full album The Art of Losing, in 2002 and 2003 respectively. After this, the group was dropped from their label, Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to remake their production and sound. Working with veteran music producer Butch Walker, they released Hearts on Parade in 2005. The band then toured to a widespread fan-base in Japan and in the United States. Finally the band came back after five years of interval, releasing their fourth studio album Fight the Frequency in August 2010.

Johann Wolfgang Ritter[tpl]German title Ritter[/tpl] von Kempelen de Pázmánd (23 January 1734 – 26 March 1804) was an  author and inventor, known for his chess-playing "automaton" hoax The Turk and for his speaking machine.
Von Kempelen was born in Pressburg, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary within the Habsburg Empire, into a German-speaking family; his father was Engelbert Kempelen (1680–1761), his mother was Ágnes Mohai. The  Kempelen family had settled in Pressburg in 1640.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] and was supposedly of Irish ancestry,[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] even thought the name Kempelen itself is Hungarian.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
Von Kempelen studied law and philosophy in Pressburg, and then in Győr, Vienna and Rome, but mathematics and physics also interested him. He spoke German, Hungarian, Latin, French, Italian, and later also English.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
He started to work as a clerk in Vienna.
Von Kempelen was most famous for his construction of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton presented to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1770. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, dressed in Turkish robes and a turban, seated behind a large cabinet on top of which a chessboard was placed.Ricky Jay, "The Automaton Chess Player, the Invisible Girl, and the Telephone", Jay's Journal of Anomalies, vol. 4 no. 4, 2000. The machine appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, but was in fact merely an elaborate simulation of mechanical automation: a human chess master concealed inside the cabinet puppeteered the Turk from below by means of a series of levers. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin.[tpl]cite book| author = Tom Standage| title = The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous 19th Century Chess-Playing Machine| date = 2002-04-01| publisher = Walker| isbn = 978-0-8027-1391-9 [/tpl]
Kempelen created a manually operated speaking machine.Flanagan, James L., "Speech Analysis, Synthesis and Perception", Springer-Verlag, 1965, pp. 166–167.thumb|left|A reconstruction of Kempelen's speaking machine
He constructed steam-engines, waterpumps, a pontoon bridge in Pressburg (1770), patented a steam turbine for mills (1788/89) and a typewriter for the blind Viennese pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (1772), and built a theatre house in Buda (inaugurated 25 October 1790) (now Budapest) and the famous fountains at Schönbrunn in Vienna. The reconstruction of the destroyed Buda castle was also partly led by von Kempelen. He was also a talented drawer and etcher; and he wrote poems and epigrams. He composed a singspiel, Andromeda and Perseus, performed in Vienna.
He was married twice, and had five children from the second marriage, of whom two survived into adulthood. He died poor because the Austrian emperor withdrew[tpl]When|date=February 2012[/tpl] his economic support. Von Kempelen died in Vienna. The Wolfgang von Kempelen Computing Science History Prize was named in his honor, as was a high school in Budapest.

[[Black operation]]

CATEGORIES: Secret government programs

A black operation or black op is a covert operation by a government, a government agency, or a military organization. This can include activities by private companies or groups. Key features of a black operation are that it is clandestine, it has negative overtones, and it is not attributable to the organization carrying it out.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith, Jr.|first=W. Thomas|title=Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency|page=31|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8160-4666-2|page=31[/tpl] The main difference between a black operation and one that is merely clandestine is that a black operation involves a significant degree of deception, to conceal who is behind it or to make it appear that some other entity is responsible ("false flag" operations).Popular Electronics, Volume 6, Issue 2–6. Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., Inc. 1974, p. 267. "There are three classifications into which the intelligence community officially divides clandestine broadcast stations. A black operation is one in which there is a major element of deception."Djang, Chu, From Loss to Renewal: A Tale of Life Experience at Ninety, Authors Choice Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, p. 54. "(A black operation was) an operation in which the sources of propaganda were disguised or mispresented in one way or another so as not to be attributed to the people who really engineered it." 
A single such activity may be called a "black bag operation"; that term is primarily used for covert or  clandestine surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://intelnews.org/2008/12/16/04-11/|title=Tallinn government surveillance cameras reveal black bag operation|date=December 16, 2008|work=Intelnews|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] Such operations are known to have been carried out by the FBI,[tpl]cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2007/06/as_part_of_its_/|title=FBI to Boost ‘Black Bag’ Search Ops|last=Rood|first=Justin|date=June 15, 2007|work=ABC News|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] the Central Intelligence Agency,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.matthewaid.com/post/32043919336/the-cia-code-thief-who-came-in-from-the-cold|title=The CIA Code Thief Who Came in from the Cold|work=matthewald.com|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] Mossad, MI6 and the intelligence services of other nations.

[[Principle of legality]]
CATEGORIES: Legal doctrines and principles

The principle of legality is the legal ideal that requires all law to be clear, ascertainable and non-retrospective. It requires decision makers to resolve disputes by applying legal rules that have been declared beforehand, and not to alter the legal situation retrospectively by discretionary departures from established law. It is closely related to legal formalism and the rule of law and can be traced from the writings of Feuerbach, Dicey and Montesquieu.
The principle has particular relevance in criminal and administrative law. In criminal law it can be seen in the general prohibition on the imposition of criminal sanctions for acts or omissions that were not criminal at the time of their commission or omission. The principle is also thought to be violated when the sanctions for a particular crime are increased with retrospective effect.
In administrative law it can be seen in the desire for state officials to be bound by and apply the law rather than acting upon whim. As such advocates of the principle are normally against discretionary powers.
The principle can be varyingly expressed in Latin phrases such as Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali (No crime can be committed, nor punishment imposed without a pre-existing penal law), nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without law) and nullum crimen sine lege (no crime without law).

[[Vince Coleman (train dispatcher)]]

CATEGORIES: 1872 births, 1917 deaths, Canadian humanitarians, Dispatchers, People from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Intercolonial Railway, Canadian Government Railways

Patrick Vincent Coleman (13 March 1872 – 6 December 1917)Nova Scotia Vital Statistics, Birth: Registration Year: 1874 - Book: 1811 - Page: 5 - Number: 92; Death: Registration Year: 1917 - Page: 102 - Number: 613 was a train dispatcher for the Canadian Government Railways (formerly the ICR, Intercolonial Railway of Canada) who was killed in the Halifax Explosion.  Today he is remembered as one of the heroic figures from the disaster.
On the morning of 6 December 1917, the 45-year-old Coleman and Chief Clerk William Lovett were working in the depot station near the foot of Richmond Street, only a few hundred feet from Pier 6. From there, trains were controlled on the mainline into Halifax. The line ran along the western shore of Bedford Basin from Rockingham Station to the city's passenger terminal at the North Street Station, located at the corner of Barrington and North Streets. 
At approximately 8:45 a.m., there was a collision between  SS Mont-Blanc, a French munitions ship carrying a deadly cargo of high explosives, and a Norwegian vessel, SS Imo. Immediately thereafter, Mont-Blanc caught fire and the crew abandoned ship. The vessel drifted from near the mid-channel over to the pier on the slack tide in a matter of minutes and beached herself.Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Edward McCrossan (SS Curacas), Library and Archives Canada.  A sailor, believed to have been sent ashore by a naval officer, warned Coleman and Lovett of her deadly cargo of high explosives.Scapegoat, the extraordinary legal proceedings following the 1917 Halifax Explosion, Joel Zemel (2012), note 80, p. 382. The only naval officer in the vicinity of Pier 6 before and after the collision with knowledge of Mont Blanc's cargo was the port convoy officer, Lieutenant James Anderson Murray (RNCVR), aboard Hilford. The small tug was chartered by the RN's Port Convoy Office under the command of Rear-Admiral Bertram M. Chambers, According to the testimony of Francis Mackey, the pilot of Mont Blanc, (Appeals Book: Imo vs. Mont Blanc), Hilford was close enough to Pier 6 to put a sailor ashore quickly in order to warn people about the nature of the French ship's cargo. The overnight express train No. 10 from Saint John, NB, carrying nearly 300 passengers, was due to arrive at 8:55 a.m. Before leaving the office, Lovett called CGR terminal agent Henry Dustan to warn him of a burning ship laden with explosives that was heading for the pier.Investigation into the Halifax Explosion, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 596 and Appeal Book and other records, RG 42-C-3-a, vol. 597, testimony of Henry Dustan, Library and Archives Canada. After sending his initial message, Coleman and Lovett were said to have left the CGR depot. However, the dispatcher returned to the telegraph office and continued sending warning messages along the rail line as far as Truro to stop trains inbound for Halifax. An accepted version of Coleman's Morse code message reads as follows:
 "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys."[tpl]cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/coleman.html |title=Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion |publisher=Maritime Museum of the Atlantic |date=1917-12-06 |accessdate=2013[/tpl]  
The telegraphed warnings were apparently heeded, as the No. 10 passenger train was stopped just before the explosion occurred. The train was halted at Rockingham Station, on the western shore of Bedford Basin, approximately [tpl]convert|6.4|km|mi[/tpl] from the downtown terminal.  After the explosion, Coleman's message, followed by other messages later sent by railway officials who made their way to Rockingham, passed word of the disaster to the rest of Canada. The railway quickly mobilized aid, sending a dozen relief trains with fire and medical help from towns in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the day of the disaster, followed two days later by help from other parts of Canada and from the United States, most notably Boston.  Even though Lovett had left the station, both he and Coleman were killed in the explosion.*Dan Conlin, "Vincent Coleman and the Halifax Explosion", Maritime Museum of the Atlantic web page; Nova Scotia Vital Statistics. 
Although historians may debate whether Coleman's initial message actually contributed to stopping the No. 10 train, there is documented evidence to indicate it did. No. 10's Conductor Gillespie reported to the Moncton Transcript that although running on time, "his train was held for fifteen minutes by the dispatcher at Rockingham."Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway, Jay Underwood (2005). Vince Coleman was also the subject of a Heritage Minute and a prominent character in the CBC miniseries Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion. The Heritage Minute and other sources contain historical inaccuracies in that Coleman is shown warning others in the area surrounding the depot station of the impending explosion. In truth, the Richmond Station was surrounded by freight yards. Another error is the exaggeration of the number of passengers aboard the Saint John train. It contained a maximum of 300 people, not 700 as claimed in the Heritage Minute.[tpl]cite book|author=Metson, Graham|title=The Halifax Explosion|page=42|publisher=McGraw Hill Ryerson|year=1978[/tpl] The warning message is also changed. Coleman's telegraph key, watch, and pen are on display in the Halifax Explosion exhibit at Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.
Coleman is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Halifax, at the intersection of Mumford Road with Joseph Howe Drive. He was survived by his wife Frances, who lived until 1970.  A street is named after him in the Clayton Park neighbourhood of Halifax and in 2007 a section of Albert Street near his old home was renamed Vincent Street. A condominium near Mount Olivet Cemetery on Bayer's Road is named The Vincent Coleman, also in his honour.

[[Comprehensive National Power]]

CATEGORIES: International relations theory, International security, Foreign relations of China, Chinese words and phrases

Comprehensive National Power (CNP) ([tpl]zh|c=综合国力[/tpl]; pinyin: zōnghé guólì) is a putative measure, important in the contemporary political thought of the People's Republic of China, of the general power of a nation-state. CNP can be calculated numerically by combining various quantitative indices to create a single number held to measure the power of a nation-state. [tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl] These indices take into account both military factors (known as hard power) and economic and cultural factors (known as soft power).  CNP is notable for being an original Chinese political concept with no roots in either contemporary Western political theory, Marxism-Leninism, or pre-20th-century Chinese thinking.
There is a general consensus that the United States is the nation with the highest CNP and that mainland China's CNP ranks not only far behind the United States but also behind the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Germany.  Although some Western assessments of China suggest that China will be able to match or overtake the United States in the 21st century, the most recent Chinese projections of CNP suggest that this outcome is unlikely[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl].
According to Reports on International Politics and Security published in January 2006 in the Yellow Book of International Politics by the Social Sciences Center, a government-sponsored Chinese think-tank, the list of top 10 countries with the highest CNP score were as follows:
Within Chinese political thought, the main goal of the Chinese state is to maximize China's CNP.  The inclusion of economic factors and soft power measures within most CNP indices is intended to prevent China from making the mistake of the Soviet Union in overinvesting in the military at the expense of the civilian economy.
A fairly simplistic and effective index was developed by Chin-Lung Chang.  It uses critical mass, economic capacity and military capacity.  Due to its indicators, it is often repeatable and easy to define, making it comparable to the Human Development Index in understanding and reliability.A Measure of National Power
A new book titled "Comprehensive National Power- A Model for India", which is a project of United Service Institution of India explains how CNP is calculated and also shows various methods of calculation with various tables, charts, diagrams. Comprehensive National Power

CATEGORIES: Cellular automaton patterns

In a cellular automaton, a Garden of Eden configuration is a configuration that cannot appear on the lattice after one time step, no matter what the initial configuration.  In other words, these are the configurations with no predecessors.
They resemble the concept of the Garden of Eden in Abrahamic religions, which was created out of nowhere, hence the name.  According to [tpl]harvtxt|Moore|1962[/tpl], this name was coined by John Tukey in the 1950s.
A Garden of Eden is a configuration of the whole lattice (usually a one- or two-dimensional infinite square lattice).  Each Garden of Eden configuration contains at least one finite pattern (an assignment of states to a finite subset of the cells) that has no predecessor regardless of how the surrounding cells are filled.  Such a pattern is called an orphan.  Alternatively, an orphan is a finite pattern such that each configuration containing that pattern is a Garden of Eden.

[[Simei]]

CATEGORIES: Places in Singapore, Simei

Simei is a housing estate located in the eastern part of Singapore, situated next to Tampines New Town across the Pan-Island Expressway. The name Simei is pinyin for "Four Beauties" in Chinese. Initially, the roads in this area was named after the four great beauties in Chinese history (Xishi, Wang Zhaojun, Diao Chan and Yang Guifei). However, due to difficulties in pronouncing these street names by the non-Chinese ethnicities, the roads were renamed Simei Streets 1 to 4.
Simei is a well-developed estate with plenty of amenities and facilities. There are schools, an MRT station, coffee shops and a shopping mall. East Point Mall is the only shopping mall located here that cater to the needs of the residents, and houses shops such as restaurants, bookstores and music shops which has been closed for renovation which will be completed in 2014.
NTUC Fairprice, a leading hypermarket chain in Singapore, is located outiside the former Eastpoint mall . Cheers and 7-11 are two 24-hour convenience stores located near Simei MRT Station. Simei Park is the only park in Simei, consisting of a playground, elderly fitness corner and running tracks. There are different kinds of residential dwellings in the area, comprising landed properties, condominiums, mansions and public housing flats. For medical needs, Changi General Hospital is located here as well, and serves many Singaporeans living in the eastern area. The buses that serve the Simei estate are SBS Transit bus services 5, 9, 12, 20 and 38. Bus services 2, 10, 17 and 31 also pass through the outskirts of Simei. The current MP serving the Changi Simei constituency is Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo.

[[Rock Against Howard]]
CATEGORIES: Rock albums by Australian artists, Compilation albums by Australian artists, 2004 compilation albums

Rock Against Howard is an Australian compilation CD featuring anti-Coalition musicians, released in 2004. The project hoped to inspire young voters to turn out in federal elections that year to vote against then-Prime Minister John Howard, but Howard's party prevailed all the same.
Rock Against Howard was organised by Frenzal Rhomb guitarist Lindsay McDougall, when he realised every musician he knew felt the same way about Howard. It was inspired by the American Rock Against Bush compilations, and takes on a similar format. All profits from album sales go to refugee charities through the Refugee Action Coalition, an ironic tribute to Howard's stance on asylum seekers.
The music on the release is politically oriented, with the first disk featuring previously released songs, and a disk of live and otherwise previously unreleased work on the second. The style of music varies widely, with punk rock, hip-hop, and even show tunes.

[[List of mayors of Halifax, Nova Scotia]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of mayors of places in Nova Scotia, Mayors of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Government in the Halifax Regional Municipality

This is a list of mayors of the city  Halifax, Nova Scotia. The City of Halifax is a former municipality in Nova Scotia which was amalgamated with the City of Dartmouth Town of Bedford and Halifax County to form the Halifax Regional Municipality in 1996.
This is a list of mayors for the City of Halifax from 1841 until amalgamation.  Prior to the formation of the city's elected government in 1841 the administration of the municipality was left in the hands of a selected group of men.  The first mayor was elected to council and chosen for this position by his peers in council.
Prior 1850 the Mayor was elected amongst the elected councillors. The first Mayor elected directly by citizens was William Caldwell. The Mayor continues to act as a Councillor-at-Large and has a direct vote on all council decisions.

[[PRR N1s]]

CATEGORIES: ALCO locomotives, Baldwin locomotives, 2-10-2 locomotives, Pennsylvania Railroad locomotives, Steam locomotives of the United States, Scrapped locomotives, Freight locomotives

The Pennsylvania Railroad's N1s was a class of steam locomotive built for Lines West.  They were of 2-10-2 "Santa Fe" wheel arrangement, ten driving wheels with a two-wheel leading truck and a two-wheel cast KW-pattern trailing truck under a giant firebox.  This arrangement was well suited to the N1s' intended purpose, which was as a heavy drag freight engine for coal and iron ore traffic to and from lakeside ports. The design was developed by the PRR's Fort Wayne Shops and orders were placed with Alco (Brooks) (35 locomotives) and Baldwin (25 locomotives) for a total of 60; the first Alco locomotive was delivered in December 1918, with the remainder arriving during 1919.
The N1s was a large locomotive; the boiler was the largest then used on any non-experimental PRR locomotive, with a large Belpaire firebox with [tpl]convert|79.9|sqft|m2|1[/tpl] of grate area and a [tpl]convert|5|ft|m|2|adj=on[/tpl] long combustion chamber.  No feedwater heater was fitted, but a mechanical stoker and power reverse were, necessities on such a large locomotive.  Boiler pressure was [tpl]convert|215|psi|MPa|2[/tpl], although  it was designed to take a pressure of [tpl]convert|250|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on[/tpl].
To allow the locomotive to negotiate tight 23-degree curves, the first and fifth driving axles were fitted with lateral motion devices and the center axle was blind.  
In many respects, the N1s was similar in ability to the I1s 2-10-0 "Decapod".  Driver diameter, weight on drivers and cylinder size were almost identical.  The N1s' boiler was larger, but of a lower pressure.  The I1s' tractive effort was a little higher, while the N1s had a superior factor of adhesion.  The N1s, as a low-speed drag hauler, was limited to [tpl]convert|35|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], while the I1s was capable of [tpl]convert|50|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or greater.
The N1s were the first class of large power withdrawn after diesel locomotives appeared; all were gone by 1950, and none were saved for display.  Their task, low-speed drag haulage, was the diesel locomotive's forte.

As the largest ethnic group in Singapore is Chinese, Chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was. (Note: The name Chinatown  is given by the British and today usually used by non-Chinese Singaporeans, whereas Chinese Singaporeans usually use the term Niu Che Shui as the term Chinatown usually refers to enclaves of Chinese people in regions where Chinese people are the minority ethnic group.)

Leonard Arthur Kitz QC (April 9, 1916 – January 30, 2006) was the first Jewish mayor of Halifax, Nova Scotia (1955–1957). 
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Harry and Yetta (Lesser) Kitz, he grew up with older sister Hildred Kitz (Silver) and younger brother Joe. He attended Halifax's Protestant school system (there being no state-supported school for non-Christians) and graduated from the Halifax Academy. He attended Dalhousie University, where he studied law, graduating from Dalhousie Law School in 1938. 
With World War II breaking out in Europe in 1939, Kitz joined the Canadian Army becoming an infantry officer in the Princess Louise Fusiliers. During the war, he served in Italy and Holland. After the war he served as a lawyer in military tribunals.
While serving in England in 1945, Kitz met and married Dr. Alice Duff Findlay. The two returned to Halifax after the war where Kitz opened his own law firm, located on Granville Street. His law firm was eventually joined by Robert Matheson becoming Matheson and Kitz. Kitz served as President of the Nova Scotia Barristers Association from 1968-1969.
In 1948, Kitz decided to enter politics and he was elected an alderman in Halifax. He served as an alderman from 1948-1955.   Kitz is most remembered for his part as the 'driving force' behind the funding and construction of a statue of Winston Churchill which is a landmark on Halifax's Spring Garden Road.
Kitz was re-elected in 1956 but two years later resigned the mayorship to run, unsuccessfully, as a Liberal for parliament in the federal riding of Halifax.
Kitz' first wife died in 1969. He remarried in 1971 to Janet Brownlee. Janet is a renowned historian of the Halifax Explosion and the author of a number of books on the subject.

[[Security dilemma]]
CATEGORIES: International security, International relations theory, Political realism, Security studies, Dilemmas

The security dilemma, also referred to as the spiral model, is a term used in international relations and refers to a situation in which actions by a state intended to heighten its security, such as increasing its military strength or making alliances, can lead other states to respond with similar measures, producing increased tensions that create conflict, even when no side really desires it.Jervis, R. "Cooperation under the Security Dilemma," World Politics vol. 30, no.2 (January 1978), pp. 167–174; and Jervis, R. Perception and Misperception in International Politics (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 58–113
The term was coined by the German scholar John H. Herz in his 1951 book Political Realism and Political Idealism. At the same time British historian Herbert Butterfield described the same situation in his History and Human Relations, but referred to it as the "absolute predicament and irreducible dilemma."Roe, Paul. The Intrastate Security Dilemma: Ethnic Conflict as a 'Tragedy'? Journal of Peace Research vol. 36, no. 2 (Mar., 1999), pp. 183–202. In John Herz's words, the security dilemma is "A structural notion in which the self-help attempts of states to look after their security needs tend, regardless of intention, to lead to rising insecurity for others as each interprets its own measures as defensive and measures of others as potentially threatening."Herz, J. "Idealist Internationalism and the Security Dilemma", World Politics vol. 2, no. 2 (1950): 171–201, at p. 157 (Published by Cambridge University Press)
A frequently cited example of the security dilemma is the beginning of World War I. Supporters of this viewpoint argue that the major European powers felt forced to go to war by feelings of insecurity over the alliances of their neighbors, despite not actually desiring the war. Furthermore, Germany's fear of fighting war on two fronts led it to the formulation of the infamous Schlieffen Plan, which specified a particularly accelerated mobilization timetable. The onset of German mobilization, in turn, put pressure on other states to start mobilizing early as well. However, other scholars dispute this interpretation of the origins of the war, contending that some of the states involved really did want the conflict.
The security dilemma is a popular concept with cognitive and international relations theorists, who regard war as essentially arising from failures of communication. Functionalist theorists affirm that the key to avoiding war is the avoidance of miscommunication through proper signaling.
The security dilemma has important relationships with other theories and doctrines of international security. Part of the strength of the security dilemma theory is that it subsumes and is consistent with a number of other theories. Other theories can be considered in terms of the security dilemma.

The Southern Expressway is the world's longest reversible one way freeway, although the expressway is currently being turned into a regular 2-direction freeway.  Originally proposed as 'Noarlunga Freeway', it was built as a corridor to relieve heavy traffic from the major arterial, Main South Road, in Adelaide's south. The expressway was built in two stages — the first completed in late 1997, the second in 2001. The total cost of the arterial was A$76.5m, and it is 21 km in total length.  Main South Road provides both the start and finish. There are exits at Marion Road, Panalatinga Road, Sherriffs Road and Beach Road. The Southern Expressway is signed as M2.
Construction of the expressway also included the Adelaide Southern Veloway for cyclists, which runs alongside it for 7 km, from Marion/Main South Road to the Panalatinga Tunnel. South of the Panalatinga Tunnel, the bikeway becomes a shared track for the remaining 12 km of the expressway. The expressway crosses over the Coast to Vines rail trail at both Panalatinga Road and at the expressway's Southern end.

Internet Explorer for Mac (also referred to as Internet Explorer for Macintosh, Internet Explorer Macintosh Edition, Internet Explorer:mac or IE:mac) was a proprietary web browser developed by Microsoft for the Macintosh platform. Initial versions were developed from the same code base as Internet Explorer for Windows. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of version 5 which included the Tasman layout engine.
As a result of the five-year agreement between Apple and Microsoft in 1997, it was the default browser on Mac OS and Mac OS X from 1998 until it was replaced by Apple's own Safari web browser in 2003 with the release of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.
On June 13, 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was released on July 11, 2003. The browser was not included in the default installation of Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger" which was released on April 29, 2005. Microsoft discontinued support for the product on December 31, 2005 and removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site on January 31, 2006.

The Pennsylvania Railroad's class I1s steam locomotives were the largest class of 2-10-0 "Decapods" in the United States, with 598 built 1916–1923 (Altoona: 123,  Baldwin: 475). They were the dominant freight locomotive on the system until World War II, and they remained in service until the end of PRR steam in 1957. Nicknames for the type included Decs and Hippos, the latter due to the large boiler. Unlike smaller 2-10-0s that preceded them, the I1s design was huge, taking advantage of the PRR's heavy trackage and high allowed axle load, with a wide, free-steaming boiler. Large cylinders enabled the I1s to apply that power to the rails. Their power was undeniable, but they were not popular with the crews, for they were hard riding at all but low speeds. One author described them as the holy terror of the PRR. The large boiler limited the size of the driving wheels, which made it impossible to mount counterweights large enough to balance the piston thrusts. Their factor of adhesion is low, so they were prone to slipping.
Subclass I1sa increased maximum steam cut-off to admit steam for 78% of the piston stroke (rather than the original 50%), boosting low speed tractive effort from [tpl]convert|90000|to|96000|lbf|kN[/tpl]. There was no obvious external difference except for a revised builders' plate (and of course the revised combination lever). I1s locomotives were converted to I1sa during major overhaul; eventually 489 were converted while 109 remained as built.
In 1923 PRR put engine 4358 on the Altoona test plant. The tests below were all stoker fired.

Rancho Park is a small residential neighborhood in the Westside of the city of Los Angeles, California with mostly single family homes and tree lined streets. The community is nestled between West Los Angeles and Cheviot Hills. This enclave draws young professionals and families and is home to residents working in a variety of professional occupations. History proves the neighborhood was once a part of Westwood until Olympic Blvd. was placed dividing the area North and South. The Southern section, now known as Rancho Park, felt cut off from its North side lobbying for its own identity in the 1930s.

[[Harpagophytum]]

CATEGORIES: Lamiales, Plants used in traditional African medicine

Harpagophytum, also called grapple plant, wood spider and most commonly devil's claw, is a genus of  plants in the sesame family, native to southern Africa. It owes to common name devil's claw to the peculiar appearance of its hooked fruit. The plant's large tuberous roots are used medicinally to reduce pain and fever, and to stimulate digestion. European colonists brought devil's claw home where it was used to treat arthritis.
Harpagophytum procumbens is mainly found in the eastern and south eastern parts of Namibia, Southern Botswana and the Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa. Harpagophytum zeyheri is found in the northern parts of Namibia (Ovamboland) and southern Angola. The active ingredient is harpagoside (structure at PubChem http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=5281542&loc=ec_rcs) with values ranging in both species from 1.0% to 3.3%.
The name "devil's claw" is also used for several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea, as well as Urtica dioica and certain species of Pisonia.

Oscar R. Panno (born March 1935 in Buenos Aires) is an Argentine chess Grandmaster.
Panno won the first World Junior Chess Championship in 1953, ahead of such future strong Grandmasters as Borislav Ivkov, Bent Larsen, and Fridrik Olafsson.  He also won the championship of Argentina the same year.
He became a grandmaster at the age of twenty. He had an Elo rating of around 2580 in his prime, and of 2515 in 1986 and 2429 in 2008. Chessmetrics.com, which attempts to rank players from before the introduction of FIDE ratings, estimates that he was as high as 18th in the world in late 1955. He competed in five interzonal tournaments, with his greatest success coming at Göteborg 1955.  In a field of 21 players, Panno finished clear third, only half a point out of second and ahead of such players as Efim Geller, Tigran Petrosian, and Boris Spassky. (He beat future World Champion Spassky in their individual game.) This result was probably the peak of his career, as it advanced him to the 1956 Candidates tournament in Amsterdam, the winner of which would play a 24 game match for the World Championship with Mikhail Botvinnik. However, his form from the interzonal did not carry over and he finished in a tie for 8th-9th in a ten man field. Panno has several successes at the tournaments at Mar del Plata. He won the international tournaments in 1954 and 1969 (shared with Miguel Najdorf), and the open tournaments in 1986, 1988, and 1994. Panno tied for first at Lone Pine 1977. He played various famous grandmasters, occasionally losing to them. Panno was the first top world chess player born in South America. He played eleven times for Argentina in Chess Olympiads (1954–58, 1962, 1966–70, 1976, 1986–88, 1992).Men's Chess Olympiads: Oscar Panno The 1954 Olympiad team won the Silver medal, while the 1958 and 1962 teams won the Bronze medal. He was still active as of 2008, finishing third in the Bobby Fischer Memorial tournament held in Villa Martelli. In addition to his win over Boris Spassky in 1955, he also beat him at the 1976 Manila interzonal.

[[Yongsan District]]
CATEGORIES: Yongsan District

Yongsan District (Yongsan-gu) is a district of Seoul, South Korea. Its name means "Dragon Hill", derived from the hanja characters for dragon (龍 yong) and hill/mountain (山 san). It sits to the north of the Han River under the shadow of Seoul Tower. Geographically, it is located right in the center of Seoul. It is home to roughly 250,000 people, and is divided into 20 dong, or neighborhoods.  Notable locations in Yongsan District include Yongsan Station, the sprawling Yongsan Electronics Market, Haebangchon and the Itaewon commercial district.  Itaewon is widely known as one of the most ethnically diverse regions in Korea.  Many foreigners gravitate towards its shopping centers and nightlife.
Yongsan District is also the site of Yongsan Garrison, a large United States military base in the heart of Seoul. Because of the scarcity of land in central Seoul, as well as the consolidation of U.S. Forces throughout the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. and South Korean governments have agreed to relocate the facility out of Seoul to Pyeongtaek by 2017. After its relocation, the 243 ha of its land is planned to be developed into a large park.
Sookmyung Women's University is located in the western portion of this district.  Nearby, the legendary bar "Doors" has been a hub of Sookmyung social life for years. There is also a growing community of Muslims and others from the Middle East due to the location of Seoul's only mosque, Seoul Central Mosque in Itaewon. This immigration trend has caused a number of halal restaurants and shops to open in the area.
N Seoul Tower has been re-opened.  The tower is situated at the top of Namsan.  The tower was built as a television transmitter.
Yongsan is served by Seoul Subway Line 1, Line 4, Line 6, and the Jungang Line.

USS ''Lizardfish'' (SS-373), a Balao-class submarine, was a boat of the United States Navy named for the lizardfish, a slender marine fish having a scaly, lizard-like head and large mouth.
Lizardfish (SS-373) was laid down 14 March 1944 by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, WI; launched 16 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Lansdale G. Sasscer; wife of Congressman Sasscer of Maryland; and commissioned 30 December 1944, Cmdr. Ovid M. Butler in command. 
Lizardfish departed the Manitowoc River 20 January 1945 for Lockport, IL, where she was loaded on a floating drydock and towed down the Mississippi River. She arrived at Algiers, La., 1 February and put to sea 5 days later for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 March. 
Lizardfish left Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 9 April 1945. Topping off with fuel at Saipan on the 21st, she set course for the South China Sea. The submarine maintained a thorough close-in patrol of Indochina between 30 April and 18 May, but contacted no enemy traffic. From 23 to 28 May, a similar painstaking patrol in the Java Sea produced no enemy contacts. Completing this arduous patrol, Lizardfish arrived Fremantle, Australia, on 2 June.
Lizardfish got underway 28 June 1945 on her second patrol in the Java and South China Seas. Throughout this patrol, the submarine sought out targets and carried destruction to the enemy in confined harbors, straits, and anchorages. After careful submerged reconnaissance, she made two daring daylight gun attacks within range of shore batteries. 
On 5 July, she entered the coral-fringed bay of Chelukan Bawang, Bali, discovering four landing barges, a 250-ton sea truck, and a 100-ton submarine chaser, all heavily camouflaged. She made a submerged run and sank Submarine Chaser Alo. 37, then battle-surfaced and opened her deck guns. Her [tpl]convert|5|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] salvos started a gasoline fire which destroyed a nest of four landing barges. She then demolished a boat shed and ripped apart the bow of a sea truck inside. Leaving this target in a flaming mass, she headed out to sea. 
On 19 July near Sunda Strait, she was patrolling southward along the western shore when her crew sighted a convoy of sea trucks. The submarine surfaced and commenced firing at the closest target, started a brisk fire, and shifted targets. Meanwhile a shore battery opened up and was lobbing shells close by. When ammunition was expended, Lizardfish submerged, leaving behind three ships burning fiercely. She surfaced that night and headed for lifeguard station off Singapore in support of Army B-24Liberator bomber strikes. The submarine arrived Subic Bay, Philippines, on 6 August and was there when Japan capitulated 9 days later.
Lizardfish received one battle star for World War II service.
Lizardfish cleared Subic Bay on 31 August and set course for the West Coast, touched Pearl Harbor, and arrived San Francisco on 22 September. At Eureka, CA, 24 October for Navy Day celebrations, Lizardfish five days later tied up at Tiburon, CA, remaining there until 2 January 1946, when she got underway to act as schoolship for the Sonar School at San Diego. She completed her training services on 5 March and reported for inactivation at San Francisco. After operations off the California coast, she was decommissioned, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Mare Island Navy Yard, on 24 June 1946.

The [tpl]nihongo|Taft–Katsura Agreement|桂・タフト協定|Katsura-Tafuto Kyōtei|extra=also known as the Taft Katsura Memorandum|lead=yes[/tpl] was a 1905 discussion  between senior leaders of Japan and the United States regarding the positions of the two nations in greater East Asian affairs, especially regarding the status of Korea and Philippines in the aftermath of Japan's victory in the Russo Japanese War.
The Japanese stated its reasons for its protectorate of Korea, and repeated that it had no interest in the Philippines. The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish American War of 1898. In 1924, historian Tyler Dennett described the memorandum of the conversation as containing "the text of perhaps the most remarkable 'executive agreement' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States".President Roosevelt's Secret Pact with Japan, Tyler Dennett, The Current History Magazine, October, 1924, http://www.icasinc.org/history/katsura.html Other historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new. The "agreement" in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both covered the substance of the conversations between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan (Count) Katsura Tarō on 27 July 1905.THE TAFT-KATSURA AGREEMENT, Steven J. Bucklin, Professor of Department of History, University of South Dakota, http://people.usd.edu/~sbucklin/primary/taftkatsura.htm President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position.
When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant "secret pact" between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers. The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States, and maintaining peace between them, in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War.
Some Korean historians have assumed that, in the discussions, the United States recognized Japan's sphere of influence in Korea; in exchange, Japan recognized the United States's sphere of influence in the Philippines.  However, American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made—the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement.  They both restated the well-known official policies of their own governments. Indeed, Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government (Taft was Secretary of War, not Secretary of State).[tpl]Cite journal |first=Raymond A. |last=Esthus |title=The Taft-Katsura Agreement—Reality or Myth? |journal=Journal of Modern History |year=1959 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=46–51 |jstor=1871772 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |author=Jongsuk Chay |title=The Taft-Katsura Memorandum Reconsidered |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=1968 |pages=321–326 |doi= |jstor=3636866 [/tpl]

[[Janner]]

CATEGORIES: English language in England, Languages of the United Kingdom, Plymouth, Devon, Pejorative terms for people, Regional nicknames

Janner is an English regional nickname associated with people from Plymouth both as a noun and as an adjective for the local accent and colloquialisms. In 1987 Cyril Tawney, in his book Grey Funnel Lines, described its meaning as "a person from Devon", deriving from Cousin Jan (the Devon form of John), but "more particularly in naval circles anyone from the Plymouth area".Grey Funnel Lines: Traditional Song & Verse of the Royal Navy, 1900-1970, Cyril Tawney, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1987 ISBN 978-0-7102-1270-2
With the changes in the local economy in Plymouth over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, from the Royal Navy being the major employer to being a university city housing a large number of students from outside the city, the term has developed an additional secondary pejorative sense describing the locals.[tpl]cn|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The Member of Parliament for Plymouth, Devonport, Alison Seabeck, showed her ignorance of the term in 2005 when, while still a candidate, she was asked by the local paper: "What is a Janner?" The Express on Sunday reported her reply:  The flustered candidate wailed: "I don't know. You're not going to print this, are you?" Unfortunately they did. The answer is a "Plymothian".
For many years there was a cartoon in the Plymouth Evening Herald entitled 'The Janners'.  Many pamphlets circulate with mischievous amusing and sometimes erotic anthologies and there are short dictionaries of Janner vocabulary, e.g. the Janner TextBook.[ref]This example is at 
[/ref]
The term features in the football team Plymouth Argyle supporters' chants, particularly its variant on the folksong Oggy Land,151 Plymouth chants Footballchants.org and in 2010 it was used in a television advertisement for Aviva Car Insurance in which Paul Whitehouse as a Plymouth Argyle supporter driving to an away match exhorts a potential passenger to "get on you janner".Janner reference in television advertisement for Aviva Car Insurance via YouTube[ref]

[[Fick principle]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiology, Anesthesia

Developed by Adolf Eugen Fick (1829–1901), the Fick principle has been applied to the measurement of cardiac output. Its underlying principles may also be applied in a variety of clinical situations.
The essence of the Fick principle is that blood flow to an organ can be calculated using a marker substance if the following information is known:
In Fick's original method, the "organ" was the entire human body and the marker substance was oxygen.
The principle may be applied in different ways. For example, if the blood flow to an organ is known, together with the arterial and venous concentrations of the marker substance, the uptake of marker substance by the organ may then be calculated.

[[Capoeira music]]

CATEGORIES: Capoeira, Brazilian styles of music

In capoeira, music sets the rhythm, the style of play, and the energy of a game.
In its most traditional setting, there are three main styles of song that weave together the structure of the capoeira roda. The roda represents the most strict and traditional format for capoeira and is ideally suited for an introduction and discussion of the music. Though we may consider the music traditional, because it has been passed orally from one to the next until the early - mid 20th century when songs and rhythms began to be notated and recorded, there is no record of to what extent and exactly how the music has evolved over time. Capoeira's Brazilian heritage plays a heavy role in the way capoeira is perceived by its practitioners and understood at a subconscious level. It is a common feature of many Brazilian ethnic groups, for instance, as well as others throughout the world, that music is not so much a form of personal entertainment as it is a medium to bring about group cohesion and dynamic. Music in the context of capoeira is used to create a sacred space through both the physical act of forming a circle (the roda) and an aural space that is believed to connect to the spirit world. This deeper religious significance exists more as a social memory to most capoeira groups, but is generally understood as evidenced in the use of ngoma drums (the atabaques of Yoruba candomblé), the berimbau whose earlier forms were used in rituals in Africa and the diaspora in speaking with ancestors, the ever-present term axé which signifies life force, the invocation of both Afro-Brazilian and Catholic spirituality, and certain semi-ritualized movements used in Capoeira Angola that bring "spiritual protection".
The instruments are:

up to 3 berimbaus

up to 2 pandeiros

1 agogô

1 reco-reco (notched wooden tube similar to a guiro)

1 atabaque or conga

Not every roda will contain all these instruments. Mestre Bimba, for instance, preferred only one berimbau and two pandeiros in his rodas, but there will always be at least one berimbau in any roda.
The berimbaus preside over the roda, their rhythmic combinations suggesting variations in movement style between the two players in the roda.  Some capoeira groups insist that among the three berimbaus, the lowest-toned (called a gunga or berraboi) is the lead instrument, while other groups follow the lead of the middle (medio or viola) berimbau.  The roda begins and ends at the discretion of the lead berimbau player, who may determine who plays next, can stop games, set the tempo of the music, and calm the players if they get too rough.  There appears to be agreement that the treble-most berimbau (viola or violinha) is an accompaniment instrument, freely improvising based on rhythms of the middle instrument.

Cosme Damián de Churruca y Elorza (born in Mutriku, 27 September 1761; died at the Battle of Trafalgar, 21 October 1805) was a  Spanish noble, an Admiral of the Royal Spanish Armada, a scientist and Major of Mutriku, who died at the Battle of Trafalgar while commanding the ship of the line San Juan Nepomuceno.
He received his early years education in the Seminary of Burgos. Then, he entered the School of Bergara.
Once he finished his studies, he joined the Naval Academy of Cadiz in 1776, and got his degree in the Naval Academy of Ferrol in 1778, becoming a naval officer.
In 1781, Cosme Damián de Churruca, as an officer of the Spanish Navy, performed heroically in a siege of Gibraltar.
In 1805, a few months before his death, Churruca married María Dolores Ruiz de Apodaca, niece of Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, in 1797. Doña María was only 19 when Churruca died.
He commanded the 74-gun San Juan Nepomuceno in the Battle of Trafalgar, when a cannonball caused him injuries that cost him his life. It seems that he made true the words he said before the battle:

Churruca, whose leg had been torn off by a cannonball, the deck of his ship covered by the blood of his wounded and dead seamen, continued to voice the command "fire". After Trafalgar, the ship was taken into British service as HMS San Juan and served as a supply hulk for many years at Gibraltar. In honour of Churruca's courage, the cabin he had occupied while alive bore his name on a brass plate, and all who entered it were required to remove their hats as a mark of respect for a gallant enemy.Harbron, John D.

The Espelette pepper (French: Piment d'Espelette [tpl]IPA-fr|pi.mɑ̃ dɛs.pə.lɛt[/tpl] ; Basque: Ezpeletako biperra) is a variety of chili pepper that is cultivated in the French commune of Espelette, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, traditionally the northern territory of the Basque people.Larousse, p. 92. On 1 June 2000, it was classified as an AOC product and was confirmed as an APO product on 22 August 2002.
The plant, originally from Mexico and to a lesser extent South America, was introduced into France from the New World during the 16th century. After first being used medicinally, it subsequently became popular for preparing condiments and for the conservation of meat and ham. It is now a cornerstone of Basque cuisine, where it has gradually replaced black pepper and it is a key ingredient in piperade.Larousse, p. 804. 
AOC espelette peppers are cultivated in the following communes: Ainhoa, Cambo-les-Bains, Espelette, Halsou, Itxassou, Jatxou, Larressore, Saint-Pée-sur-Nivelle, Souraïde, and Ustaritz. It is harvested in late summer and, in September, characteristic festoons of pepper are hung on balconies and house walls throughout the communes to dry out. An annual pepper festival, attracting some 20,000 tourists[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl], is held in October.
This pepper attains only a grade of 4,000 on the Scoville scale and therefore can be considered not hot. It can be purchased as festoons of fresh or dried peppers, as ground pepper, or puréed or pickled in jars.

It sits astride the junction of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and Coventry Canal; at Fazeley Junction are a couple of multi storey mills. Fazeley is also adjacent to Drayton Manor, formerly the home of Robert Peel and now a theme park and zoo.
Fazeley also sits astride the old Roman road of Watling Street, which is now much quieter following the move of the A5 road to run on a new course between Fazeley and Tamworth.
Fazeley has two primary schools, Millfield County Primary School and Longwood Primary School, in Mile Oak.  Millfield was built in Victorian times and part of the original building still remains.
The First Annual Fazeley Festival and Mile Oak Mile Charity hop took place on 15 September 2007.
Sitting in the centre of Fazeley, the Town Hall opened in 1898 and was named the Victoria Memorial Hall, commemorating the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria, and James Eadie paid for both the cost of its construction, £3,000, and the land on which it stands, having signalled his intentions in this respect in 1896.
James Eadie intended that the Hall should benefit the inhabitants of Fazeley and help to promote their welfare.  His vision was that the Hall would be used for public meetings, lectures and concerts and contain reading rooms.  He even speculated that technical classes might some day be held “for the better training of workmen in their several crafts and industries.”
This vision became a reality, meetings of all descriptions took place and winter entertainments were regularly well attended.  There was a library and a reading room, classes were held in gymnastics and cookery, and an Evening Continuation School in horticulture attracted over 40 youngsters.  In later years, silent movies were presented here, too.
Today, the Town Hall is used for both public and private events including, bingo, dancing, parties and carpet sales and Fazeley Town Council holds its meetings in the building.
The name Fazeley in its various spellings is found in documents dating back to 1135.  All suggestions concerning its derivation propose that it comes from early Saxon language most take its meaning to be pasture land or pleasant pasture but another authority suggests it is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon faresleia which meant bulls pasture.  The various spellings support this latter suggestion and certainly the land alongside the River Tame, being very flat, may well have been used for this purpose.

Before the recent reform of the House of Lords, all peers were (potentially) members of the House of Lords, and all were Lords Temporal in this sense. The ongoing reforms limit membership in the Lords to life peers and a number of elected hereditary peers.
The Lords Temporal are all members of the Peerage. Formerly, they were all hereditary peers. The right of some hereditary peers to sit in Parliament was not automatic: after Scotland and England united into Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that all peers whose dignities had been created by English Kings could sit in Parliament, but those whose dignities had been created by Scottish Kings were to elect a limited number of "representative peers". A similar arrangement was made in respect of the Ireland when that nation merged with Great Britain in 1801, but when the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom in 1922, the election of Irish representative peers ceased. By the Peerage Act 1963, the election of Scottish representative peers also ended, and all Scottish peers were granted the right to sit in Parliament. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, only life peerages automatically entitle their holders to seats in the House of Lords. Of the hereditary peers, only 92--the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and 90 elected by other peers--retain their seats in the House.

[[Echobelly]]
CATEGORIES: Britpop groups, English rock music groups, English pop music groups, Musical groups established in 1992, Musical groups disestablished in 2004

Echobelly were a Britpop band, debuting in 1994 with their album Everyone's Got One. They were often compared to Blondie and were influenced by Morrissey, who himself was a fan of the group.
The most prominent part of Echobelly's success formula was vocalist Sonya Madan, who was also the group's primary lyricist. Born in Delhi, India, before moving to England at the age of two, Madan had an unusual background for a pop star. Her rigid upbringing made rock music taboo for her as a youngster, and she did not attend her first rock concert until she was in college. In 1990 she met Glenn Johansson, a guitarist from Sweden who was pursuing a career in music. Johansson had previously edited a Swedish pornographic magazine called Eros, which may have contributed to the band's focus on sexual issues in many of their songs. He and Madan dated for a while, then remained friends after breaking up.

[[Michel Sardou]]

CATEGORIES: 1947 births, Living people, Musicians from Paris, French male singers

Michel Sardou (born 26 January 1947) is a French singer.
He was born in Paris, the son of Fernand Sardou and Jackie Rollin (Jackie Sardou). He is the grandson of the dramatist Victorien Sardou,http://www.clubsardou.com/clubms.php?page=biot&b=11&lang=fr as well as father of the French novelist Romain Sardou and the actor Davy Sardou.
He is known not only for his love songs ("La Maladie d'Amour"), but also for songs dealing with various social and political issues, such as the rights of women in Islamic countries, clerical celibacy, colonialism and the death penalty. Another sometimes controversial theme found in some of his songs ("Les Ricains" and "Monsieur le Président de France" for example) is his respect and support for the culture and foreign policies of the United States. He has been accused of being a racist due to his 1976 song : Le temps des colonies where he sang positively about colonialism and slavery. He has focused his full attention on his homeland, ignoring the prospect of an international audience, although his 1981 single "Les Lacs du Connemara" did manage to become a big international hit. A number of his hit songs were written in collaboration with Jacques Revaux, a few others (most notably "En
Chantant") with Italian singer Toto Cutugno.
Even in the 21st century, Michel Sardou remains quite popular in France, selling out 18 consecutive dates at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in 2001, while his 2004 album "Du plaisir" went straight to the no. 1 spot on the French album charts.
He has been married three times; first (1965–1977) to a dancer Françoise Pettré, the mother of his daughters Sandrine (born 1970) and Cynthia (born 1973); then (1977–1998) to Elizabeth "Babette" Haas, the mother of his sons Romain (born 1974) who is a writer and Davy (born 1978) who is a comedian; and lastly to a lifelong friend Anne-Marie Périer (the daughter of the actor François Périer) who was the editor of the French version of Elle magazine.

The Square Club for writers was a monthly dining club that met in London, from 1908/9 to about 1913/4, and included many of the established younger-generation authors. The founders included Edward Garnett, G. K. Chesterton and Conal O'Riordan. It was just one of a number of similar London groups (Garnett had another Soho circle that was distinct); it was perhaps the most substantial such grouping of its time, with a concentration of those enjoying professional success. The name was for Mr. Square, the philosopher character in Henry Fielding's Tom Jones.
Others who participated included J. D. Beresford, Walter de la Mare, John Galsworthy, W. H. Hudson, Roger Ingpen, Edgar Jepson, Arthur Machen, John Masefield, and Edward Thomas. Ezra Pound on arriving in London found it easy to make contacts through the club, but less easy to convince those there through his flamboyance.

His wife, whose name is recorded as Bogwa (보과, 寶菓), was a daughter of the governor of Daifang commandery.  This marital alliance contributed to friction between the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo and Baekje, after Goguryeo attacked Daifang in 286 and Chaekgye sent troops to Daifang's aid.  Chaekgye fortified the Wiryeseong, Acha Mountain Fortress and Sa-seong to defend the Han River valley against expected retaliation.
In 298, Baekje was invaded by Maek-in (맥인, 貊人, probably referring to Dongye) and the Lelang commandery, and Chaekgye was killed.

In August 1991 they issued their debut extended play, Whirled, which included the track, "Labour of Love".

Johann Friedrich Adam, later called Michael Friedrich Adams (1780 in Moscow – 1 March 1838, in Vereya) was a botanist from St. Petersburg, Russia.
He studied from 1795–1796 in the medical school of St. Petersburg. In the years 1800-1802 he traveled across Transcaucasia in the entourage of Count Apollo Mussin-Pushkin (1760-1805). In 1805, he was part of a scientific team attached to the unsuccessful diplomatic mission of Count Yury Golovkin to China. After the failure of the mission, he and many of the other scientists stayed on in Siberia to pursue their researches. In 1806, while in Yakutsk, he heard about an intact woolly mammoth carcass near the mouth of the Lena River. He hastily arranged an expedition to the location where he was able to recover most of the skeleton, skin, and almost forty pounds of hair.

Flugan (The Fly) was an early aeroplane designed and built by Carl Richard Nyberg outside his home in Lidingö, Sweden. Construction started in 1897 and he kept working on it until 1922. The craft only managed a few short jumps and Nyberg was often ridiculed, however several of his innovations are still in use.Sundbybergs Museum He was the first to test his design in a wind tunnel and the first to build a hangar.Arlanda Flygsamlingar The reasons for failure include poor wing and propeller design and, allegedly, that he was afraid of heights.
The Flugan had a wingspan of 5 meters, and the surface area of the wings was 13 m². It was powered by a steam engine heated by four blowtorches (UK: blowlamps) and it produced 10 hp (7 kW) at 2000 rpm. The power-to-weight ratio was actually better than the Wright engine. The total weight of the plane was 80 kg. The weight of the engine was 18 kg.

[[Yokozawa Shōgen]]

CATEGORIES: Samurai, Japanese Roman Catholics, Year of death unknown, Year of birth unknown

[tpl]Nihongo|Yokozawa Shōgen|横沢将監[/tpl] was a Japanese samurai of the sixteenth century, who served Date Masamune, ruler of the Sendai domain.
In September 1616, under an order by Date Masamune, Yokozawa went to Mexico on the San Juan Bautista in order to fetch his compatriot Hasekura Rokuemon who was coming back from an embassy to Europe.
His trip proved difficult, and around one hundred men on the ship died en route. He arrived in Acapulco in May 1617. He remitted a letter and some merchandise from Date Masamune, and was baptized, receiving the name of Don Alonzo Hacaldo.
The ship sailed in April 1618 for a fourth trans-Pacific travel, and arrived in the Philippines, where she was bought by the local Spanish government in order to "reinforce defenses against Holland forces by all means possible". Luis Sotelo chose to remain in the Philippines due to the worsening anti-Christian situation in Japan, but Yokozawa Shogen managed to leave for Japan together with Hasekura Rokuemon on a trade ship in August 1620.
After his arrival in Japan, Yokozawa is recorded to have renounced the Christian faith and burnt all his Christian-related belongings.
In 1621 however, Yokozawa Shogen is known to have signed a letter to the Pope together with seventeen other Christians from Northern Japan. His name comes in second place after Goto Juan (後藤寿庵).http://www.isn.ne.jp/~ym/miyagi/syogen.html#syogen. Retrieved 15 April 2007

Willehad or Willihad (Latin Willehadus; c. 745 – 8 November 789) was a Christian missionary and the Bishop of Bremen from 787.
Willehad was born in Northumbria and probably received his education at York under Ecgbert. A friend of Alcuin he was ordained after his education and, about the year 766, he went to Frisia, preaching at Dokkum and in Overijssel,Butler, Alban. the Lives of the Saints, Vol. XI, 1866 to continue the missionary work of Boniface who had been martyred by the Frisians in 754. At an assembly in Paderborn in 777, Saxony was divided into missionary zones. The zone between the Weser and the Elbe, called Wigmodia, was given to Willehad.[tpl]sfn|McKitterick|1983|p=61[/tpl]
From 780 he preached in the region of the lower Weser River on commission from Charlemagne.  He barely escaped with his life when the Frisians wanted to kill him as well and he returned to the area around Utrecht.  Once again he and his fellow missionaries barely escaped with their lives when the local pagans wanted to kill them for destroying some temples. Finally, in 780, Charlemagne sent him to evangelize the Saxons.  He preached to them for two years but, in 782, the Saxons under Widukind, rebelled against Charlemagne and Willehad was forced to flee to Frisia.  He took the opportunity to travel to Rome where he reported to Pope Adrian I on his work.
Upon his return from Rome, Willehad retired for a time to the monastery of Echternach, in present day Luxembourg.  He spent two years there reassembling his missionary team.
After Charlemagne's conquest of the Saxons, Willehad preached in the region about the lower Elbe and the lower Weser. In 787 Willehad was consecrated bishop, and that part of Saxony and Friesland about the mouth of the Weser assigned him for his diocese. He chose as his see the city of Bremen, which is mentioned for the first time in documents of 782, and built there a cathedral. Praised for its beauty by Anschar, it was dedicated in 789.Lins, Joseph. "Bremen." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 19 May 2013

Árnafjørður is a town of the municipality of Klaksvík, on the island of Borðoy, in the Faroe Islands. 
Árnafjørður is located at the bottom of a deep inlet, named (H)Árnfjarðarvík, "corner fjord's bay", on the east side of Borðoy. In 1875, an abandoned Norwegian vessel loaded with large amounts of timber drifted ashore at Árnafjørður. The timber was sold at an auction and, because of the sudden surplus, the price for timber decreased significantly. Timber has always been expensive in the Faroes as, other than driftwood, it usually has to be imported.

The Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (HB&WRJR&DCo.) was opened on 20 July 1885. It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885.
The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an eight-mile branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway).
Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway. Following incorporation into the LNER, duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function – notably Cannon Street station and the Springhead Locomotive Works.
Closure of the greater part of the main line itself came during the time of British Railways. As of 2011 the elevated line in Hull with some of the extensions and alterations added by the NER and LNER are still in use and referred to as the Hull Docks Branch and has the Engineers' Line Reference of HJS.[tpl]#tag:ref|HJS "Hessle Road Junction to Saltend"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/ELRs/ELRh.shtm| title = Engineer's Line References (ELRs) : Codes beginning H| work=www.railwaycodes.org.uk/ELRs/ELRh.shtm|first=Phil |last=Deaves|at= HJS|accessdate=15 April 2014[/tpl]|group="note"[/tpl]

Auto comes from the Greek reflexive pronoun while genocide comes from Greek genos meaning "race, tribe" and the Latin word -cidere meaning "kill".
The term was coined in the latter half of the 1970s to describe the actions of the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, to distinguish such acts from the genocide of groups considered "other" by a government, such as the killing of Jews and people of Slavic origin by Nazi Germany.Bjornson, Karin.

Cayo Luis Peña, formerly South West KeyMap of 1898 is a small, uninhabited island off the west coast of Culebra, an island municipality of Puerto Rico. The island is a nature reserve which forms part of the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge. Visitors are allowed on the island for nature walks, snorkeling, and swimming; however, visitors are not allowed to stay on the island overnight. The island is only accessible via private water taxis.  This limited access results in relatively few visitors and the island and surrounding reefs are able to stay more pristine as a result.  The small number of visitors also makes the island more private for those willing to make the journey.  Luis Peña Beach is located on the north side of the island. The island is named after its second owner.

The Collegium Trilingue, often also called Collegium trium linguarum, or, after its creator Collegium Buslidianum (French:  Collège des Trois Langues, Dutch: Dry Tonghen), was founded in 1517 under the patronage of the humanist, Jeroen Van Busleyden (in Latin Hieronymus Buslidius).
The College, in fact inspired by Erasmus who was a friend of Busleyden, was inaugurated in September 1518.
It was not formally part of the University of Leuven, but had been founded by a group of humanists who wanted to spread humanism and the revival of the classics (specifically the literae humaniores), which were not popular at the time at the medieval University of Leuven. They promoted the teaching of the three ancient languages: Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
Leon E. Halkin writes that "Erasmus does not teach himself, but he recruits the best teachers of Latin, Greek and Hebrew".Léon E. Halkin, Érasme parmi nous, Paris, Fayard, 1987, pp. 174-175.
Under this model, King Francis I of France founded the Royal College in 1530 (now Collège de France). He sought to attract Erasmus who declined the offer.

SS ''Deutschland Sometimes called Deutschland IV'' to distinguish from others of the name was a 21,046 gross registered ton (GRT) German HAPAG ocean liner which was sunk in a British air attack in 1945, with great loss of life.
One of a group of four ships that included the SS Albert Ballin, SS Hamburg, and SS New York, the Deutschland was launched on 28 April 1923. She began her maiden voyage on 27 March 1924, to Southampton and then on to New York City. The ship had tremendous problems with vibration, becoming known as the "Cocktail Shaker"; she was re-engined in 1929, with service speed reduced to 19 knots.
In 1940, she became an accommodation ship for the German navy at Gotenhafen. In 1945, on seven Baltic voyages, she carried 70,000 soldiers and refugees from the German eastern territories to the west.

Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in October 1992.  Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin' in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience.[tpl]cite web|title=Virtua Racing – Arcade (1992)|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100412225953/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html|work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=19 January 2014|year=14 March 2001[/tpl]
The original arcade game has three levels, designated into difficulties. Beginner is "Big Forest", intermediate is "Bay Bridge" and expert is "Acropolis". Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in "Big Forest", or the "Bay Bridge" itself, or the tight hairpin of "Acropolis".
VR introduced the "V.R. View System" by allowing the player to choose one of four views to play the game. This feature was then used in most other Sega arcade racing games (and is mentioned as a feature in the attract mode of games such as Daytona USA). It was later ported to home consoles, starting with the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.

[[Duplicate bridge]]
CATEGORIES: Contract bridge

Duplicate bridge is the most widely used variation of contract bridge in club and tournament play. It is called duplicate because the same bridge deal (i.e. the specific arrangement of the 52 cards into the four hands) is played at each table and scoring is based on relative performance. In this way, every hand, whether strong or weak, is played in competition with others playing the identical cards, and the element of skill is heightened while that of chance is reduced. Duplicate bridge stands in contrast to rubber bridge where each hand is freshly dealt and where scores may be more affected by chance in the short run.
Bridge boards, simple four-way card holders, are used to enable each player's hand to be passed intact to the next table that must play the deal, and final scores are calculated by comparing each pair's result with others who played the same hand. Bidding boxes are often used to facilitate the mechanics of bidding, prevent inadvertent passing of information, and minimize the noise level.  Screens are used in higher levels of competition and were introduced to reduce the chance of passing unauthorised information to one's partner.
In duplicate bridge, a player normally plays with the same partner throughout an event. The two are known as a "pair". There are two exceptions: in team events with up to six members swapping partners for portions of the event, and in individual tournaments, in which players change partners for each round.

[[International Suppliers Network]]

CATEGORIES: Credit rating agencies

The International Suppliers Network is a system which logs and tracks vendors. Major companies such as General Motors often use the ISN to establish the "trustworthy" status of a new vendor. The ISN also allows companies to import a validated version of a vendors details directly into their own procurement system.
Companies which have an ISN Profile automatically are issued with an ISN Rating, which is a rating of a company's stability and ability to manage its business. This made the ISN profile a good International identifier. General ratings range from -10 to 10, with a default value of 1. This is based on a number of key criteria, such as financial stability, and trading history performance.
The ISN is regulated by the International Charter organization.

Debuting in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the character was initially intended to be a surprise as an apparent monster who unexpectedly proves to be a great hero. As such, Bill becomes the first being outside of the Marvel Universe's Norse pantheon to be deemed worthy enough to wield Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. After an initial rivalry for possession of the weapon, the alien warrior was granted a war hammer of his own, called Stormbreaker, and the two reconciled as staunch allies.
Beta Ray Bill has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated television series, video games, and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards. He was voiced by Paul Dobson in the animated DVD film Planet Hulk.

MV ''Joyita'' was a merchant vessel from which 25 passengers and crew mysteriously disappeared in the South Pacific in 1955. It was found adrift in the South Pacific without its crew on board. The ship was in very poor condition, including corroded pipes and a radio which, while functional, only had a range of about 2 miles due to faulty wiring. Despite this, the extreme buoyancy of the ship made sinking nearly impossible. Investigators were puzzled as to why the crew did not remain on board and wait for help.

Sophia Theresa "Sophie" Pemberton (13 February 1869 - 31 October 1959) was a Canadian painter. Despite the social limitations placed on female artists at the time, she made a noteworthy contribution to Canadian art and was the first woman to win the Prix Julian, in 1899.
Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Sophie, as she was known throughout her life,[tpl]citation |last= Tuele |first= Nicholas Craig |title=Sophia Theresa Pemberton: Her Life and Art |url= https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/21949 |year=1980 |publisher = The University of British Columbia [/tpl]  was the daughter of Teresa Jane Grautoff and Joseph Despard Pemberton (1821–1893). A successful executive with the Hudson's Bay Company and the first Surveyor-General of Vancouver Island, her father could afford to send her to live and study in Paris at the Académie Julian.[tpl]citation |last= Francis (ed) |first= Daniel |editor=Francis, Daniel |title=Encyclopedia of British Columbia |url= http://www.knowbc.com/ |origyear=1999 |year=2000 |publisher = Harbour Publishing |isbn = 1-55017-200-X |page= 537[/tpl] 
Pemberton painted at a time when her chosen media had been the exclusive domain of men and her European influences can be seen in her work. The painter of both portraits and landscapes, Pemberton was the first artist from the province of British Columbia to receive international acclaim when her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, including her award-winning 1897 work seen here, entitled Little Boy Blue.
In 1905, she married Canon Arthur Beanlands, an Anglican priest, a widower. He died in 1917 and in 1920 she married Horace Deane-Drummond, who was older than her and indeed had children almost her age.
Beyond her work on canvas, Pemberton taught painting to local female artists. In 1909 she did the artistic decoration for the non-denominational Pemberton Memorial Chapel gifted by her family to Victoria's Royal Jubilee Hospital.
She was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.[tpl]cite web|title=Members since 1880|url=http://rca-arc.ca/who-we-are/members/members-since-1880/|publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]

Geographical coordinates for the tower are [tpl]coord|45|23|00|N|93|42|31|W|[/tpl].
The tower was completed in 1997 and is property of Paxson Minneapolis (now a division of ION Media Networks, the owner of the ION Television network).  KXLI was the call sign of channel 41 when the tower was built.  It surpassed the height of the KMSP Tower, completed in 1971.
The tallest non-guyed structures in the state are the IDS Tower (792 ft/241.4 m or 910 ft/277.3 m with rooftop antennas) and the Capella Tower (776 ft/236.5 m) in Minneapolis.

It is the only state theatre to have its own troupe of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. The theatre is part of the Palais-Royal complex and located at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.
The theatre has also been known as the Théâtre de la République and La maison de Molière (English: House of Molière). It inherited the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before “La maison de Molière” was rechristened the “Comédie-Française,” and the company continued to be known popularly by the former name even after the official change of name.[tpl]Cite Americana|wstitle=Comédie Française[/tpl]

[[Silabenzene]]
CATEGORIES: Silicon heterocycles

A silabenzene is a heteroaromatic compound containing one or more silicon atoms instead of carbon atoms in benzene. A single substitution gives silabenzene proper; additional substitutions give a disilabenzene (3 theoretical isomers), trisilabenzene (3 isomers), etc.
Silabenzenes have been the targets of many theoretical and synthetic studies by organic chemists interested in the question of whether analogs of benzene with Group IV elements heavier than carbon, e.g., silabenzene, stannabenzene and germabenzene -- so-called "heavy benzenes" -- exhibit aromaticity.
Although several heteroaromatic compounds bearing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms have been known since the early stages of organic chemistry, silabenzene had been considered to be a transient, un-isolable compound and was detected only in low-temperature matrices or as its Diels-Alder adduct for a long time. In recent years, however, a kinetically stabilized silabenzene and other heavy aromatic compounds with silicon or germanium atoms have been reported.

Climbing Mount Improbable is a 1996 popular science book by Richard Dawkins. The book is about probability and how it applies to the theory of evolution, and is designed to debunk claims by creationists about the probability of naturalistic mechanisms like natural selection.
The main metaphorical treatment is of a geographical landscape, upon which evolution can only ascend in a gradual way, not being able to climb cliffs (this is known as an adaptive landscape). In the book Dawkins gives ideas about a seemingly complex mechanism coming about from many gradual steps that were previously unseen.
The book grew out of the annual Royal Institution Christmas Lectures which Dawkins delivered in 1991 (see Growing Up in the Universe). It is illustrated by Dawkins' wife Lalla Ward; and is dedicated to Robert Winston, "a good doctor and a good man".
The book is divided into ten chapters as follows:

The club was founded in 1919 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the top division of French football. Saint-Étienne plays its home matches at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard located within the city. The team is managed by Christophe Galtier and captained by Loïc Perrin, who started his career at the club in 1996.[tpl]cite news |title=Biographie: Loïc Perrin |url=http://www.loicperrin.fr/biographie.html |publisher=Loïc Perrin |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011 [/tpl]
Saint-Étienne is, arguably, the most successful club in French football history having won ten Ligue 1 titles, six Coupe de France titles, a Coupe de la Ligue title and five Trophée des champions. The club's ten league titles is the most professional league titles won by a French club, while the six cup victories places the club third among most Coupe de France titles. Saint-Étienne has also won the second division on three occasions. The club achieved most of its honours in the 1960s and 70s when the club was led by managers Jean Snella, Albert Batteux, and Robert Herbin. Saint-Étienne's primary rivals are Olympique Lyonnais, who are based in nearby Lyon. The two teams annually contest the Derby du Rhône. In 2009, the club added a female section to the football club.
Saint-Étienne have produced several notable players, mostly during its dynastic run in the 1960s and 70s, who have gone on to have coaching careers domestically and internationally. The club unearthed players and managers such as Aimé Jacquet, Jacques Santini, Laurent Blanc and Michel Platini. Each player went on to have a managerial stint with the France national team. Jacquet coached the team to victory at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, while Santini won the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. Blanc was the manager of the national team for two years between 2010 and 2012.

By 1867 it owned [tpl]fract|226|1|4[/tpl] route miles ([tpl]convert|226+1/4|mi|km|disp=output only[/tpl]) of line and operated over a further [tpl]convert|61|mi[/tpl].
The early expansion was followed by a period of forced economy, but in the 1880s the railway was refurbished, express services began to run and by the end of that decade there was a suburban service in Aberdeen. The railway operated its main line between Aberdeen and [tpl]rws|Keith[/tpl] and two routes west to [tpl]rws|Elgin[/tpl], connections could be made at both Keith and Elgin for Highland Railway services to Inverness. There were other junctions with the Highland Railway at [tpl]rws|Boat of Garten[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Portessie[/tpl], and at Aberdeen connections for journeys south over the Caledonian and North British Railways. Its eventual area encompassed the three Scottish counties of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Moray, with short lengths of line in Inverness-shire and Kincardineshire.[tpl]cite book|last=Conolly|first=W. Philip|title=British Railways Pre-Grouping Atlas and Gazetteer|year=2004|publisher=Ian Allan|isbn=978-0-7110-0320-0|edition=Fifth[/tpl]
Fish from the North Sea ports and whisky from the distilleries of Speyside became important goods traffic. The Royal Family used the Deeside Line for travel to and from Balmoral Castle and when they were residence a daily special 'Messenger Train' ran from Aberdeen; for most of the railway's life this was its only Sunday service. The company ran three hotels, and a network of feeder bus services was developed in the early 20th century. In 1923, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway as its Northern Scottish area, passing on [tpl]convert|333+1/2|mi[/tpl] of line and 122 steam locomotives, most of them 4-4-0 tender locomotives. Although the railway had several branches, its remoteness has resulted in only its main line remaining today as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line.

The McDonnell Douglas MD-12 was an aircraft design study undertaken by the McDonnell Douglas company in the 1990s for a "superjumbo" aircraft, first conceived as a larger trijet, then stretched to a 4-engine airliner.  It was to be similar in size to the Boeing 747, but with more passenger capacity.  However, the MD-12 received no orders and was canceled.  McDonnell Douglas then studied larger MD-11 derivatives named MD-XX without proceeding.

CATEGORIES: Loricariidae, Fish common names

Hypostomus plecostomus (known colloquially as a sucker fish) is the scientific name for a type of freshwater tropical Central and South American fish belonging to the family Loricariidae. They are large algae eaters, and to differentiate them from small algae eaters, they are often referred to using the common names plecostomus, often abbreviated as plecos or plecs. Plecostomus is also a synonym of the genus Hypostomus and the genus Loricariichthys. They are extremely popular in aquariums for their ability to clean tanks by eating algae growth and dead fish. These friendly-natured fish can typically be purchased when about [tpl]convert|8|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] and often grow up to [tpl]convert|60|cm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Such larger specimens are impractical for any but the largest aquariums.
Plecos are omnivorous, but in the wild feed nocturnally mostly on plant material. During the day, their unusual omega irises block a lot of light out of their eyes, but they are usually open at night. They can roll their eyes within their sockets, giving the appearance of winking. Plecos are usually skittish and quickly hide whenever they sense danger.

[tpl]Nihongo|Gaara|我愛羅[/tpl] is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Kishimoto designed Gaara as a foil to the series' titular character, Naruto Uzumaki, as the two were born through similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities as they deal with their troubled upbringing. Initially introduced as an antagonist, Gaara is a ninja affiliated with Sunagakure, and is the son of Sunagakure's leader, the Fourth Kazekage. He was born a demon's host as part of his father's intention to have a weapon to restore their village. However, a combination of being ostracized by the Sunagakure villagers, his early inability to control the Tailed Beast, and the notion that his deceased mother called him her curse on the village caused Gaara to become a ruthless killer who believes his own purpose is to kill his enemies. It is only after meeting Naruto Uzumaki that Gaara gains a change of perspective as he eventually becomes Sunagakure's Fifth Kazekage and gains acceptance by his people.
Gaara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including two of the featured films in the series, the third original video animation, and several video games. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Gaara's character. IGN labeled the disparity between Naruto and Gaara as "emotional" and "a tad creepy". Anime News Network called Naruto's fight against Gaara the high point of the entire series. Among the Naruto reader base, Gaara has been popular, placing high in several popularity polls, and always making it to the top ten characters. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released in Gaara's likeness, including plush dolls, key chains and action figures.

[[Cardiff Railway]]
CATEGORIES: Railway companies established in 1897, Railway lines opened in 1897, Railway companies disestablished in 1922, Pre-grouping British railway companies, Great Western Railway constituents, Standard gauge railways in Wales

The Cardiff Railway came into being from the need to service Bute Docks, so as to provide facilities for the traffic to and from the Docks. The railway was only 11 miles in length, a fact which belied its importance, since it provided both the Taff Vale Railway and the Rhymney Railway, inter alia, with access.
On 6 August 1897 the Bute Docks Company became the Cardiff Railway Company, and the line between Heath Junction and Treforest was opened. This opening was filled with difficulties, because Treforest Junction was on the Taff Vale Railway, at the same point as the TVR's junction with the Barry Railway. Here the Barry syphoned off large amounts of coal traffic for transport to Barry Docks. The TVR had no intention of allowing more to be syphoned off by another company, and so it defied the Act of Parliament which had authorised the junction and appealed against its opening on the grounds that it was unsafe.
A delay of some years was followed by an agreement over the design of the junction and the successful running of a ceremonial opening train, which was promptly followed by the TVR, with the support of the Barry, removing the junction; again on the grounds that it was unsafe. It was obvious to all concerned that the TVR was deliberately attempting to crush this rival before it became too big, but little could be done about their petty objections - particularly as the junction was on their railway. Regular coal trains never used the junction, as the Cardiff Railway gave up the battle at this point and suggested a merger between it, the TVR, and the Rhymney Railway. Although both companies involved agreed with this, the Barry and Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway objected on the grounds of unfair competition, particularly as the TVR was one of the world's most profitable railways (although the Barry was a close second).
Ultimately the Cardiff was forced to acknowledge that it would never be a successful company in its own right, but remained independent until the Railways Act 1921, when it became a constituent part of the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922.

The Missouri Pacific Railroad [tpl]reporting mark|MP[/tpl], also known as the MoPac, was one of the first railroads in the United States west of the Mississippi River. MoPac was a Class I railroad growing from dozens of predecessors and mergers, including the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (SLIMS), Texas and Pacific Railway (TP), Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (C&EI), St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway (SLBM), Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway (KO&G), Midland Valley Railroad (MV), San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad (SAU&G), Gulf Coast Lines (GC), International-Great Northern Railroad (IGN), New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railway (NOTM), Missouri-Illinois Railroad (MI), as well as the small Central Branch Railway (an early predecessor of MP in Kansas and south central Nebraska), and joint ventures such as the Alton and Southern Railroad (AS).
At year-end 1967 operated mileage was 9041 miles of road and 13318 miles of track, not including DK&S, NO&LC, T&P and its subsidiaries, C&EI or Missouri-Illinois.
On January 8, 1980, the Missouri Pacific Railroad was purchased by the Union Pacific Railroad. Because of lawsuits filed by various competing railroads, the merger was not approved until September 13, 1982. After the Supreme Court denied a trial from the Southern Pacific, the merger took effect on December 22, 1982, at 2:55 p.m. However, due to outstanding bonds of the Missouri Pacific, the merger with Union Pacific did not become official until January 1, 1997.

[[Japanese loanwords in Hawaii]]

CATEGORIES: Hawaiian language, English-based pidgins and creoles, Japanese-American culture in Hawaii, Lists of loanwords

Many loanwords in Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaiian Creole English) derive from the Japanese language. The linguistic influences of the Japanese in Hawaii began with the first immigrants from Japan in 1868 and continues with the large Japanese American population in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i today.
The following lists three categories of Japanese loanwords in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i: Food, Objects, and Miscellaneous.
There are other Japanese words common among the Japanese American population (such as "okazu" and "obaachan"), but not as well-known among Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's general population. Such words have not been included here, nor have Japanese words which have entered the English language on a national level, such as "anime," (:ja:アニメ) "karaoke," (:ja:カラオケ) "samurai," (侍) and "sushi" (:ja:寿司). Hawaiʻi is also unique in the United States in that Japanese loanwords often retain Japanese pronunciation, as in the rolled "r" sound in words like "karaoke," "furikake," and "karate." 
Some words are not from the standard Japanese language. They instead originated from Japan's regional dialects. For example, the word "bobora" is said to be spoken only in certain prefectures, especially in western Japan where many of the Japanese immigrants came from. It originates from the Portuguese word abóbora meaning Japanese pumpkin.

The 2006 Canadian federal election (more formally, the 39th General Election) was held on January 23, 2006, to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 39th Parliament of Canada. The Conservative Party of Canada won the greatest number of seats: 40.3% of seats, or 124 out of 308, up from 99 seats in 2004, and 36.3% of votes: up from 29.6% in the 2004 election. The election resulted in a minority government led by the Conservative Party with Stephen Harper becoming the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada.  By proportion of seats, this was Canada's smallest minority government since Confederation.  An investigation by Elections Canada into improper election spending by the Conservative Party became widely known as the In and Out scandal. Despite this it was the longest serving minority government overall.

Forssell began his professional career in 1997 for HJK, having progressed through the team's youth teams, but he only remained at the club for a single season, making 17 league appearances, before he moved to England to join Chelsea in 1998. He never broke into the Chelsea team (making 33 league appearances in seven years), and spent two loan spells at Crystal Palace, one at Borussia Mönchengladbach, and two at Birmingham City. He switched permanently to the latter club in 2005, but injury problems restricted him to 65 league appearances in three seasons. He joined German side Hannover 96 in July 2008 on a free transfer, but once again struggled with form and injury problems, and he left the club in 2011, having made 44 league appearances. 
This was followed by an unsuccessful season back in England, this time with Leeds United; 15 league games failed to yield a single goal. Forssell returned to current club HJK in October 2012.
Forssell made his full international debut for Finland in 1999, and has been a regular player for his country in almost every year since; the one exception being 2012, where he didn't make a single appearance. He has 86 caps for his country, and has scored 29 goals; making him the sixth most capped Finnish player, and his country's second highest goalscorer.

[[Rolls-Royce Meteor]]

CATEGORIES: Aero-derivative engines, Marine engines, Rolls-Royce piston engines, Rover engines, Gasoline engines by model, Tank engines

The Rolls-Royce Meteor (also sometimes known as the Rover Meteor) was a British tank engine of the Second World War.
It was developed from the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero-engine by W. A. Robotham and his chassis design and development division at Belper, as they were not involved in aero-engine work. With the aid of engineers from Leyland, who were engaged in tank work, he considered RR's two V12s. The Kestrel, while having more power than the existing "Liberty" or Meadows engines, did not provide the desirable 20 bhp per ton required, so the Merlin III was used.
Despite his lack of experience in tank design or warfare, Robotham was made Chief Engineer of Tank Design and joined the Tank Board. He was involved in the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank. The Tank Division at Belper was involved with the overall design of four versions of the Cromwell tank, using a standard set of components.

[[Dominion Theology]]

CATEGORIES: Christian eschatology, Christian terms, Christian fundamentalism, Christian law, Dominionism, Religious nationalism, Conspiracy theories in the United States

Dominion Theology or Dominionism is the idea that Christians should work toward either a nation governed by Christians or one governed by a conservative Christian understanding of biblical law.  At least under this name, it exists primarily among Protestants in the United States.  It is a form of theocracy and is related to theonomy, though it does not necessarily advocate Mosaic law as the basis of government.  Prominent adherents of Dominion Theology are otherwise theologically diverse, including the Calvinist Christian Reconstructionism and the charismatic/Pentecostal Kingdom Now theology and New Apostolic Reformation.
Some elements within the mainstream Christian right have been influenced by Dominion Theology authors.  Indeed, some writers have applied the term "Dominionism" more broadly to the mainstream Christian right, implicitly arguing that that movement is founded upon a theology that requires Christians to govern over non-Christians.  Mainstream conservatives do not call themselves "Dominionists," and the usage has sparked considerable controversy.

Sun-Maid Growers of California is a privately owned American cooperative of raisin growers headquartered in Kingsburg, California. Sun-Maid is the largest raisin and dried fruit processor in the world.  As a cooperative, Sun-Maid is made up of approximately 850 family farmers who grow raisin grapes within [tpl]convert|100|mi|km|-2[/tpl] radius of the processing plant. Sun-Maid also sources dried fruit beyond this geographical area. In 2012, Sun-Maid celebrated its 100th Anniversary as a grower cooperative.
Sun-Maid raisins are packaged in a red box featuring the iconic “Sun-Maid Girl” wearing a red sunbonnet and holding a tray of fresh grapes. Sun-Maid raisins are grown in the Central Valley of California, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, a region known for its unique Mediterranean climate perfect for growing grapes and drying them to make raisins. The grapes are picked at harvest time, usually late August to early September, and dried naturally in the sun, either by hand-picking them and laying them on paper trays or allowing them to dry-on-the-vine (DOV) for mechanical harvesting. After about 14 days, they are placed in bins and delivered to the Sun-Maid plant for processing, packaging and shipping to customers throughout the United States and in more than 60 countries around the world.
Sun-Maid produces more than 200 million pounds of natural raisins annually. Nearly half of all Sun-Maid raisins are packed for consumer sales, whether in a box, a bag or a canister in varying sizes. The other half are sold as an ingredient to bakeries, cereal companies, as raisin paste and raisin concentrate. The Thompson Seedless grape is the most popular variety used to make raisins, although other grapes, such as Fiesta, Flame and Zante currants are also used.
In addition to raisins, Sun-Maid packs a full line of dried fruit, such as figs, dates, cranberries, apples, prunes, apricots and tropical fruits. Sun-Maid also packs yogurt-covered raisins, such as those dipped in dark chocolate, vanilla, orange cream, strawberry-Greek and cherry-chocolate flavored yogurt.
The company maintains extensive brand licensing and food service operations.The Promotion in Motion Companies, Inc., under license from Sun-Maid, produces a Sun-Maid Milk Chocolate Covered Raisin.

[tpl]About|the novel|other uses|Black House (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Black House[/tpl]

Black House is a Stoker Award winning novel by horror writers Stephen King and Peter Straub. Published in 2001, this is the sequel to The Talisman.
This is one of King's numerous novels, which also include Hearts in Atlantis and Insomnia, that tie in with the Dark Tower series.
Straub is from Wisconsin, which may be why the story is set there rather than King's frequently used backdrop of Maine.  The town of "French Landing" is a fictionalized version of the town of Trempealeau, Wisconsin.  There you will find "Chase Street", "Sumner Street", King Street (instead of "Queen Street"), and the famous "Sand Bar." Also, "Centralia" is named after the nearby small town of Centerville, Wisconsin, located at the intersection of Hwy 93 and Hwy 35. 
A chapter of the book is written around Edgar Allan Poe's poem "The Raven."

[[Symphonic metal]]

CATEGORIES: Fusion music genres, Heavy metal subgenres, Symphonic metal

Symphonic metal is metal music that has symphonic elements; that is, elements that are borrowed from other music genres (i.e., classical music, progressive rock) but usually with more keyboards or acoustic guitars and typically an operatic female lead vocalist.
When referring to bands from other genres, it refers to bands who use minor classical and operatic themes in their music similar to that found in the symphonic metal genre, to show they are more "symphonic" than other bands within their genre. 
Although many symphonic metal bands base their style solidly on classical music, a few follow a theatrical, more epic approach to this genre by including or basing their style in film music or movie soundtracks. A popular example of this type of approach would be the works of Nightwish and Epica.

[[Electric double-layer capacitor]]

CATEGORIES: Capacitors, Emerging technologies, Energy conversion

Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) are, together with pseudocapacitors, part of a new type of electrochemical capacitors[tpl]Literatur|Autor=B. E. Conway|Titel=Electrochemical Supercapacitors: Scientific Fundamentals and Technological Applications|Verlag=Springer|Ort=Berlin|ISBN=0306457369|Jahr=1999|Seiten=1–8|Online=[tpl]Google Buch|BuchID=8yvzlr9TqI0C|Seite=1[/tpl][/tpl] See also Brian E. Conway in Electrochemistry Encyclopedia: Electrochemical Capacitors — Their Nature, Function and Applications called supercapacitors, also known as ultracapacitors. Supercapacitors do not have a conventional solid dielectric. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage principles:
Double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance both contribute to the total capacitance value of a supercapacitor.Elzbieta Frackowiak, Francois Beguin, PERGAMON, Carbon 39 (2001) 937–950, Carbon materials for the electrochemical storage of energy in Capacitors PDF  However, the ratio of the two can vary greatly, depending on the design of the electrodes and the composition of the electrolyte. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.
Supercapacitors are divided into three families, based on the design of the electrodes:
Supercapacitors have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest energy density of all capacitors. They can have capacitance values of [tpl]val|fmt=commas|10000[/tpl] times that of electrolytic capacitors; up to [tpl]val|fmt=commas|12000[/tpl] F at working voltages of [tpl]val|1.2[/tpl] V.  Supercapacitors bridge the gap between capacitors and rechargeable batteries. In terms of specific energy, as well as in terms of specific power, this gap covers several orders of magnitude. However, batteries still have about ten times the capacity of supercapacitors.[tpl]cite journal |first=R. |last=Kötz |first2=M. |last2=Carlen|journal=Electrochimica Acta |volume=45 |year=2000 |pages=2483–2498 |title=Principles and applications of electrochemical capacitors |url=http://144.206.159.178/ft/308/18782/332034.pdf[/tpl] While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their power density is generally 10 to 100 times as great. This makes charge and discharge cycles of supercapacitors much faster than batteries. Additionally, they will tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than batteries.
In these electrochemical capacitors, the electrolyte is the conductive connection between the two active electrodes. This distinguishes them from electrolytic capacitors, in which the electrolyte is the cathode and thus forms the second electrode.
Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with the correct polarity. Polarity is controlled by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied during manufacture.
Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications for power and energy requirements, including:

Unode is a short form of underground node. A script or program that combines other programs for creating a decentralized anonymous encrypted communication network. Other programs include: Entropy, Mixmaster, GPG, NEWSPOST, plus Plugins for more.
Unode is a project to create a set of bash scripts to help Activists communicate without revealing their IP, or other personal data.
Some of these scripts are used to forward email lists to the newsgroup alt.activism.underground. By doing this, activists can read important action alerts and other information without being included on the servers email lists that run the lists. Email headers are removed from these posts, as well as email addresses themselves are altered to help avoid spam.
Unix bash scripts are used because it is easy for other to alter or correct errors in the scripts, and because it is an easy way to try out new ideas. It is used as a rough draft, before the eventual move to stable binary programs.

CATEGORIES: 1886 births, 1946 deaths, American dramatists and playwrights, Writers from Chicago, Illinois

Edward Brewster Sheldon (Chicago, Illinois, February 4, 1886 – April 1, 1946, New York City) was an American dramatist. His plays include Salvation Nell (1908) and Romance (1913), which was made into a motion picture with Greta Garbo.
After becoming ill at age 29 with crippling rheumatoid arthritis, which eventually claimed his sight (around 1930), Sheldon became a source of emotional and creative support for his many friends, including such luminaries of the literary and theatrical world as Minnie Maddern Fiske (he wrote Salvation Nell for her), Julia Marlowe, John Barrymore, Thornton Wilder, Alexander Woollcott, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Ruth Gordon, Helen Hayes and many others.
In May 1915 Sheldon narrowly missed sailing on the Lusitania's infamous last voyage. He had been asked by theater impresario Charles Frohman to accompany him to England. A Harvard classmate of Sheldon's was getting married on May 11 and asked Sheldon to be best man. Sheldon then declined Frohman's offer.
A 1936 lawsuit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for copyright infringement claimed that the script MGM used for the 1932 motion picture Letty Lynton plagiarized material from the play Dishonored Lady by Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes. The film is still unavailable today because of this lawsuit.
His life is detailed in The Man Who Lived Twice by Eric Wollencott Barnes. In this biography Barnes states that Sheldon was in love all his adult life with Doris Keane, the actress who starred in Romance in 1913.

Chem. Educ. | year=2005 | volume=82 | issue=2 | pages=325-333 | doi=10.1021/ed082p325[/tpl]  The bond triangle shows that ionic, metallic and covalent bonds are not just particular bonds of a specific type.  Rather, bond types are interconnected and different compounds have varying degrees of different bonding character (for example, covalent bonds with significant ionic character are called polar covalent bonds).
Different compounds can be placed around the triangle. On the right side (from ionic to covalent) should be compounds with varying difference in electronegativity, in the covalent corner compounds with equal electronegativity such as Cl2 (chlorine), in the ionic corner compounds with large electronegativity difference such as NaCl (table salt). The bottom side (from metallic to covalent) is for compounds with varying degree of directionality in the bond. At one extreme is metallic bonds with delocalized bonding and the other are covalent bonds in which the orbitals overlap in a particular direction. The left side (from ionic to metallic) is for delocalized bonds with varying electronegativity difference.
Three species at the vertices of the triangle are: caesium (metallic), fluorine (covalent) and caesium fluoride (ionic).

Joseph Havelock Wilson (16 August 1859 – 16 April 1929) was a trade union leader, Liberal Party politician, and campaigner for the rights of merchant seamen.
He was born in Sunderland and went to sea as a boy, serving somewhere between 10 and 14 years at sea. In 1879 whilst still a seaman he married Jane Ann Watham at Sunderland. In 1882 he opened a "Temperance Hotel" in Sunderland settling down to life ashore at the age of 24. He became involved in a local seamen's union established in Sunderland in 1879 & had become its president by 1885. Wilson pursued a policy of attempting to build branches in nearby ports, which met with some success but led to disagreements within the leadership. In 1887, Wilson broke with the Sunderland union to establish his own National Sailors' & Firemen's Union, which was committed to a policy of expansion. Wilson remained president of the union until his death.

Central Reorganization Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), a communist group in India 1979-1991. The Secretary of the All-India Leading Committee of the CRC, CPI(ML) was K. Venu. The main organ of CRC, CPI(ML) was called Mass Line. CRC, CPI(ML) also published Liberation and Comrade.
CRC, CPI(ML) emerged from the pro-Charu Majumdar tendency of the Naxalite movement. It had its main roots in the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)). But the KSC differed from the original CPI(ML) by advocating a mass line.
In 1982 the First All India Conference of CRC, CPI(ML) was held. The second conference was held in 1987.
In 1984 CRC, CPI(ML) was one of the three founders of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (the others being Revolutionary Communist Party (USA) and Partido Comunista Revolucionario (Chile)).

[[But Seriously, Folks...]]

"But Seriously, Folks..." is the fourth studio album by Joe Walsh, released in 1978 (see 1978 in music). It included the satirical song "Life's Been Good". The original eight-minute album version of this track was edited down to 4½ minutes for single release and this became Walsh's biggest solo hit, peaking at #12 on the Billboard chart.
The album also features the other four members of the Eagles—which Walsh had joined two years earlier—as well as singer-keyboardist Jay Ferguson, a former member of the groups Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne (who co-wrote one track on the album), drummer Joe Vitale from Walsh's former band Barnstorm, and bassist Willie Weeks.
Original pressings of this record had text engraved on the carry-out grooves:
The leadout track after "Life's Been Good" has a recording of "A flock of wah-wahs" which is a minute of gibberish wah-wahs.
Walsh ran a mock campaign for President in 1980; one of the planks of his platform was to make "Life's Been Good" the new national anthem.

In Islam, the Isha' daily prayer has four required (Fard) rak'ah. However, in Sunni Islam, the two Sunnah rak'ah following the Isha' are highly recommended and  so is the 3 rakat Wajib Witr. There are a few optional prayers that can be recited after the Isha' prayer, including the Nafilat ul-Layl prayers (together termed tahajjud), as well as the tarawih in Ramadan.

Mariana Pineda is a play by the Spanish playwright and poet Federico García Lorca. It is based on the life of Mariana de Pineda Muñoz, whose republican opposition to Ferdinand VII had become part of the folklore of Granada. The play was written between 1923 and 1925 and was first performed in June 1927 at the Teatre Goya in Barcelona. That production was directed by García Lorca, with scenic design and costumes by Salvador Dalí, and was performed by the company of Margarida Xirgu. The play received its Madrid première that October, at the Teatro Fontalba.Edwards (1980, 31).
In contrast to García Lorca's first play, The Butterfly's Evil Spell, which was first performed in 1920 but which closed after only four performances, Mariana Pineda was a success. Consequently, García Lorca often claimed that Mariana Pineda was his first play.
The play figures prominently in the opera Ainadamar (2003) by Osvaldo Golijov.

[[Peter Wilson Coldham]]

CATEGORIES: English genealogists, 1926 births, Living people

Peter Wilson Coldham (1926 - 2012, London), was a British genealogist.
Coldham was awarded the Bickersteth Medal in 1991, was a Fellow of the American Society of Genealogists (FASG) and Fellow of the Society of Genealogists (FSG).
He wrote over 26 books and multiple monographs and magazine articles, including many standard works on Anglo-American genealogy.
The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775
Between 1614 and 1775 more than 50,000 English men, women, and children were sentenced to be deported to the American colonies for crimes ranging from the theft of a handkerchief to bigamy or highway robbery and sold as indentured servants from 7 to 14 years depending upon the crime against the crown. After years of painstaking research, the names of nearly all those transported were extracted from official court records by Peter Coldham and published in the landmark work The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage in 1988 and its Supplement in 1992, forming the largest and most complete passenger list of its kind ever published. From this unexpected source the researcher at last had the means of learning the names of the persons transported to the colonies, the charges against them, the dates and places of sentencing, the ship names, and the places of arrival in the colonies.http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=49263
Supplement to The Complete Book of Emigrants in Bondage, 1614-1775
The original volume of Emigrants in Bondage published in 1988 acknowledged that there were some notable omissions from the list of transported felons then printed, which remained to be researched and remedied. The Supplement of 1992 began to supply the omissions, but now with the publication of More Emigrants in Bondage, Mr. Coldham has closed the remaining gaps. Altogether there are some 9,000 new and amended records in this important new work, which is arranged and annotated in the same way as the parent volume. To the original list of 50,000 records, these additions come as a windfall, arising from the availability of previously closed archival resources and the re-examination of conventional transportation records such as Assize Court records, Circuit Court records, and the quaintly-named Sheriffs' Cravings, to which can be added newspapers and printed memoirs.
The addition of 9,000 records to the canon makes this the most important list of ships' passengers to be published in years. Whether as a list of additions or corrections, this new work is an indispensable tool in the researcher's arsenal, and anyone using the parent volume and supplement cannot possibly ignore this volume. Questions about the peopling of colonial America come readily to mind when looking at a book like this—questions about ancestors, too—and the answers found here are both challenging and surprising.

[[Group identifier]]

CATEGORIES: Unix, Unix file system technology

In Unix-like systems, multiple users can be categorized into groups. POSIX and conventional Unix file system permissions are organized into three classes, user, group, and others. The use of groups allows additional abilities to be delegated in an organized fashion, such as access to disks, printers, and other peripherals. This method, among others, also enables the Superuser to delegate some administrative tasks to normal users, similar to the Administrators group on Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives.
A group identifier, often abbreviated to GID, is a numeric value used to represent a specific group. The range of values for a GID varies amongst different systems; at the very least, a GID can be between 0 and 32,767, with one restriction: the login group for the superuser must have GID 0. This numeric value is used to refer to groups in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files or their equivalents. Shadow password files and Network Information Service also refer to numeric GIDs. The group identifier is a necessary component of Unix file systems and processes.
The limits on the range of possible group identifiers come from the memory space used to store them. Originally, a signed 16-bit integer was used. Since the sign was not necessary—negative numbers do not make valid group IDs—an unsigned integer is now used instead, allowing group IDs between 0 and 65,535. Modern operating systems usually use unsigned 32-bit integers, which allow for group IDs between 0 and 4,294,967,295. The switch from 16 to 32 bits was originally not necessary—one machine or even one network did not serve more than 65,536 users at the time—but was made to eliminate the need to do so in the future, when it would be more difficult to implement.

[[Yerma]]

CATEGORIES: Plays by Federico García Lorca, 1934 plays

Yerma (i.e., "Barren" in Spanish) is a play by the Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written in 1934 and first performed that same year. Lorca describes the play as "a tragic poem." The play tells the story of a childless woman living in rural Spain. Her desperate desire for motherhood becomes an obsession that eventually drives her to commit a horrific crime. Because of the time she is living in, she is expected to bear children. When she cannot, she is forced to measures that those in her society would view as extreme. 
Although critics speculate that Yerma kills her husband in the end because he is a frugal, economically driven man who has no desire to have children, the play is indeterminate on this issue. She kills him at a hermitage, a religious place with the possibility of fertility. However he has already shown no desire to have children, so there is no evidence that he would have changed his mind at the festival.

HMS ''Jupiter was a Majestic''-class pre-dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy. Commissioned in 1897, she was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1905. After a refit, she was temporarily put in reserve before returning to service with the Channel Fleet in September 1905. In 1908 and rendered obsolete by the emergence of the dreadnought type of battleships, she once again returned to the reserve, this time with the Home Fleet. After another refit, she had a spell as a gunnery training ship in 1912.
Following the outbreak of World War I, Jupiter served with the Channel Fleet and then as a guard ship on the River Tyne. She was dispatched to Russia in February 1915 to serve as an icebreaker, clearing a route to Arkhangelsk while the regular icebreaker was undergoing a refit. She underwent her own refit later in 1915 and once completed, was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol. She returned to England late 1916, and spent the remainder of the war based at Devonport. She was scrapped in 1920.

Group C of UEFA Euro 2004 was one of four groups in the final tournament's initial group stage. It began on 14 June and was completed on 22 June. The group consisted of Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Bulgaria.
Sweden won the group and advanced to the quarter-finals, along with Denmark. Italy and Bulgaria failed to advance.
Three teams – Italy, Denmark and Sweden – all finished on an equal amount of points, with each team having defeated Bulgaria but drawn their two other games between one another. As all results between the three teams in question were draws, both the points won in these games and the goal difference accrued in these games still left the teams undivided. The decisive tiebreaker was therefore the goals scored during the games between one another: Italy having scored the least goals of the three teams were therefore eliminated.

Sir Ralph Freeman (27 November 1880 – 11 March 1950) was an English structural engineer, responsible for the design of several of the world's most impressive bridges.
Born in London, England, he studied at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and the City and Guilds of London Institute, and in 1901 joined Douglas Fox & Partners, a firm of consulting engineers specialising in the design of steel bridges. He rose to become senior partner and in 1938 the firm changed its name to Freeman Fox & Partners.
Sir Ralph is best remembered for his design work on the Victoria Falls Bridge (1905) and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932). He also designed the lesser known Birchenough Bridge (1935), which is a smaller replica of the Sydney bridge in the Chipinge area of Zimbabwe.Sir Ralph Freeman (1880-1950) | Structurae

The outcries of the monks at Orebro were heard as far as Upsala; and in July, 1523, Brask received from the chapter of this metropolitan town a letter in which he was informed that the Lutheran heresy was boldly preached in the cathedral of Strengnaes by one Olaf Petri. It appears that this information was absolutely new to the vehement bishop. Completely devoted to the Roman Church, not even imagining that there could be any other, he was greatly agitated. He heard shortly after that emissaries of the Lutheran propaganda had made their appearance in his own diocese. He looked on this as the beginning of a great conflagration which would consume the whole Church. | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J51KAAAAMAAJ&dq |isbn= [/tpl]

[[Vineland, Florida]]
CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Orange County, Florida, Greater Orlando, Unincorporated communities in Florida

Vineland is an unincorporated community in southwest Orange County, Florida, United States.  It is just north of Interstate 4 along State Road 535 and continues along County Road 435 which is South Apopka Vineland Rd .  The name is not used much any more, since the City of Lake Buena Vista lies just to the south and west and is a more well-known name.  Orange County officially calls the area Buena Vista North or Orange Center, its original name.  Mailing addresses for residents in the area is Orlando, Florida except many businesses in the area use Lake Buena Vista, Florida as their address.  The area is most famous because the name appears on a large number of major Orange County roads including Apopka-Vineland Road, Winter Garden-Vineland Road, Kissimmee-Vineland Road and Taft-Vineland Road. There was also a small town which was abandoned in the 1960s called Vineland. An ACL Railway Depot, Housing, a schoolhouse, a church, the Vineland Cemetery, and many more community facilities were a part of the original town. These roads begin/terminate in the area known as Vineland and Lake Buena Vista, Florida.
Vineland is mainly residential, with a mosque Jama Masjid of Orlando, 11543 Ruby Lake Rd, a synagogue Southwest Orlando Jewish 11200 S Apopka Vineland Rd and 4  shopping center areas with 15 plus restaurants and several hotels and time share resorts, and the eastern entrance to Walt Disney World on Hotel Plaza Blvd. being other land uses. There are about 50 houses in the neighborhood, apartment complex, Mobile Home park (55 yr,+) . It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The area was given the name Orange Center when it was platted in 1911. Previously it had the name Englewood, probably given to it by the Florida Midland Railroad. The name was changed to Vineland in 1924, supposedly due to confusion with Orange City, Florida.

[[UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage]]

CATEGORIES: UEFA Euro 2004

The UEFA Euro 2004 knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament involving the eight teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions.
Any game in the knockout stage that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves). For the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team who leads the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.
If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.
The knockout stage began with the quarter-finals on 24 June and ended with the final on 4 July 2004 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon. Greece won the tournament with a 1–0 victory over the host nation Portugal.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (commonly known as a TURP, plural TURPs, and rarely as a transurethral prostatic resection, TUPR) is a urological operation. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As the name indicates, it is performed by visualising the prostate through the urethra and removing tissue by electrocautery or sharp dissection. This is considered the most effective treatment for BPH. This procedure is done with spinal or general anaesthetic. A triple lumen catheter is inserted through the urethra to irrigate and drain the bladder after the surgical procedure is complete. Outcome is considered excellent for 80-90% of BPH patients.

Raymond Bernard Cattell (20 March 1905 – 2 February 1998) was a British and American psychologist, known for his exploration of many areas in psychology. These areas included: the basic dimensions of personality and temperament, a range of cognitive abilities, the dynamic dimensions of motivation and emotion, the clinical dimensions of personality, patterns of group and social behavior, applications of personality research to psychotherapy and learning theory, predictors of creativity and achievement, and many scientific research methods for exploring and measuring these areas. Cattell was famously productive throughout his 92 years, authoring and co-authoring over 50 books and 500 articles, and over 30 standardized tests.  According to a widely cited ranking, he was the 16th most influential and eminent psychologist of the 20th century.S. J. Haggbloom et al. (2002), "The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century", Review of General Psychology, 6(2), 139-152.  This empirical study used six criteria including citations, surveys, and awards to rank the eminence of psychologists.
As a psychologist, Cattell was rigorously devoted to the scientific method.  He was an early proponent of using factor analytical methods instead of what he called "verbal theorizing" to explore the basic dimensions of personality, motivation, and cognitive abilities. One of the most important results of Cattell's application of factor analysis was his discovery of 16 factors underlying human personality. He called these factors "source traits" because he believed they provide the underlying source for the surface behaviors we think of as personality.Richard Gerrig and Philip Zimbardo, Psychology and Life, 7th ed. This theory of personality factors and the instrument used to measure them are known respectively as the 16 personality factor model and the 16PF Questionnaire.
Although Cattell is best known for identifying the dimensions of personality, he also studied basic dimensions of other domains: intelligence, motivation, and vocational interests. Cattell theorized the existence of fluid and crystallized intelligences to explain human cognitive ability, and authored the Culture Fair Intelligence Test to minimize the bias of written language and cultural background in intelligence testing.

CATEGORIES: Emergency medical equipment, Orthopedic braces, Protective gear

A cervical collar (also neck brace) is an orthopedic medical device used to support a patient's neck and head.  It is also used by emergency personnel for those who have had traumatic head or neck injuries,[tpl]cite book|last=Mistovich|first=Joseph J.|author2=Brent Q. Hafen|author3=Keith J Karren|title=Brady Prehospital Emergency Care|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|year=2000|edition=6|pages=662|isbn=0-8359-6064-1[/tpl] and can be used to treat chronic medical conditions.
Whenever patients have a traumatic head or neck injury, they may have a cervical fracture.  This makes them at high risk for spinal cord injury, which could be exacerbated by movement of the patient and could lead to paralysis or death. A common scenario for this injury would be a patient suspected of having whiplash because of a car accident.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/whiplash|title=Whiplash|accessdate=2008-03-07|publisher=WebMD[/tpl] In order to prevent further injury, such patients may have a collar placed by medical professionals until X-rays can be taken to determine if a cervical spine fracture exists.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/neck-strain|title=Neck Strains|accessdate=2008-03-07|publisher=WebMD[/tpl] The cervical collar only stabilizes the top seven vertebrae, C1 through C7. (Other immobilizing devices such as a Kendrick Extrication Device or a backboard can be used to stabilize the remainder of the spinal column.)
Cervical collars are also used therapeutically to help realign the spinal cord and relieve pain,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/physical-therapy-other-options|title=Cervical Disc Disease Treatment: Physical Therapy and Other Options|accessdate=2008-03-07|publisher=WebMD[/tpl] although they are usually not worn for long periods of time.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/tc/office-ergonomics-other-treatment-for-injuries-related-to-the-workstation|title=Office Ergonomics - Other Treatment for Injuries Related to the Workstation|accessdate=2008-03-07|publisher=WebMD[/tpl] Another use of the cervical collar is for strains,  sprains or whiplash. If pain is persistent, the collar might be required to remain attached to help in the healing process. A patient may also need a cervical collar, or may require a halo fixation device to support the neck during recovery after surgery such as cervical spinal fusion.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cervical-spinal-fusion|title=Cervical spinal fusion|accessdate=2008-03-07|publisher=WebMD[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Dukes of Nemours, House of Savoy, House of Orléans, Duchesses of Nemours

In the 12th and 13th centuries the Lordship of Nemours, in the Gatinais, France, was in possession of the house of Villebeon, a member of which, Gautier, was marshal of France in the middle of the 13th century. The lordship was sold to King Philip III of France in 1274 and 1276 by Jean and Philippe de Nemours, and was then made a county and given to Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch in 1364. 
In 1404, Charles VI of France gave it to Charles III of Navarre, and erected it into a duchy in the peerage of France, in exchange to his ancestral county of Évreux in Normandy.
After being confiscated and restored several times, the duchy reverted to the French crown in 1504, after the extinction of the house of Armagnac-Pardiac. In 1507 it was given by Louis XII of France to his nephew, Gaston de Foix, who was killed at the Battle of Ravenna in 1512. The duchy then returned to the royal domain, and was detached from it successively for Giuliano de Medici and his wife Philiberta of Savoy in 1515, for Louise of Savoy in 1524, and for Philip of Savoy, Count of Genevois, in 1528. 
The descendants of the last-mentioned duke possessed the duchy until its sale to Louis XIV of France. In 1672 Louis gave it to his brother Philippe de France, Duke of Orleans, whose descendants possessed it until the French Revolution. It was one of the many subsidiary titles held by the House of Orléans. 
The title of Duke of Nemours was afterwards given to Louis Charles, son of King Louis Philippe of the French.

John Graves Shedd (July 20, 1850[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]October 22, 1926) was the second president and chairman of the board of Marshall Field & Company.
Born on a New Hampshire farm, Shedd arrived in Chicago, Illinois in 1871 and began working as a stock clerk for Marshall Field. By 1901, he had worked his way up to a vice-presidency and took over as president upon Field's death in 1906. Field himself described Shedd as "the greatest merchant in the United States," and, indeed, under Shedd's presidency Marshall Field & Company became the largest store in Chicago and the largest wholesale and dry goods company in the world.
Shedd was a civic leader and founding member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, which continues to play an active role in the city's efforts to maintain itself as a world-class metropolis. One of the Commercial Club's most notable undertakings was the sponsorship of Edward Bennett and Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago, which was released in 1909 and which to this day is considered to be one of the most important urban planning documents ever created.
One of Chicago's major philanthropists, he contributed extensively to Chicago charities, universities and museums, and in the early 1920s he provided $3 million to build Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, as a complement to The Field Museum (founded in 1892 as a part of the World's Columbian Exposition and renamed in honor of Marshall Field in 1905) and The Art Institute of Chicago (whose current building was also a product of the 1892 World's Columbian Exposition). Completed in 1930, the Shedd Aquarium remained the world's largest aquarium for most of the century.
In 1920, Shedd provided the funds for the construction of the Shedd-Porter Memorial Library in Alstead, New Hampshire.
In 2002, The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts, a community-based performing arts center and music school in Eugene, Oregon, was co-founded by one of his great-grandchildren.
With his wife, Mary Roanna (nee Porter) (Dec. 18, 1863 - Apr. 17, 1942), they had daughters Helen Shedd Reed Keith and Laura Abbie Shedd Schweppe (? - Apr 21, 1937). Laura married Charles Hodgdon Schweppe (1881 - Sep 1941) on 22 February 1913.

[[Packard V-1650]]
CATEGORIES: Aircraft piston engines 1940–1949, Packard aircraft engines

The Packard V-1650 was a version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine, produced under licence in the United States by the Packard Motor Car Company.Gunston 1995, p. 144. The engine was licensed in order to provide a [tpl]convert|1,500|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl]-class design at a time when U.S. engines of this rating were not considered ready for use even after years of development.
The first V-1650s, with a simple one-stage supercharger, were used in the P-40F Kittyhawk fighter. Later versions included a much more advanced two-stage supercharger for greatly improved performance at high altitudes. It found its most famous application in the North American P-51 Mustang fighter, where it vastly improved that aircraft's performance at altitude, transforming the Mustang into an outstanding fighter with the range and performance to escort heavy bombers over the European continent. By 1944, P-51B, P-51C and P-51D "Merlin" Mustangs were able to escort Allied heavy bombers in daylight all the way to Berlin and yet were still capable of combating German fighters attempting to intercept the bombers. By late 1944, the Allies had won air supremacy over the whole of Germany, and Germany's defeat in World War II began to appear inevitable.

The Kendrick Extrication Device (K.E.D.) is a device that is used in vehicle extrication to remove victims of traffic collisions from motor vehicles. Commonly carried on ambulances, the K.E.D. is typically applied by an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or another first responder. Typically used in conjunction with a cervical collar, the K.E.D. is a semi-rigid brace that secures the head, neck and torso in an anatomically neutral position. This position reduces the possibility of additional injuries to these regions during extrication. The original K.E.D. was designed by Richard Kendrick in 1978.K.E.D.

Thomas Coryat (also Coryate) (c. 1577 – 1617) was an English traveller and writer of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age.  He is principally remembered for two volumes of writings he left regarding his travels, often on foot, through Europe and parts of Asia.  He is often credited with introducing the table fork to England, with "Furcifer" (Latin: fork-bearer, rascal) becoming one of his nicknames.Michael Strachan, "Coryate, Thomas (c. 1577–1617)", in Literature of Travel and Exploration: an Encyclopedia, 2003, Volume 1, pp.285–87 His description of how the Italians shielded themselves from the sun resulted in the word "umbrella" being introduced into English. 
He was born in Crewkerne, Somerset,[tpl]cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0-906456-98-3 |page=96 [/tpl] and lived most of his life in the Somerset village of Odcombe. He was educated at Winchester College and Gloucester Hall, Oxford, and later was employed by Prince Henry, eldest son of James I as a sort of "court jester".  In 1608 he undertook a tour of Europe, somewhat less than half of which he walked, and published his memoirs of the events in a volume entitled Coryat's Crudities hastily gobbled up in Five Months Travels in France, Italy, &c' (1611).[tpl]cite book|last=Byford|first=Enid|title=Somerset Curiosities|date=1987|publisher=Dovecote Press|isbn=0946159483|page=19[/tpl]  This volume gives a vivid picture of life in Europe during the time; it is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe, including an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others.  
Later in 1611 he published a second volume of travel writings, this one entitled Coryats Crambe, or his Coleworte twice Sodden.
Ever restless, he set out once again in 1612, this time on a journey that would ultimately lead to Asia, visiting Greece, the eastern Mediterranean area, Persia, and eventually India.  From Agra and elsewhere he sent letters describing his experiences; his Greetings from the Court of the Great Mogul was published in London in 1616, and a similar volume of his letters home appeared in 1618.  Coryat died of dysentery while traveling in Surat in 1617.  Though his planned account of the journey would never be, some of his unorganized travel notes have survived and found their way back to England.  These were published in the 1625 edition of Samuel Purchas's  Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas his Pilgrimes, contayning a History of the World in Sea Voyages and Lande Travells, by Englishmen and others.
Coryat's writings were hugely popular at the time.  His accounts of inscriptions, many of which are now lost, were valuable; and his accounts of Italian customs and manners—including the use of the table fork—were influential in England at a time when other aspects of Italian culture, such as the madrigal, had already been in vogue for more than twenty years.
Coryat is considered by many to have been the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe; a practice which became a mainstay of the education of British upper class men in the 18th century.
British travel writer and humorist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat's tour of Europe, as recounted in his book Continental Drifter (2000). In 2008 Daniel Allen published an account of his nine-month cycle trip following Coryate's journey to the East, entitled The Sky Above, The Kingdom Below.

Where Eagles Dare is a 1968 World War II action film starring Richard Burton, Clint Eastwood and Mary Ure.  It was directed by Brian G. Hutton and shot on location in Austria and Bavaria. Alistair MacLean wrote the novel and the screenplay at the same time. It was his first screenplay; both film and book became commercial successes.
The film involved some of the top moviemaking professionals of the time and is considered a classic. Major contributors included Hollywood stuntman Yakima Canutt, who, as second-unit director, shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman Alf Joint, who doubled for Burton in such sequences as the fight on top of the cable car; award-winning conductor and composer Ron Goodwin, who wrote the film score, and future Oscar-nominee Arthur Ibbetson, who worked on its cinematography.

[[Extension cord]]
CATEGORIES: Power cables, Consumer electronics, Electrical wiring

An extension cord, power extender, or extension lead is a length of flexible electrical power cable (flex) with a plug on one end and one or more sockets on the other end (usually of the same type as the plug). The term usually refers to mains (household AC) extensions but is also used to refer to extensions for other types of cabling. If the plug and receptacle are of different types, the term "adapter cord" may be used. Extension cable is also used, but that has a distinct meaning from extension cord for many people.  Because an extension cord always has a plug and one or more sockets attached, and because the term "cord" may also be used generically to mean just a length of two or more wires enclosed in a sheath, an extension cord is sometimes referred to as a "cord set".

CATEGORIES: Novels by James A. Michener, 1965 novels, Historical novels, Jewish history, History of Palestine, History of Israel, Random House books, Novels set in Israel

The Source is a historical novel by James A. Michener, first published in 1965.  It is a survey of the history of the Jewish people and the land of Israel from pre-monotheistic days to the birth of the modern State of Israel.  The Source uses, for its central device, a fictional tell in northern Israel called "Makor" ([tpl]lang-he|"source"[/tpl]).
Unlike most Michener novels, this book is not in strict chronological order. A parallel frame story set in modern-day Israel supports the historical timeline. Archaeologists digging at the tell at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The book follows the story of the Family of Ur from a Stone Age family whose wife begins to believe that there is a supernatural force, which slowly leads us to the beginnings of monotheism. The descendants are not aware of the ancient antecedents revealed to the reader by the all-knowing writer as the story progresses through the Davidic kingdom, Hellenistic times, Roman times, etc.  The site is continually inhabited until the end of the Crusades when it is destroyed by the victorious Mameluks (as happened to many actual cities after 1291) and is not rebuilt by the Ottomans.

Anatole Kaletsky (born June 1, 1952) is an economist and journalist based in the United Kingdom. He has written since 1976 for The Economist, The Financial Times and The Times of London before joining Reuters and The International Herald Tribune in 2012. He has been named Newspaper Commentator of the Year in the BBC’s What the Papers Say awards, and has twice received the British Press Award for Specialist Writer of the Year.
He has been an economic consultant since 1997, providing policy analysis and asset allocation advice to over 800 financial institutions, multinational companies and international organisations through his company, GaveKal, which is co-run with Louis and Charles Gave. He was elected to the governing Council of the Royal Economic Society in 1998.
Kaletsky was born in 1952 in Moscow, USSR and also spent his childhood in Poland and Australia. He has lived in England and the US since 1966. Mr Kaletsky was educated at King's College at the University of Cambridge where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Mathematics and at Harvard University, where he was a Kennedy Memorial Scholar and gained a master's degree in Economics. He is married to Fiona Murphy, a documentary film producer and they have three children: Kitty, Misha, and Sasha. In 1976 he joined The Economist, writing about business and finance. Three years later he moved to the Financial Times, working in a variety of posts including New York Bureau Chief, Washington Correspondent, International Economics Correspondent and Moscow Correspondent.
Beginning in 1990 he was Economics Editor of The Times, and later became Editor-at-Large. In early 2012, Kaletsky began his new post, in the Analysis and Opinion section of the Reuters online newspaper, where he writes a weekly column. His articles also appear in print around the world in the International Herald Tribune. Like many economists, he has made predictions that were contradicted by subsequent events, and this tendency was noted by the satirical magazine Private Eye. For example, Kaletsky wrote, "… I am one of the few economic commentators who has consistently made light of the anxieties about a “day of reckoning” for British homeowners and consumers …"Anatole Kaletsky Britain doesn't have to make things to boom 19 August 2004
In 2010, Kaletsky suggested the emergence of a new form of capitalism, which he calls Capitalism 4.0. The book's writing was primarily influenced by the subprime mortgage crises of 2007 to 2009; and draws upon the pattern or the fallibility of capitalism.Private Eye, 2 Oct - 15 Oct 2009, Issue No. 1246, p.9.  In his book Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis, Kaletsky suggests that capitalism is "not a static set of institutions but an evolutionary system that reinvents and reinvigorates itself through crisis.Kaletsky, A.

Alexander "Sawney" Bean was the semi-mythical head of a 48-member clan in 15th- or 16th-century Scotland, reportedly executed for the mass murder and cannibalisation of over 1,000 people.
The story appears in The Newgate Calendar, a crime catalogue of the notorious Newgate Prison in London. While historians tend to believe that Sawney Bean never existed or that his story has been greatly exaggerated, his story has passed into local folklore and is part of the Edinburgh tourism industry.

Eucryphia is a small genus of trees and large shrubs of the Antarctic flora, native to the south temperate regions of South America and coastal eastern Australia. Traditionally placed in a family of their own, the Eucryphiaceae, more recent classifications place them in the Cunoniaceae. There are seven species, two in South America and five in Australia, and several named hybrids. They are mostly evergreen though one species (E. glutinosa) is usually deciduous.
The leaves are opposite, and either simple or pinnate with 3-13 leaflets. The flowers are produced in late summer or autumn, are showy and sweetly scented, 3-6 cm diameter, with four creamy-white petals, and numerous stamens and styles. The fruit is a woody capsule 1-1.5 cm long containing several seeds, and maturing in 12-15 months.
The generic name is derived from the Greek for "well hidden".

[[Hi Infidelity]]

CATEGORIES: REO Speedwagon albums, 1980 albums, Epic Records albums

Hi Infidelity is the ninth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). It went on to become the biggest selling rock LP of 1981, eventually selling over ten million copies. Six songs from this album hit Billboard charts, including "Keep On Loving You" which was the band's first Number 1 hit, and "Take It on the Run", which reached No. 5 on the charts. The album title is a play on the term Hi-Fi (high fidelity), and the album art is an illustration of this pun where an act of sexual infidelity is occurring while the man is putting a record LP to play on the hi-fi stereo.
In October 2004, the band recorded the songs of this album live from beginning to end for an XM Radio "Then Again Live" special.
On July 21, 2011, Sony Music rereleased Hi Infidelity with Bonus Demo tracks for the album's 30th anniversary.

[[Online codes]]

CATEGORIES: Coding theory

In computer science, online codes are an example of rateless erasure codes. These codes can encode a message into a number of symbols such that knowledge of any fraction of them allows one to recover the original message (with high probability). Rateless codes produce an arbitrarily large number of symbols which can be broadcast until the receivers have enough symbols.
The online encoding algorithm consists of several phases. First the message is split into n fixed size message blocks. Then the outer encoding is an erasure code which produces auxiliary blocks that are appended to the message blocks to form a composite message.
From this the inner encoding generates check blocks. Upon receiving a certain number of check blocks some fraction of the composite message can be recovered. Once enough has been recovered the outer decoding can be used to recover the original message.

[[Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd.]]

CATEGORIES: Manufacturing companies of Scotland, Engineering companies of the United Kingdom, Electrical engineering companies of the United Kingdom

Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. was an Edinburgh industrial electrical engineering company founded as D. Bruce Peebles & Co. by Scottish engineer David Bruce Peebles (1826–1899) in Edinburgh in 1866. 
The company initially specialised in gas engineering but later expanded to include electrical engineering as well. It continued to trade after Peebles' death and, in 1902, the name was changed to Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. The company held the British manufacturing rights for the Cascade converter and a license to manufacture three phase electrical equipment designed by Ganz of Budapest. 
In 1903, Peebles expanded into Canada. Along with other investors, it formed the Canadian Electric Traction Company
and supplied the three-phase equipment, car motors and generatorshttp://www.trainweb.org/swtractionco/equipment/swtroster.html for theSouth Western Traction Company of London, Ontario. 
The mainline ran 28-miles between London and Port Stanley, a resort town on Lake Erie. It was the only three-phase traction line in Canada, and was closed in 1918.http://www.trainweb.org/swtractionco/swthistory.html
In 1904 the company opened a new factory at a site in East Pilton, Edinburgh, employing 3,000 at its peak in the 1950s. The works had its own internal railway system, which was electrified and used electric shunting locomotives built by Peebles themselves. This was the first electric line in Edinburgh (main line electrification did not reach Edinburgh until the early 1990s). In 1905 the company was exhibiting at the Third International Electric Tramway and Railway Exhibition.
During both World Wars, the works produced shells, submarine and aircraft parts, tank and electrical equipment such as mobile search lights and minesweeping units.It also manufactured at least one (from an order of ten) electric locomotives for the Portmadoc, Beddgelert & South Snowdon Railway.
It was the main sub contractor for the electrification of the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield from 1947–1954, a major engineering achievement. Throughout this period it specialised in large scale transformers for power stations, including the world's largest 400kV 'quadrature booster' for the UK national grid. It also produced heavy electrical motors for various uses, including railway locomotives.
In 1969 the company became part of the Reyrolle and Parsons Group and by the late 1990s it was owned by Rolls-Royce plc and the Austrian company VA Tech.
Many young electrical engineers were taken on by this company, with a special course in electrical engineering being run at the nearby Telford College. They gained skills in highly specialised work, and Peebles' products were exported all over the world. The late Ron Brown, MP for Leith, was employed by the company, as was the late Sir Duncan McDonald who was the chief transformer designer.1
In 1998 Rolls Royce sold the transformer part of the Parsons Peebles Motor & Generators and the Reyrolle switchgear to VA TECH of Austria who traded as VA TECH Peebles initially in East Pilton. 
The April 1999 fire destroyed the main transformer works in East Pilton and the transformer company decided that a replacement factory should be relocated to Leith and the Pilton site vacated. Peebles electrical machines then relocated to Wood Road in the nearby Rosyth royal dockyard. VA TECH closed the Leith factory during 2005 and continued service work only. The entire VA TECH company later became part of Siemens.
In 1999 Rolls Royce sold the Electrical Machines business which was later named Peebles Electrical Machines Limited in May 1999. The BDG Group then purchased Peebles electrical machines in 2002 and ran the company until 2005 when Paterson Quarries took control. 
Today Parson Peebles Motor & Generators is part of Clyde Blowers Capital having been acquired in January 2013. CBC owner Jim McColl told the Scotsman newspaper on 22 January 2013 it was a “fantastic opportunity” to acquire a Scottish engineering firm with global growth potential. The company is still located in the Royal dockyard Rosyth and continues to manufacture and service specialised motors and generators

[[Thermoforming]]

CATEGORIES: Plastics industry, Packaging

Thermoforming is a manufacturing process where a plastic sheet is heated to a pliable forming temperature, formed to a specific shape in a mold, and trimmed to create a usable product. The sheet, or "film" when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough temperature that it can be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a finished shape. 
In its simplest form, a small tabletop or lab size machine can be used to heat small cut sections of plastic sheet and stretch it over a mold using vacuum. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. In complex and high-volume applications, very large production machines are utilized to heat and form the plastic sheet and trim the formed parts from the sheet in a continuous high-speed process, and can produce many thousands of finished parts per hour depending on the machine and mold size and the size of the parts being formed.
Thermoforming differs from injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding and other forms of processing plastics. Thin-gauge thermoforming is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge thermoforming includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds, and plastic pallets.
In the most common method of high-volume, continuous thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to forming temperature. The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum in the case of taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.
Most thermoforming companies recycle their scrap and waste plastic, either by compressing in a baling machine or by feeding into a granulator (grinder) and producing ground flake, for sale to reprocessing companies or re-use in their own facility. Frequently, scrap and waste plastic from the thermoforming process is converted back into extruded sheet for forming again.

Vacuum forming is a simplified version of thermoforming, whereby a sheet of plastic is heated to a forming temperature, stretched onto a convex, or into a concave, single-surface mold, and forced against the mold by a vacuum (suction of air). The vacuum forming process can be used to make most product packaging and speaker casings.  It is also used to fabricate car dashboards. The first commercial manufacturer of vacuum-formed plastics was Robinson Industries of Coleman, Michigan.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.robinsonind.com | title=Robinson Industries[/tpl]

The 1998 National League Championship Series (NLCS), to determine the champion of Major League Baseball's National League, was played from October 7 to 14 between the East Division champion Atlanta Braves and the West Division champion San Diego Padres.
The Braves entered the playoffs for the seventh straight season with a franchise-record 106 regular season wins, an offense that hit 215 home runs, and a pitching staff made up of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Denny Neagle, and Kevin Millwood to the playoffs.  However, they also carried the baggage of their embarrassing NLCS loss to the Florida Marlins the previous season. In the NLDS, the Braves swept Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs.
After a 76–86 season in 1997, San Diego stormed out and took control of their division, finishing with a 98–64 record, their best in team history. The offense was led by the 50 home run club's newest member, Greg Vaughn, and by Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. The San Diego rotation was anchored by eighteen-game winner Kevin Brown, who helped Florida defeat Atlanta in the 1997 NLCS, along with All-Star Andy Ashby and the series MVP Sterling Hitchcock. Closer Trevor Hoffman saved an astounding 53 games in the regular season. The Padres defeated the favored Houston Astros in four games in the NLDS.
It was the seventh-consecutive NLCS appearance for the Braves and they would be heavily favored against the Padres.

[[Tooth bleaching]]

CATEGORIES: Dentistry procedures

Dental bleaching, also known as tooth whitening, is a common procedure in general dentistry. According to the FDA, whitening restores natural tooth color and bleaching whitens beyond the natural color. There are many methods available, such as brushing, bleaching strips, bleaching pen, bleaching gel, and laser bleaching. Teeth whitening has become the most requested procedure in cosmetic dentistry today. More than 100 million Americans whiten their teeth one way or another; spending an estimated $15 billion in 2010.Krupp, Charla. (2008). How Not To Look Old. New York: Springboard Press, p.95.
Bleaching methods use carbamide peroxide which reacts with water to form hydrogen peroxide. Carbamide peroxide has about a third of the strength of hydrogen peroxide. This means that a 15% solution of carbamide peroxide is the rough equivalent of a 5% solution of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide oxidizing agent penetrates the porosities in the rod-like crystal structure of enamel and breaks down stain deposits in  the dentin. Power bleaching uses light to accelerate the process of bleaching in a dental office. Another bleaching agent is 6-phthalimido peroxy hexanoic acid (PAP).
Tooth bleaching is not a modern invention. Ancient Romans, for example, used urine and goat milk in an attempt to make and keep their teeth whiter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-teeth-whitening.html| title=The History of Teeth Whitening – Smiles Through the Miles|date= 09-11-2008|accessdate= 2012-02-13[/tpl]

[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]

CATEGORIES: Works about the American Revolution, Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cultural depictions of George Washington, New Jersey in the American Revolution, Pennsylvania in the American Revolution, 1851 paintings

Washington Crossing the Delaware is an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by the German American artist Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze. It commemorates General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River on the night of December 25–26, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. That action was the first move in a surprise attack against the Hessian forces at Trenton, New Jersey in the Battle of Trenton.
The original was part of the collection at the Kunsthalle in Bremen, Germany and was destroyed in a British air raid in 1942. Leutze painted a second version which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  There are many copies, one of which is in the West Wing reception area of the White House.

The 1992–93 FA Premier League was the first season of the Premier League, the top division of English football. The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993. The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from The Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season. The new league was backed up by a five-year, £305 million deal with BSkyB to televise Premier League matches. In concept, the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League, which was now reduced to three divisions.

[[Lucas–Carmichael number]]

CATEGORIES: Integer sequences

In mathematics, a Lucas–Carmichael number is a positive composite integer n such that if p is a prime factor of n, then p + 1 is a factor of n + 1. 
By convention, a number is only regarded as a Lucas–Carmichael number if it is odd and square-free (not divisible by the square of a prime number), otherwise any cube of a prime number, such as 8 or 27, would be a Lucas–Carmichael number (since n3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n2 − n + 1) is always divisible by n + 1).
Thus the smallest such number is 399 = 3 × 7 × 19; 399+1 = 400; 3+1, 7+1 and 19+1 are all factors of 400. 
The first few numbers, and their factors, are [tpl]OEIS|id=A006972[/tpl]:
The smallest LucasCarmichael number with 5 factors is 588455 = 5 × 7 × 17 × 23 × 43.
It is not known whether any Lucas–Carmichael number is also a Carmichael number.

[[Jimi Mbaye]]
CATEGORIES: Senegalese guitarists, Living people

Mamadou "Jimi" Mbaye is a Senegalese guitarist best known for his work with Youssou N'dour. Mbaye has developed a unique Senegalese guitar style in which he makes his Fender Stratocaster sound like local instruments such as the kora or xalam.
Mbaye is very different from other guitarists because of his unique style of playing guitar. Youssou Ndour used to say "no one, no one plays guitar like Jimi Mbaye. His playing style is unique". Mbaye succeeded to transpose the African traditional sounds of khalam (Ngoni) and kora onto his electric Fender Stratocaster. Jimi has also proven to be good singer, very melodic, a true harmonicist. Carlos Santana and Mbaye met during a tour in Los Angeles where Carlos acknowledged that: "Jimi is a very special and incredible guitarist".
Mbaye has released three solo albums, "Dakar Heart", "Yaye Digalma" and "Khare Dounya". The latter was recorded in Jimi's new studio Studio Dogo, in which he produces other artists. 
At ten years old Mbaye built his first guitar out of fishing line and gasoline cans. At twenty he'd scraped up enough money to buy a second hand Fender Stratocaster. Mbaye was just as determined to get a guitar as he was to make it in the competitive Dakar music scene. 
Early on he met Youssou N'Dour and together they became rising stars on Senegal's club scene, playing mbalax music. They created the "Super Etoile" band together in 1979 and have been musically inseparable for all these years.
Mbaye recorded six top-selling major-label albums with N'Dour before taking a leave of absence to record his own solo album, released in 1997, Dakar Heart. Recorded at N'Dour's Studio Xippi, Dakar Heartfeatures N'Dour's band "Super Etoile". Mbaye is back at N'Dour's side and is very much an integral part of Youssou's "Super Etoile" band these days. In fact, Youssou often travels abroad only with Mbaye as acoustic guitar accompanist, as he did in June 1998 for performances in Paris as guests of Brazilian performer Gilberto Gil at the Olympia Theatre.
A member of Youssou N'Dour's Super Etoile Band since 1979, Mbaye is one of Senegal's most influential guitarists. Often compared to Jimi Hendrix and Robert Johnson, Mbaye has forged a unique blend of traditional Senegalese roots music and American pop and R&B. Recording a solo album, Dakar Heart, with help from Super Etoile Band musicians in 1997, Mbaye showcased his inventive, kora-derived guitar playing and singing in Wolof, English, and French. Billboard called him "a prodigious world talent," while Rhythm referred to him as "one of Senegal's most exciting musicians." Music has played an ongoing role in Mbaye's life. As a youngster, he performed on a self-invented instrument made from discarded garbage cans and nylon fishing line in the streets of Dakar. By the age of 20, he had graduated to a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Mbaye continues to be the backbone of N'Dour's band. In addition to co-writing the 1994 single "Mame Bamba," he has made valuable contributions to six N'Dour recordings. Mbaye and N'Dour have increasingly performed as a duo. In 1998, they opened the show for Brazilian guitarist Gilberto Gil at the Olympic Theater in Paris.
Mbaye is one of Africa's greatest guitarists. He has played in Youssou N'dour's Super Etoile since 1979. Now he has a solo album, Dakar Heart, on which he sings as well as plays guitar. The album is available from Shanachie Records, catalog #64094. In Europe, it's distributed by BMG France.
Dakar Heart skillfully blends Senegalese mbalax with American pop & R&B for a powerful new sound.
Here's what some of the critics are saying about Dakar Heart:
- UCLA DAILY BRUIN (Los Angeles) Oct. 13, 1997
"Poetic and achingly beautiful, Dakar Heart takes 'world music' to new heights. Alternately political and personal, and always passionate, the record reveals Mbaye as a true artist and lyricist. His songs are filled with love, hope and a desperate cry for peace, whether it be peace between nations or peace with one's soul. Dakar Heart is an elegant masterpiece."
- BILLBOARD magazine, Oct. 4 1997
"The solo debut for Youssou N'dour's guitarist Jimi Mbaye shines a deserved spotlight on a prodigious world music talent."
- RHYTHM MUSIC magazine, March 1998
"Mbaye continues to prove he is one of Senegal's most exciting musicians"
- RHYTHM MUSIC magazine, March 1998
Jimi Mbaye is a Senegalese guitarist best known for his work with Youssou N'dour. Mamadou 'Jimi' Mbaye has developed a unique Senegalese guitar style in which he makes his FenderStratocaster sound like local instruments such as the kora or xalam.
Jimi has released three solo albums, "Dakar Heart" and "Yaye Digalma" and in 2012 he released “Khare Dounya”. He has his own studio, Studio Dogo, in which he produces albums for other artists.
The second album called “Yaye Digalma” is a real masterpiece in which Jimi shows he’s a great singer. It’s a very melodic album dobbled which an arsenal of arrangements. So sweet to listen. He covered a song of Peter Gabriel with a duet with Kate Bush “Don’t Give Up”. He sang himself the two voices.
The third album called “Khare Dounya” was released in 2012. “Khare Dounya” means “Fight for Life”. He recorded this album with his band “Group Dogo”. It’s an album where Mbaye shows really his musicality. He started to tour with his band around the country (Senegal) and the West African region.
Since he had his studio Mbaye often collaborated with many artists from Africa and the rest of the world. We remember the album Daxaar with the late jazz drummer Steve Reid recorded in Mbaye’s studio Dogo in Dakar.
He’s friendly with all musicians. During gigs he used to be rehearsing with artists to make new songs artists can record after for their career. Here with Rokya Traore backstage during Youssou’s annual Bercy show in Paris.
He often produces some musicians in Senegal. He helped them to record. And sometimes when he’s not busy he jump on stage to perform with them. For example here with rising star Pape Diouf in Dakar
Now Mbaye has quit Super Etoile de Dakar to take care of his own solo career and has started to tour with  his Group Dogo all around the world. Here Mbaye on stage rocking the house.

CATEGORIES: Complexity classes

[tpl]unsolved|computer science|Is L [tpl]=[/tpl] NL ?[/tpl]
In computational complexity theory, NL (Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space) is the complexity class containing decision problems which can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine using a logarithmic amount of memory space.
NL is a generalization of L, the class for logspace problems on a deterministic Turing machine.  Since any deterministic Turing machine is also a nondeterministic Turing machine, we have that L is contained in NL.
NL can be formally defined in terms of the computational resource nondeterministic space (or NSPACE) as NL = NSPACE(log n).
Important results in complexity theory allow us to relate this complexity class with other classes, telling us about the relative power of the resources involved.  Results in the field of algorithms, on the other hand, tell us which problems can be solved with this resource.  Like much of complexity theory, many important questions about NL are still open (see Unsolved problems in computer science).
Occasionally NL is referred to as RL due to its probabilistic definition below; however, this name is more frequently used to refer to randomized logarithmic space, which is not known to equal NL.

[[Cascade converter]]

CATEGORIES: Electric power systems components

A cascade converter is a type of motor-generator which was patented in 1902 by J. L. la Cour and O. S. Bragstad.
It consists of an induction motor driving a dynamo through a shaft.  In addition, the rotor of the induction motor is electrically connected to the armature of the dynamo.
When the machine is running, half the power is transmitted mechanically through the shaft while the other half is transmitted electrically.  
The advantage of this arrangement is that the machine can be smaller than a conventional motor-generator of the same power.
The British manufacturing rights for the cascade converter were held by Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh.

[[Hellanodikai]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Olympic Games, Ancient Greek titles

The Hellanodikai ([tpl]lang-grc|[tpl]lang|grc|Ἑλλανοδίκαι[/tpl][/tpl],  literally meaning Judges of the Greeks) were the judges of the Ancient Olympic Games, and the success of the games are attributed to their efforts. It was their sacred duty to maintain the standards and legacy of the games, as well as uphold the rules. Originally the title was Agonothetai (meaning game organisers), but was changed to Hellanodikai soon after.
Originally, there was only one Hellanodikos, but this expanded, reaching as high as twelve members and then settling on ten in 348 BC. They supervised individual events, with a senior Hellanodikos as an overseer.
Hellanodikai were handpicked from people living in the region of Elis, as Elis was responsible for the running of the Olympics. Originally the post was hereditary, but this was changed, and an Elean from each of the ruling families were elected as a Hellanodikos. Their post only lasted for one Olympiad, and elections took place for each of the subsequent games.
Besides being judges and umpires, the Hellanodikai also were the general organisers, and were present at every ceremony and event that took place, having the honour of presenting the crowns and palm branches to the winners. They were also expected to police the games.
In the ten months preceding the games, the Hellanodikai lived in a specially made building in Elis, called the Hellanodikaion. This building was close to the gymnasiums where the athletes trained in preparation for the games. While staying at the Hellanodikaion, they were trained by the nomophylakes (νομοφύλακες, meaning 'guardians of the law') in the rules and regulations of the olympic games.
Another task for the Hellanodikai was to supervise the training of the athletes, where they selected those who were well trained, rejecting those who were not performing at a satisfactory level. The trainers for the individual athletes had to be present, but could not intervene or they were punished accordingly. They evaluated each athlete on behaviour, character and morality, as well as the more standard attributes such as power, stamina, and resistance. Those that were approved were entered into a special list called the leukoma (λεύκωμα).
Two days before the games, the athletes which were eligible left Elis for Olympia, in a procession led by the Hellanodikai.
The Hellanodikai were renowned for their fairness, and the public held them in high regard. While bribery and cheating among the athletes was commonplace, there was only one recorded case of corruption among the judges, where a Hellanodikos won two equestrian events. To remain impartial, the Hellanodikai were no longer allowed to participate in the games, and this remained the only blemish on their otherwise impeccable record.

The rustling of the leaves on an Oak tree was regarded as the voice of Zeus."Plants of Life, Plants of Death" Frederick J. Simoons 1998

[[Ford flathead V8 engine]]

CATEGORIES: Ford engines

The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or simply flatty, when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) was a flathead V8 engine designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees. During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the "Ford V‑8", after its new engine. When the engine was introduced in 1932, it was a market first in several respects: in cars that were affordable to the emerging mass market consumer, it was the first 8-cylinder, the first V8, and the first V engine to become widely available in automobiles. It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.[tpl]Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=231[/tpl]. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones,[tpl]Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=229[/tpl]. was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market. The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century. It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed.

CATEGORIES: Creator gods, Middle Eastern mythology, Yazidi, Indo-European mythology, Peafowls

Melek Taus ([tpl]lang-fa|ملك طاووس[/tpl]), or the Peacock Angel, is the Yazidi name for the central figure of their faith.
In the Yazidi belief system, God created the world, and the world is now in the care of a Heptad of seven Holy Beings, often known as Angels or heft sirr (the Seven Mysteries). Preeminent among these is Tawûsê Melek (frequently known as "Melek Taus" in English publications), the Peacock Angel. According to the Encyclopedia of the Orient,
[tpl]Quote|The reason for the Yazidis reputation of being devil worshipers is connected to the other name of Melek Taus, Shaytan, the same name the Koran has for Satan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/uyazidism.htm |title=Yazidism |first=Tore |last=Kjeilen |accessdate=2008-03-31 |work=Encyclopaedia |publisher=LookLex |quote=Malak Taus filled 7 jars of tears through 7,000 years. His tears were used to extinguish the fire in hell. Therefore, there is no hell in Yazidism.[/tpl][/tpl] Furthermore, the Yazidi story regarding Tawûsê Melek's rise to favor with God is almost identical to the story of the jinn Iblis in Islam, except that Yazidis revere Tawûsê Melek for refusing to submit to Adam, while Muslims believe that Iblis' refusal to submit caused him to fall out of Grace with God, and to later become Satan himself.Islam: Satan, sin, and repentance at Encyclopædia Britannica
Tawûsê Melek is often identified by Muslims and Christians with Shaitan (Satan). Yazidis, however, believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen angel. They are forbidden from speaking the name Shaitan. They also hold that the source of evil is in the heart and spirit of humans themselves, not in Tawûsê Melek. The active forces in their religion are Tawûsê Melek and Sheik Adî.

Cunoniaceae is a family of 26 genera and about 350 species of woody plants in the Antarctic flora, with many laurifolia species with glossy leaves endemic to laurel forest habitat. The family is native to Australia, New Caledonia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Oceania, Mexico, Central America, South America, Madagascar, the Mascarene Islands, and southern Africa. Several of the genera have remarkable disjunct ranges, found on more than one continent, e.g. Cunonia in South Africa and New Caledonia, and Caldcluvia and Eucryphia in both Australia and South America. Caldcluvia also extends north of the Equator to the Philippines, and Geissois to Fiji in the Pacific Ocean.
The greatest diversity of genera are in Australia and Tasmania (16 genera), New Guinea (9 genera), and New Caledonia (7 genera). South Africa has two genera (Cunonia and Platylophus). The Americas have four genera (Caldcluvia, Eucryphia, Lamanonia, and Weinmannia), with Weinmannia ranging from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean through tropical and temperate South America.
The family includes trees, shrubs and lianas; most are evergreen but a few are deciduous. The leaves are opposite or whorled, rarely alternate, and simple or pinnate, and often with conspicuous stipules. The flowers have four or five (rarely three or up to ten) sepals and petals. The fruit is usually a woody capsule containing several small seeds; the seeds have an oily endosperm.
The families Baueraceae, Davidsoniaceae and Eucryphiaceae, previously regarded as distinct, are now included in the Cunoniaceae.
The family has one or two fossil representatives. Platydiscus peltatus is found in Upper Cretaceous rocks from Sweden and is likely a member of the Cunoniaceae. An earlier possible fossil member is from the Albian. Tropidogyne, found in Indochinese amber, has flowers that strongly resemble the extant Ceratopetalum.

The Lancet, one of the oldest scientific medical journals in the world, published two peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate. The first was published in 2004; the second (by many of the same authors) in 2006.  The studies estimate the number of excess deaths caused by the occupation, both direct (combatants plus non-combatants) and indirect (due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc.).
The first survey[tpl]PDFlink|"Mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq:  cluster sample survey"|263 KB[/tpl]. By Les Roberts, Riyadh Lafta, Richard Garfield, Jamal Khudhairi, and Gilbert Burnham. The Lancet,  29 October 2004. There is a version of the PDF article that has a  clickable table of contents. It is here: http://www.jhsph.edu/refugee/publications_tools/iraq/sdarticle.pdf. published on 29 October 2004, estimated 98,000 excess Iraqi deaths (with a range of 8,000 to 194,000, using a 95% confidence interval (CI)) from the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq to that time, or about 50% higher than the death rate prior to the invasion. The authors described this as a conservative estimate, because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Falluja. If the Falluja cluster were included, the mortality estimate would increase to 150% over pre-invasion rates (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.2).

The new study applied similar methods and involved surveys between May 20 and July 10, 2006. More households were surveyed, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were due to violence. 31% (186,318) of those were attributed to the Coalition, 24% (144,246) to others, and 46% (276,472) unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56% or 336,575), car bomb (13% or 78,133), other explosion/ordnance (14%), air strike (13% or 78,133), accident (2% or 12,020), and unknown (2%). 
The Lancet surveys are controversial because their mortality figures are higher than most other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict."Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate" By Michael Spagat and Josh Dougherty Out of all the Iraqi casualty surveys so far, only the Lancet surveys and the Iraq Family Health Survey were peer-reviewed. The Lancet surveys have triggered criticism and disbelief from some journalists, governments, the Iraq Body Count project, some epidemiologists and statisticians and others, but have also been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.

[[Dutch roll]]
CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics

Dutch roll is a type of aircraft motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of "tail-wagging" and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of mass, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.
In aircraft design, Dutch roll results from relatively weaker positive directional stability as opposed to positive lateral stability. When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a sideslip is introduced into the relative wind in the direction of the rolling motion. Strong lateral stability begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than lateral stability for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. As such, the aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing in the direction of the original roll. At that point, the sideslip is introduced in the opposite direction and the process is reversed. 
The most common mechanism of Dutch roll occurrence is a moment of yawing motion which can be caused by any number of factors.  As a swept-wing aircraft yaws (to the right, for instance), the left wing becomes less-swept than the right wing in reference to the relative wind.  Because of this, the left wing develops more lift than the right wing causing the aircraft to roll to the right.  This motion continues until the yaw angle of the aircraft reaches the point where the vertical stabilizer effectively becomes a wind vane and reverses the yawing motion.  As the aircraft yaws back to the left, the right wing then becomes less swept than the left resulting in the right wing developing more lift than the left.  The aircraft then rolls to the left as the yaw angle again reaches the point where the aircraft wind-vanes back the other direction and the whole process repeats itself.  The average duration of a Dutch roll half-cycle is 2 to 3 seconds.
The Dutch roll mode can be excited by any use of aileron or rudder, but for flight test purposes it is usually excited with a rudder singlet (short, sharp motions of the rudder to a specified angle, and then back to the centered position) or doublet (a pair of such motions in opposite directions). Some larger aircraft are better excited with aileron inputs. Periods can range from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Dutch roll is also the name (considered by professionals to be a misnomer) given to a coordination maneuver generally taught to student pilots to help them improve their "stick-and-rudder" technique. The aircraft is alternately rolled as much as 60 degrees left and right while rudder is applied to keep the nose of the aircraft pointed at a fixed point. More correctly, this is a rudder coordination practice exercise, to teach a student pilot how to correct for the effect known as adverse aileron yaw during roll inputs.
This coordination technique is better referred to as "rolling on a heading", wherein the aircraft is rolled in such a way as to maintain an accurate heading without the nose moving from side-to-side (or yawing). The yaw motion is induced through the use of ailerons alone due to aileron drag, wherein the lifting wing (aileron down) is doing more work than the descending wing (aileron up) and therefore creates more drag, forcing the lifting wing back, yawing the aircraft toward it. This yawing effect produced by rolling motion is known as adverse yaw. This has to be countered precisely by application of rudder in the same direction as the aileron control (left stick, left rudder - right stick, right rudder). This is known as synchronised controls when done properly, and is difficult to learn and apply well. Knowing the correct amount of rudder to apply with aileron is different for each aircraft.
The origin of the name Dutch roll is uncertain. However, it is likely that this term, describing a lateral asymmetric motion of an airplane, was borrowed from a reference to similar-appearing motion in ice skating. In 1916, aeronautical engineer Jerome C. Hunsaker published the following quote:
"Dutch roll – the third element in the lateral motion an airplane is a yawing to the right and left, combined with rolling. The motion is oscillatory of period for 7 to 12 seconds, which may or may not be damped. The analogy to 'Dutch Roll' or 'Outer Edge' in ice skating is obvious."[tpl]cite journal |last=Hunsaker| first=Jerome |year=1916 | title=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of America| volume=2| page=282[/tpl]
In 1916, Dutch Roll was the term used for skating repetitively to right and left (by analogy to the motion described for the aircraft) on the outer edge of one's skates. By 1916, the term had been imported from skating to aeronautical engineering, perhaps by Hunsaker himself. 1916 was only five years after G. H. Bryan did the first mathematics of lateral motion of aircraft in 1911.[tpl]cite book |author=Bryan, G. H. |year=1911 |title=Stability in Aviation |page=123[/tpl]
The fatal crash on May 3, 2013 of a US Air Force KC-135 has been attributed to crew's inability to recover the aircraft from a "Dutch roll".http://www.amc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123403437

CATEGORIES: Coding theory

In information theory, an erasure code is a forward error correction (FEC) code for the binary erasure channel, which transforms a message of k symbols into a longer message (code word) with n symbols such that the original message can be recovered from a subset of the n symbols. The fraction r = k/n is called the code rate, the fraction k’/k, where k’ denotes the number of symbols required for recovery, is called reception efficiency.

[[Basque mythology]]
CATEGORIES: Basque mythology, Basque culture

The mythology of the ancient Basques largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques.
One main figure of this belief system was the female character of Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material it is difficult to say if this would have been the "central pair" of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass.

Joseph "Joe" Fagan (12 March 1921 – 30 June 2001) was an English footballer and manager. He played for Manchester City in the Football League First Division as a wing half and came close to gaining international honours. As his playing career came to an end, he decided to become a coach and worked at clubs in lower leagues before getting the chance to join Liverpool in 1958. 
From December 1959, he worked with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley and was highly successful in his coaching of the club's reserve team, being mainly responsible for the development of future star players like Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith. After Shankly retired in 1974, Fagan became assistant manager to Paisley and finally manager himself when Paisley retired in 1983. In his first season, Fagan achieved an unprecedented "treble" as Liverpool won the European Cup, the League Championship and the League Cup. He had decided to retire at the end of his second season but his final match in charge was the 1985 European Cup Final which was the scene of the Heysel Stadium disaster, an event that caused him great distress. 
Fagan was an uncomplicated man who believed in the simplicity of football, a devoted family man who preferred to just get on with his job and shun the limelight. He was one of the most respected figures in the game. He and his family lived in the same house not far from Anfield throughout his Liverpool career and afterwards. He died of cancer in 2001, aged eighty.

Felipe Seade (1912 – 18 January 1969) was a painter and teacher of Lebanese descent who spent most of his life in Uruguay.
Seade was born in Santiago de Chile, the elder son of a Lebanese immigrant family. Eleven years later his whole family moved to Montevideo, Uruguay.  At the age of 12 Seade began working as an assistant to the Muralist Enrique Albertazzi and the painter Guillermo Rodríguez. Under Rodríguez' influence Seade took some painting courses at the Fine Arts Circle school. He had his first show in 1925.  From 1931 well into the 1950s Seade presented work in many national and city halls.
In 1944, Seade began his parallel career as a teacher.  He first work as teacher of drawing at the Liceo de Colonia, where he managed to paint the large mural,  Alegoría al Trabajo (1936), and later as a professor of the Montevideo Fine Arts School, where he taught for 25 years.
It is impossible to understand Seade's artistic life without a reference to his political life. He wanted to paint for "the people, not for the walls of the bourgeoisie". He aspired to paint murals, the preferred way for his generation  to reach the masses, but the only murals he managed to finish were the one in Colonia and the  La marcha del Pueblo à la Piedra Alta (1939) at the Conference Hall of the Liceo de Florida. However, a significant part or Seade's work is formed by his sketches of murals and preparity sketches for murals.
Thematically, Seade mostly sought to represent the characters of Uruguayan life — washing women, Gauchos, soccer fans, kids and women. Not from a tourist perspective, which he despised, but with the passion of a convinced social realist.
Seade was also an expert draughtsman. His most public work was a long series of illustrations for a key local magazine, Mundo Uruguayo. His more private drawings were mostly sketches for paintings.
Although Seade had an active participation in Salons and through his teaching was one of the more visible artists of Uruguay in his time, he disliked and avoided the world of galleries and art critics. This is probably one reason why after his death he has remained in relative obscurity. Important critics and historians such as Gabriel Peluffo Linari, Fernando García Esteban and Atahualpa del Cioppo have recognised Seade's cultural importance.

[[Cape Ann dory]]
CATEGORIES: Boat types

The Cape Ann dory is a traditional fishing boat, a variant of the beach dory or Swampscott dory. Cape Ann dories were often fitted with a small spirit rig sail, a short folding centerboard, and washboards (bits of deck that run alongside the boat to keep the water out when heeling).  The descendants of the Cape Ann dory are still raced as the Town Class.  Due to their 'V'-shaped hulls, dories, especially those that are more slab-sided than rounded, have a tendency to heel sharply at first.
Beach dories were designed to be launched behind a breakwater (structure) and into no more than a moderate surf for a day of fishing or lobstering.  The oars were generally used to propel the boat to the fishing grounds and the afternoon wind would come up and allow the sails to be used for the return trip.
In 1876, Danish immigrant and fisherman Alfred Johnson sailed a custom twenty foot Cape Ann dory from Gloucester, Massachusetts to Liverpool in 66 days, proving the design built for fishing the rough Atlantic Ocean could handle nearly any weather.  Johnson's dory, named the "Centennial" in honor of America's 100th Anniversary, was outfitted with three watertight compartments to prevent sinking if swamped and to hold his supplies.  Instead of the simple spirit rig usually found on traditional Cape Ann dories, Johnson equipped his with a square sail and two jibs.Johnson wanted to prove he could do it alone, 28 November 2003 Johnson's dory is now located in the Cape Ann Museum.Johnson Dory

They were used as traditional fishing boats from the 1850s on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland."Chapelle, page 85 The Banks dory is a small, open, narrow, flat-bottomed and slab-sided boat with a particularly narrow transom. They were inexpensive to build and could be stacked or nested inside each other and stored on the decks of larger fishing vessels which functioned as mother ships.
Banks dories have long overhangs at the bow and stern which helps them lift over waves.  There were one-man and two-man versions. The larger ones (12 ft along the bottom or more) could be fitted with sails and a tiller. The dories became more stable in rough weather when they were loaded with about half a ton of catch.

Cerro Negro is a volcano in the Cordillera de los Maribios mountain range in Nicaragua, about 10 km from the village of Malpaisillo.  It is a very new volcano, the youngest in Central America, having first appeared in April 1850.  It consists of a gravelly basaltic cinder cone, which contrasts greatly with the surrounding verdant hillsides, and gives rise to its name, which means Black Hill. 
Cerro Negro has erupted frequently since its first eruption.[tpl]cite gvp|vnum=1404-07=&volpage=erupt|name=Cerro Negro - Eruptive History [/tpl]  One unusual aspect of several eruptions has been the emission of ash from the top of the cone, while lava erupts from fractures at the base.
Cerro Negro is a polygenetic cinder cone that is part of the Central American Volcanic Arc, which formed as a result of the Cocos plate subducting under the Caribbean plate, at a rate of 9 cm/year.  It is the largest and southernmost of four cinder cones that have formed along a NW-SE trend line in the Cordillera de los Maribios mountain range.  Despite its youth, Cerro Negro has been one of the most active volcanoes in Nicaragua, with its latest eruption occurring in 1999.  Since its birth in 1850, it has erupted approximately 23 times.

CSR Limited is a major Australian industrial company, producing building products and also has an investment in the Tomago aluminium smelter located near Newcastle, New South Wales.  It is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.  In 2012, it has approximately 3,600 employees and reported an after-tax profit of $90.7 million (pre-significant items).  The company has a diversified shareholding with predominantly Australian fund managers and retail owners.  
Founded in Sydney in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining company, the company first began refining imported raw sugar, expanding into the Melbourne market in the 1870s.  Over the next two decades, mills were established in Queensland and Fiji, which began to process domestically-grown sugar.  In 1923, the Queensland state government signed an agreement with CSR to refine all of that state's sugar production, a monopoly that was to continue until 1989.  Mills outside Queensland were sold in the 1970s.  About 80% of production is exported.
Until 2010, the refined sugar products for the retail market were produced in a joint venture with Mackay Sugar Co-Operative (75% controlled by CSR), who operate refineries in Mackay (Queensland), and Melbourne.  The CSR brand is used on most of the retail sugar products produced.  The production makes up around 60% of the sugar on the Australian domestic market, and 80% of that in New Zealand.  Using the molasses by-product from the sugar mills, the company also distills ethanol for use in fuel ethanol manufacture, and varying grades of domestic industrial ethanols for food production and other chemical processes.
The company began to diversify into building products as early as 1942, with the construction of a plaster mill in Sydney, and in 1947 the company began manufacturing plasterboard there, bringing the product to the Australian market.  It acquired Bradford Insulation in 1959, which produced heat insulation materials for buildings, and currently has a substantial share of the insulation market in Australia.   It has established insulation businesses in China, Thailand and Malaysia, originally in joint ventures with local partners, but now wholly owned.  The company also produces fibre cement sheeting, aerated concrete products, bricks, and systems to support plasterboard construction through Rondo, a joint venture with Boral.  It spun off its interests in heavy building products, then producing more than half the group's profits, to a separate listed company, Rinker Group, in 2003.  In 2007, CSR acquired the Australasian glass businesses of Pilkington and the Melbourne based glass processing company DMS Glass, subsequently renaming both as Viridian.
The company's interest in aluminium is through an approximate 25% stake in the Tomago aluminium smelter near Newcastle, New South Wales.
The current managing director is Rob Sindel, a CSR employee since 2009, and the chairman of the board of directors is  Jeremy Sutcliffe, the former managing director of Sims Metal.  The group's corporate headquarters is in North Ryde 3 Building, a suburb of Sydney. 
In December 2010, CSR sold its sugar and ethanol business, Sucrogen, to the Singaporean company Wilmar

[[Geometric quantization]]

CATEGORIES: Symplectic geometry, Mathematical quantization, Functional analysis

In mathematical physics, geometric quantization is a mathematical approach to defining a quantum theory corresponding to a given classical theory. It attempts to carry out quantization, for which there is in general no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest. For example, the similarity between the Heisenberg equation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and the Hamilton equation in classical physics should be built in. 
One of the earliest attempts at a natural quantization was Weyl quantization, proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1927. Here, an attempt is made to associate a quantum-mechanical observable (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space) with a real-valued function on classical phase space. The position and momentum in this phase space are mapped to the generators of the Heisenberg group, and the Hilbert space appears as a group representation of the Heisenberg group.  In 1946, [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold |
H. J.  Groenewold]] (H.J. Groenewold, "On the Principles of elementary quantum mechanics", Physica,12 (1946) pp. 405-460)  considered the product of a pair of such observables and asked what the corresponding function would be on the classical phase space. This led him to discover the phase-space star-product of a pair of functions.  
More generally, this technique leads to deformation quantization, where the  ★-product is taken to be a deformation of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold or Poisson manifold. However, as a natural  quantization scheme (a functor), Weyl's map is not satisfactory. For example, the Weyl map of the classical angular-momentum-squared  is not just the quantum angular momentum squared operator, but it further contains a constant term 3ħ2/2. (This extra term is actually physically significant, since it accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom, cf. [tpl]cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.65.022109|noedit[/tpl]). As a mere representation change, however, Weyl's map underlies the alternate Phase space formulation of conventional quantum mechanics.  
The geometric quantization procedure falls into the following three steps: prequantization, polarization, and metaplectic correction. Prequantization produces a natural Hilbert space together with a quantization procedure for observables that exactly preserves transforms Poisson brackets on the classical side into commutators on the quantum side. Nevertheless, the prequantum Hilbert space is generally understood to be "too big"; see the discussion in Section 22.3 of Hall (2013). The idea is that one should then select a Poisson-commuting set of n variables on the 2n-dimensional phase space and consider functions (or, more properly, sections) that depend only on these n variables. The n variables can be either real-valued, resulting in a position-style Hilbert space, or complex-valued, producing something like the Segal–Bargmann space. A polarization is just a coordinate-independent description of such a choice of n Poisson-commuting functions; see Section 23.4 of Hall (2013). The metaplectic correction (also known as the half-form correction) is a technical modification of the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations and often convenient for complex polarizations.
Geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds and symplectic foliations also is developed. For instance, this is the case of partially integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems and non-autonomous mechanics.

Alexander Francis Chamberlain (1865 – 1914) was a Canadian anthropologist, born in England. Under the direction of Franz Boas he received the first Ph.D. granted in anthropology in the United States from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. After graduating, he taught at Clark, eventually becoming full professor in 1911.  Under the auspices of the British Association, his area of specialty was the Kootenay (British Columbia) Indians. 
He was well known in anthropology for his bibliographic work, compiling the lists of new books and articles that appeared in the early issues of the American Anthropologist and later the Journal of American Folklore.  He was editor of the Journal of American Folklore between 1901-1908.  His works include:
He also contributed to the second edition of the New International Encyclopedia on South American Indians and Asiatic peoples, and to 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica on North American Indians.
Boas's obituary for him (one of a number he had to write for younger colleagues including Pliny Earle Goddard and Edward Sapir) recalls him as a genuinely good person.
The generosity with which he gave of his knowledge and his time to his fellow-workers was merely an expression of the desire to be of service to mankind, which was a dominant trait in his character

Loyalists were American colonists who remained loyal to the British Empire and the British monarchy during the American Revolutionary War. At the time they were often called Tories, Royalists, or King's Men. They were opposed by the Patriots, those who supported the revolution. When their cause was defeated, about 15% of the Loyalists or 65-70,000 fled to other parts of the British Empire, in Britain or elsewhere in British North America. The southern colonists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, while northern colonists largely migrated to Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where they were called United Empire Loyalists. Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.The Americans promised in the peace treaty to recommend that states redress the Loyalists' financial losses, but that seldom happened. Exiled loyalists received ₤3 million or about 37% of their losses from the British government. Some Loyalists who stayed in the U.S. were able to retain their property. Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds, A Companion to the American Revolution (2004) pp. 246, 399, 641–2
Historians have estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of the 2.5 million whites in the colonies were Loyalists, or about 500,000 men,  women and children.Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality," p. 235; Middlekauff (2005) pp. 563–564; Thomas B.

[[Kac–Moody algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Lie algebras

In mathematics, a Kac–Moody algebra (named for Victor Kac and Robert Moody, who independently discovered them) is a Lie algebra, usually infinite-dimensional, that can be defined by generators and relations through a generalized Cartan matrix. These algebras form a generalization of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, and many properties related to the structure of a Lie algebra such as its root system, irreducible representations, and connection to flag manifolds have natural analogues in the Kac–Moody setting.
A class of Kac–Moody algebras called affine Lie algebras is of particular importance in mathematics and theoretical physics, especially conformal field theory and the theory of exactly solvable models. Kac discovered an elegant proof of certain combinatorial identities, the Macdonald identities, which is based on the representation theory of affine Kac–Moody algebras. Howard Garland and James Lepowsky demonstrated that Rogers–Ramanujan identities can be derived in a similar fashion.(?)

The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF) was a small volunteer force of approximately 2,000 men, raised in Australia shortly after the outbreak of the First World War to seize and destroy German wireless stations in German New Guinea in the south-west Pacific. Britain required the German wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee's German East Asian Cruiser Squadron, which threatened merchant shipping in the region.  Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. New Zealand provided a similar force for the occupation of German Samoa.

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Nicaragua, Volcanoes of Nicaragua, Stratovolcanoes, Crater lakes, Rivas Department

With a height of 1,394 m, Maderas is the smaller of the two volcanoes which make up the island of Ometepe, situated in Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua, Central America.  Unlike Concepción, the other volcano on the island, Maderas has not been active in historical times. Its crater contains a crater lake.
The slopes of Maderas are one of the few places on the Pacific side of Nicaragua where cloud forest grows. The only other place where this is found is at the Mombacho volcano. Cloud forests are characterized by a rich plant and animal life, made possible by the high levels of humidity in the climate. Prehistoric petroglyphs have been found at the Maderas volcano. 
Climbing to the top of the volcano is a popular tourist activity. Currently, tourists must hire a guide to climb to the top, as several tourists have gotten lost in the past. The hike to the top of the crater can be difficult, with steep inclines that get muddy when it rains. It rains often on Ometepe Island, so a slippery climb is likely, even in the dry season. The return walk takes between 6 and 9 hours.
There are a number of interesting species that dwell on the volcano, including the white-faced monkey, mountain crab, howler monkeys, and a number of butterflies including the well-known blue morphos.

Masaya is a caldera located 20 km south of Managua, Nicaragua. It is Nicaragua's first and largest National Park, and one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. The complex volcano is composed of a nested set of calderas and craters, the largest of which is Las Sierras shield volcano and caldera. Within this caldera lies a sub-vent, which is Masaya Volcano sensu stricto. The vent is a shield type composing of basaltic lavas and tephras and includes a summit crater. This hosts Masaya caldera, formed 2500 years ago by an 8-km³ basaltic ignimbrite eruption. Inside this caldera a new basaltic complex has grown from eruptions mainly on a semi-circular set of vents that include the Masaya and Nindiri cones. The latter host the pit craters of Masaya, Santiago, Nindiri and San Pedro. Observations in the walls of the pit craters indicate that there have been several episodes of cone and pit crater formation.
The floor of Masaya caldera is mainly covered by poorly vegetated ʻaʻā lava, indicating resurfacing within the past 1000 or so years, but only two lava flows have erupted since the sixteenth century. The first, in 1670, was an overflow from the Nindiri crater, which at that time hosted a 1-km-wide lava lake. The other, in 1772, issued from a fissure on the flank of the Masaya cone. Since 1772, lava has appeared at the surface only in the Santiago pit crater (presently active and persistently degassing) and possibly within Nindiri crater in 1852. A lake occupies the far eastern end of the caldera.
Masaya continually emits large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas (from the active Santiago crater) and volcanologists study this (amongst other signs) to better understand the behavior of the volcano and also evaluate the impact of acid rain and the potential for health problems. 
Although the recent activity of Masaya has largely been dominated by continuous degassing from an occasionally lava-filled pit crater, a number of discrete explosive events have occurred in the last 50 years. One such event occurred on November 22, 1999, which was recognised from satellite data. A hot spot appeared on satellite imagery, and there was a possible explosion. On April 23, 2001 the crater exploded and formed a new vent in the bottom of the crater. The explosion sent rocks with diameters up to 60 cm which travelled up to 500 m from the crater. Vehicles in the visitors area were damaged and one person was injured. On October 4, 2003 an eruption cloud was reported at Masaya. The plume rose to a height of ~4.6 km. In 2008, the mountain erupted spewing ash and steam.
The Masaya Volcano is located in the department of Masaya.

Mombacho is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, near the city of Granada. It is 1344 metres high. The Mombacho Volcano Nature Reserve is one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. Mombacho is an extinct volcano but the last eruption occurred in 1570. There is no historical knowledge of earlier eruptions.
The highest regions of the volcano is home to a cloud forest and dwarf forest, which contains flora and fauna that are endemic purely to the volcano. An increasingly popular tourist attraction, the volcano has fantastic views of Lake Nicaragua and the city of Granada. The volcano also has two hiking trails, a moderate one that circles the main crater, and another more difficult trail (El Puma), which must be led by a guide.  The more difficult trail is the only way to see some features such as the dwarf forest.  The trail is almost completely 45 degree inclines and declines for about two miles.  
There are more than 700 different plants registered around Mombacho. Included are many species of orchids.

Momotombo is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, not far from the city of León.  It stands on the shores of Lago de Managua.  An eruption of the volcano in 1610 forced inhabitants of the Spanish city of León to relocate about 30 miles west.  The ruins of this city are preserved at León Viejo (Old León).
The mountain is very symmetrical, and its form is a symbol of Nicaragua, cropping up in locations from matchboxes to revolutionary murals.  This volcano was also very popular before World War I began.  A lot of tourists came by, most popular in 1904, 1 year before the eruption.  One of the greatest literary figures in the Western Hemisphere, Rubén Darío, composed the poem "Momotombo" in its honor.
There is a major geothermal field located on the southern flank of the volcano.  To climb the mountain, with a permit cross through the geothermal power plant and follow an easily marked trail through the treeline.  Due to the active nature of the volcano and landslides, the route from the treeline to the top is constantly changing.  The quickest way is straight up, through the small avalanche paths.

[[Perfusionist]]
CATEGORIES: Healthcare occupations

A perfusionist, also known as a clinical perfusionist or a cardiovascular perfusionist, is a specialized healthcare professional who uses the heart-lung machine during cardiac surgery and other surgeries that require cardiopulmonary bypass to manage the patient's physiological status.  
The perfusionist is a highly trained member of the cardiothoracic surgical team which consists of cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists, physician assistants, surgical technologists, and nurses. The perfusionist's main responsibility is to manage the physiological and metabolic needs of the cardiac surgical patient so that the cardiac surgeon may operate on a still, unbeating heart. This is accomplished through the utilization of the heart-lung machine, as well as its associated components of an oxygenator, filters, reservoirs and tubing. The perfusionist is responsible for the management of circulatory and respiratory  functions of the patient which has a great effect on the patient systemic condition and  allows the cardiac surgeon to focus on the actual surgical procedure and less on the immediate needs of the patient. Other responsibilities include autologous blood collection and processing, implementation and management of the intra-aortic balloon pump, adult and infant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as well as monitoring of anticoagulation, electrolyte, acid-base balance and blood-gas composition. In many tertiary hospitals, perfusionists are also key personnel in placing and managing patients on ventricular assist devices as bridge to recovery or heart transplantation and supporting patients receiving lung or liver transplants. In some hospitals, perfusionists can be involved in procurement of cardiothoracic donor organs for transplantation.

His younger brother, Abdelaziz of Morocco, preceded him. While Mulai Abdelhafid initially opposed his brother for giving some concessions to foreign powers, he himself became increasingly backed by the French and finally signed the protectorate treaty giving de facto control of the country to France.
After his brother, Abdelaziz appointed him as caliph of Marrakech, Abdelhafid sought to have him overthrown by fomenting distrust over Abdelaziz's European ties. He was aided by Madani al-Glaoui, older brother of T'hami one of the Caids of the Atlas. He was assisted in the training of his troops by Andrew Belton (Kaid), a British officer and veteran of the Second Boer War.New York Times, November 4, 1908 For a brief period Abdelaziz reigned from Rabat while Abdelhafid reigned in Marrakech and Fes was disputed. In 1908 Abdelaziz was defeated in battle. In 1909, he became the recognized leader of Morocco.

[tpl]About|the glacial feature||Icecap (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Icecap[/tpl]
An  ice cap is an ice mass that covers less than 50 000 km² of land area (usually covering a highland area). Masses of ice covering more than 50 000 km² are termed an ice sheet.[ref]
</ref><ref name=Bennett>
[/ref][ref]
</ref>
Ice caps are not constrained by topographical features (i.e., they will lie over the top of mountains). By contrast, ice masses of similar size that are constrained by topographical features are known as ice fields. The dome of an ice cap is usually centred on the highest point of a massif. Ice flows away from this high point (the ice divide) towards the ice cap's periphery. 
Ice caps have significant effects on the geomorphology of the area they occupy. Plastic moulding, gouging and other glacial erosional features become present upon the glacier's retreat. Many lakes, such as the Great Lakes in North America, as well as numerous valleys have been formed by glacial action over hundreds of thousands of years.
On Earth, there are about 30 million km³ of total ice mass.  The average temperature of an ice mass ranges between -20°C and -30°C. The core of an ice cap exhibits a constant temperature that ranges between -15°C and -20°C.
A high-latitude region covered in ice, though strictly not an ice cap (since they exceed the maximum area specified in the definition above), are called polar ice caps; the usage of this designation is widespread in the mass media and arguably recognized by experts.The National Snow and Ice Data Center Glossary
Vatnajökull is an example of an ice cap in Iceland.

[[Gloucester dory]]

CATEGORIES: Boat types, Gloucester, Massachusetts

The Gloucester dory is a variant of the Banks dory, a type of narrow-bottomed, slab-sided boat, common in the North Eastern United States.  It is characteristically smaller and lighter, with less overhang, both bow and stern, and less freeboard.  It retains the Banks dory's slab sides.  Gloucester dories were designed to be launched through the surf behind a breakwater for daily fishing and lobstering off the Massachusetts shore.  
Because of its simple lines, a Gloucester dory is relatively easy to build.  With the straight sides and flat bottom, stitch and glue techniques work well with this boat.

[[Over Time Limit]]
CATEGORIES: Rally racing terminology, Road rallying

In car rallying, Over Time Limit (universally abbreviated as OTL) is a situation where a crew has fallen so far behind their scheduled time that, in most rallies, they are excluded from further competition.
The purpose of OTL is to set a limit on crews so that marshals and other personnel involved in running a rally only need to wait a fixed amount of time after the last car was due before closing the control. Without OTL it could be very difficult to run a rally smoothly without having huge numbers of volunteers willing to wait around indefinitely.
For crews in a stage rally, OTL is a fixed limit of accrued lateness, after which one is no longer allowed to continue to compete. Lateness itself is not necessarily the result of a lack of competitiveness - for example a 10-minute roadside repair on a non-competitive section would not count against that crew's recorded stage times, etc., but it would count towards lateness. Many rallies feature special controls and breaks which allow any accrued lateness to be reset.  In certain rallies (mainly road and navigational) it is also possible to make back lateness during the normal course of the event, subject to certain restrictions.  Also any lateness incurred due to a decision of the organisers or force majure (i.e. an alteration of the route or hold-up) is not counted against the total lateness.
In a navigational rally or road rally then any crew which turns up at a time control OTL is deemed not to have visited it at all and penalised accordingly: either excluded if the control is a main time control; or typically 30 minutes or 1 fail for other controls.
The official expansion of the term OTL is "Over Total Lateness", although in everyday use only "Over Time Limit" is generally used.
In Australian rallying, the term "Out of Late Time" (OLT) is used.  Whilst not a term used in the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport's Manual of Motor Sport (neither is Over Time Limit), it is a term used commonly on Australian rallying websites in event reports and also in event results.

While pockets of settlements had taken place in the region with archaeological findings dating back thousands of years, regular written records were not made until the engagement of Imperial China and the British Colony in the territory. Starting out as a fishing village, salt production site and trading ground, it later evolved into a military port of strategic importance and eventually an international financial centre that has the world's 6th highest GDP (PPP) per capita, supporting 33% of the foreign capital flows into China.CIA gov.

The Hully Gully is a type of unstructured line dance often considered to have originated in the sixties, but is also mentioned some forty years earlier as a dance common in the black juke joints in the first part of the twentieth century.  In its modern form it consisted of a series of "steps" that are called out by the MC. Each step was relatively simple and easy to execute; however, the challenge was to keep up with the speed of each step.
The phrase "Hully Gully" or "Hull da Gull" comes from a folk game in which a player shakes a handful of nuts or seeds and asks his opponent "Hully Gully, how many?"name=folkgames>

[[Protonium]]
CATEGORIES: Exotic atoms, Onium

Protonium is an exotic atom in which a proton and an antiproton orbit each other. Protonium is an electrically neutral boson with zero baryon number.
There are two known methods to generate protonium. One method involves violent particle collisions. The other method involves putting antiprotons and protons into the same magnetic cage. The latter method was first used during the experiment ATHENA (ApparaTus for High precision Experiment on Neutral Antimatter) by Evandro Lodi Rizzini's working group at the CERN laboratory in Geneva in 2002, but it was not until 2006 that scientists realized protonium was also generated during the experiment.
Reactions involving a proton and an antiproton at high energies give rise to many-particle final states. In fact, such reactions are the basis of particle colliders such as the Tevatron at Fermilab. Indirect searches for protonium at LEAR (Low Energy Antiproton Ring at CERN) have used antiprotons impinging on nuclei such as helium, with unclear results. Very low energy collisions in the range of 10 eV to 1 keV may lead to the formation of protonium.
Planned experiments will use traps as the source of low energy antiprotons. Such a beam would be allowed to impinge on atomic hydrogen targets, in the field of a laser, which is meant to excite the bound proton-antiproton pairs into an excited state of protonium with some efficiency (whose computation is an open theoretical problem). Unbound particles are rejected by bending them in a magnetic field. Since the protonium is uncharged, it will not be deflected by such a field. This undeflected protonium, if formed, would be allowed to traverse a meter of high vacuum, within which it is expected to decay via annihilation of the proton and antiproton. The decay products would give unmistakable signatures of the formation of protonium.
Theoretical studies of protonium have mainly used non-relativistic quantum mechanics. These give predictions for the binding energy and lifetime of the states. Computed lifetimes are in the range of 0.1 to 10 microseconds. Unlike the hydrogen atom in which the dominant interactions are due to the Coulomb attraction of the electron and the proton, the constituents of protonium interact predominantly through the strong interaction. Thus multiparticle interactions involving mesons in intermediate states may be important. Hence the production and study of protonium would be of interest also for the understanding of internucleon forces.

[[Jersey Skiff]]

CATEGORIES: Dinghies

The Jersey Skiff is a beach launched boat first appearing around the end of the 19th century. They were first used as fishing boats, to be launched through the surf, sailed to the fishing grounds and then retrieved through the surf.
There were two distinct versions, along the Northern Jersey Shore, The Sea Bright, and the Southern Shore, Jersey Skiff.  In the early 20th century Jersey Skiffs were employed by early coast guardsmen and lifeguards. The boats had evolved into wreckage and salvage work as well as fishing uses. The primary difference between the two boats is the addition of a board on the side of the Jersey Skiff for slightly greater freeboard. Also the hull is slightly narrower for better rowing. And the transom of Jersey Skiff is more of a wine glass shape which integrates into the skeg, whereas The Sea Bright transom does not. The skeg can be added as an additional board.
The design characteristics of the boat, are a stem that is slightly raked, less than a Dory and more than a Whitehall Rowboat. The stern was in a heart or wine glass shape with a rake toward the center of the boat. This allows the boat to be retrieved through the surf bow first. Although it is reported that in rougher conditions the boat is beached stern first. The boats are of fairly shallow draft and have a narrow flat bottom which is useful for sitting on the beach. Although the sides are generally rounded, without a keel but with a small skeg for tracking.
The boats were generally outfitted with a sprit or lug sailing rig and a small jib. The mast was generally unstayed. Early fisherman used an oar to steer with rather than bring a separate rudder. Modern sailing versions come with a separate rudder. But an oarlock can be mounted on the transom for use with an oar as a steering device.

[[Whitehall Rowboat]]
CATEGORIES: Boat types

Whitehall Rowboats are considered one of the most refined rowboats of the 19th century.[tpl]cn|date=February 2012[/tpl] The basic design is much older and of European ancestry. It strongly resembles a sailing ship's gig or a Thames river wherry used by watermen as a taxi service. They were first made in the U.S. at the foot of Whitehall Street in New York City to be used to ferry goods, services, and sailors on and off the boats coming into New York Harbor. The boats range from 14 to 22 ft in length, the larger requiring two people to row them. A Whitehall Gig, which is the slightly longer version is 25 ft in length, requiring four rowers and a Coxswain for a crew of 5. 
They were the first boats to incorporate an inverted-hull frame set up to speed up the manufacturing process.
The hull shape is characterized by a nearly straight stem, and slight flare to the bow, rounded sides, with a keel running the entire length of the bottom and a distinctive wine glass transom with a full skeg. Considered one of the most beautiful row-boats, they are designed to handle the harbor chop and yet track straight. Speed was the issue with these boats, as the first to the ship with the goods generally received the lion's share of the sales. Later the shore patrol used these boats for customs, police issues, water taxi, and newspaper reporting.
Whitehalls in the early 20th century were a popular recreational boat and were known as the "Bicycle of the sea". A beginning rower finds it easier to row this design in a straight line because of the tracking type keel. Turning requires stronger strokes on one side, and by braking with one oar and pulling with the other the boat can be turned in its own length.
Whitehall designs are currently being built in wood, and also manufactured fiberglass usually with wood trims, and more recently thermoformed in co-polymer plastic. These boats are either traditional fixed seat row boats or slide seat rowing boats. Some models or also including sailing rigs. Many designs are mistakenly being called Whitehalls when they are not actually true to the design criteria. The Mystic Seaport Maritime Museum has a comprehensive collection of authentic Whitehall Lines.

Morpeth Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. Built between 1844 and 1847, it also included a smaller branch dock to the east. It is named after Lord Morpeth, the 7th Earl of Carlisle, who was the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests.
Originally, the dock connected directly to the River Mersey via locks, although the entrance channel has since been partially infilled and the locks removed after being disused for some years. Access to the Great Float via Egerton Dock has also been removed, making both docks effectively landlocked.[tpl]citation|title=Birkenhead Docks|first=Ian|last=Collard|publisher=Tempus Publishing|date=2007|page=73|isbn=978-0-7524-4259-4[/tpl]
Morpeth Dock was used by GWR as the Birkenhead end of cross-river traffic to the Manchester Dock.
Part of the dock and its former branch were filled in to provide a site for a water treatment plant.

Perl 6 is a member of the Perl family of programming languages.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.perl.org/about.html | title = About Perl | accessdate = 2013-04-20 | publisher = perl.org | quote = "Perl" is a family of languages, "Perl 6" is part of the family, but it is a separate language which has its own development team. Its existence has no significant impact on the continuing development of "Perl 5".[/tpl] It is still in development as a specification from which several interpreter and compiler implementations are being written. It is introducing elements of many modern and historical languages. Perl 6 is intended to have many implementations. Compatibility with Perl 5 is not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Perl 6 began in 2000.
Development on Pugs, the first high-traction implementation, began in 2005, and today there are multiple Perl 6 implementation projects. Rakudo Perl is based on Parrot and NQP (Not Quite Perl), and releases a new version every month; in July 2010, the project released the first Rakudo Star distribution, a useful and usable collection of a Perl 6 implementation and related materials.  Larry Wall maintains a reference grammar known as STD.pm6, written in Perl 6 and bootstrapped with Perl 5.
Niecza, another major Perl 6 implementation, focuses on optimization and efficient implementation research. It targets the Common Language Infrastructure.

[[Peninsulars]]
CATEGORIES: Ethnic groups in the Americas, Ethnic groups in Latin America, Latin American caste system, Spanish colonization of the Americas

In the colonial caste system of Spanish America and Spanish Philippines, a peninsular ([tpl]IPA-es|peninsuˈlar[/tpl], pl. peninsulares)  was a Spanish-born Spaniard or mainland Spaniard residing in the New World or the Spanish East Indies, as opposed to a person of full Spanish descent born in the Americas or Philippines, who were known as creoles. The word "peninsular" makes reference to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, where Spain is located. 
Higher offices in the Americas and Philippines were held by peninsulares. Apart from the distinction of peninsulares from criollos, the castas system distinguished also mestizos (of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry in the Americas, and mixed Spanish and Chinese or native Filipino in the Philippines), mulatos (of mixed Spanish and black ancestry), indios, zambos (mixed Amerindian and black ancestry) and finally blacks. In some places and times, such as during the wars of independence, peninsulares were called deprecatively godos (for the "Visigoths", who had ruled Spain), or in Mexico, gachupines or gauchos.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
Colonial officials at the highest levels arrived from Spain to fulfill their duty to govern Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. Often, the peninsulares possessed large quantities of land. They defended Cádiz's monopoly on trade, upsetting the criollos, who turned to contraband with British and French colonies, especially in areas away from the main ports of call for the Flota de Indias. They worked to preserve Spanish power and acted as agents of patrol, in certain cases.
In colonial social hierarchy, the peninsulares were nominally at the top, followed by criollos, who developed a fully entrenched powerful local aristocracy during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. In the French Revolution, the peninsulares were generally conservative.

[[National Transport Workers' Federation]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom, 1910 establishments in the United Kingdom

The National Transport Workers' Federation was an association of British trade unions. It was formed in 1910 to co-ordinate the activities of various organisations catering for dockers, seamen, tramwaymen and road transport workers. Its affiliates included:
The NTWF laid the foundations for the creation of the Transport and General Workers Union in 1922, though it continued to exist after that date. It had some success as an organisational tool and as a symbol of trade union unity, but since its member unions retained full control over their own affairs it was not always able to have a direct influence on trade disputes. In 1912, it called a National Dock Strike in support of London dockers which was observed only in a few centres, and which ended within a week. This was regarded as an embarrassing setback, and led the Federation to adopt a more cautious approach in subsequent years. In 1921 it was criticised for failing to bring out its members in support of the miners in the Black Friday crisis.

[[History of Jewish education in the United States before the 20th century]]
CATEGORIES: Jewish-American history, 18th century in the United States, 19th century in the United States, History of education in the United States

The history of Jewish education in the United States before the 20th century is as old as the United States itself; it's a part of overall U.S. Jewish history.
That history begins early in the history of the first Jewish congregation in New York.  Attached to that congregation was a school in which secular as well as Hebrew branches were taught. It was one of the earliest general schools in America; poor children received tuition-free instruction. 
Religious instruction was established in connection with most of the early synagogues. For ordinary secular education American Jews resorted, in large measure, to the nonsectarian schools and colleges.  There was a Jewish matriculate at the University of Pennsylvania, for instance, as early as 1772. The older communities, however, before the general establishment of the public-school system, frequently provided regular instruction in the secular branches. These schools ordinarily were adjuncts of the religious schools maintained by the congregations. 
In Philadelphia as early as 1838 a general Sunday-school, quite irrespective of congregational organization, was established, largely through the instrumentality of Rebecca Gratz, who was its superintendent and president until 1864. This was the beginning of a movement, which has spread throughout the country, for the organization of educational work along lines quite independent of congregational activities.
