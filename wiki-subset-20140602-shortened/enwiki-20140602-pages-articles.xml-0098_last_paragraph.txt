The Slaughter-House Cases, [tpl]ussc|83|36|1873[/tpl] were the first United States Supreme Court interpretation of the relatively new Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It is viewed as a pivotal case in early civil rights law, reading the Fourteenth Amendment as protecting the "privileges or immunities" conferred by virtue of the federal United States citizenship to all individuals of all states within it, but not those privileges or immunities incident to citizenship of a state.
Properly known as Slaughter-House Cases, the decision consolidated three similar cases:

Proailurus was a compact and small animal, just a little larger than the domestic cat, weighing about  20 lb (9 kg). It had a long tail, large eyes and sharp claws and teeth, with similar proportions to the modern viverrids.  Its claws would have been retractable to some extent.  Like the viverrids, Proailurus was at least partially arboreal.[tpl]cite book |last=Turner |first=Alan |year=1997 |title= The Big Cats and their fossil relatives|publisher= Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages= 25|isbn= 0-231-10228-3[/tpl]
Proailurus, a likely ancestor of Pseudaelurus which lived 20-10 million years ago, probably gave rise to the major felid lines, including the extinct machairodontines and the extant felines and pantherines, although the phylogeny of the cats is still not precisely known.[tpl]cite journal | last = Christiansen | first = Per | title = Phylogeny of the great cats (Felidae: Pantherinae), and the influence of fossil taxa and missing characters | journal = Cladistics | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00226.x | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 977 [/tpl]

Pseudaelurus is a prehistoric cat that lived in Europe, Asia and North America in the Miocene between approximately 20 and 8 million years ago. It is an ancestor of today's felines and pantherines as well as the extinct machairodont saber-tooths, and is a successor to Proailurus. It originated from Eurasia and was the first felid to reach North America, when it entered the continent at about 18.5 Ma ending a 'cat-gap' of 7 million years.Tedford et al. 1987Rothwell 2003 The slender proportions of the animal, together with its short, viverrid-like legs, suggest that it may have been an agile climber of trees.Turner 1997

Martinus Willem Beijerinck (March 16, 1851 – January 1, 1931) was a Dutch microbiologist and botanist.
Born in Amsterdam, Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden in 1877.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Chung |first1 = K. T. |last2 = Ferris |first2 = D.

At the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University) and later at the Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Polytechnic, currently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.
He is considered one of the founders of virology.[tpl]cite journal |last1 = Lustig |first1 = Alice |last2 = Levine |first2 = Arnold J. | title = One Hundred Years of Virology | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 66 | issue = 8 | pages = 4629–-4631 | year = 1992 |publisher= American Society for Microbiology |location = Washington, D.C.| issn = 1098-5514| pmc=241285 | pmid=1629947[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1 = Bos| first1 = L. | year = 1995 | title = The Embryonic Beginning of Virology: Unbiased Thinking and Dogmatic Stagnation | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 140 | pages = 613–-619 | issn = 03048608 | doi=10.1007/bf01718437[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Zaitlin| first = Milton | editor1-last = Kung| editor1-first = S.

Beijerinck, nevertheless, set the stage for twentieth-century virologists to uncover the secrets of viral pathogens now known to cause a wide range of plant and animal (including human) diseases[/tpl] In 1898, he published results on the filtration experiments demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium.[tpl]cite journal | last = Beijerinck | first = M.

(1942) Phytopathological classics (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27–-30. Like Ivanovsky before him and Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent, however he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen virus to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it "contagium vivum fluidum" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) obtained by Wendell Stanley in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.
Beijerinck also discovered nitrogen fixation,Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, Über oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt für Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7, pp. 561-582 the process by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside root nodules of certain plants (legumes). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to soil fertility and agriculture, Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of symbiosis between plants and bacteria.
Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. Spirillum desulfuricans, the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.
Beijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking.[tpl]cite journal |author=de Wit R, Bouvier T. |title=Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects’; what did Baas Becking and Beijerinck really say? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=755–758 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118567377/PDFSTART |accessdate=2008-09-16 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01017.x |pmid=16584487[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| last=Bass-Becking |first=Lourens G.M.|year=1934 |location=The Hague| publisher=W.P.

Beijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his ascetic lifestyle and his view of science and marriage being incompatible. His low popularity with his students periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom.

Machairodus was a genus of large machairodontine saber-toothed cats that lived in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America during the late Miocene. The fossil species assigned to the genus Machairodus were divided by Turner into two grades of evolutionary development - M. aphanistus and the North American "Nimravides" catacopis representing the more primitive grade, and M. coloradensis and M. giganteus representing the more derived grade.[ref]
</ref> The characteristics of the more advanced grade include a relative elongation of the forearm and a shortening of the lumbar region of the spine to resemble that in living pantherine cats.<ref name = "Turner"/> These trends would be taken further in ''Homotherium'', which is thought to have evolved from ''Machairodus''.

The cheese is white, tangy, crumbly and slightly moist, with distinctive veins of green mold. It has characteristic odor and flavor with a notable taste of butyric acid; the green veins provide a sharp tang. The overall flavor sensation begins slightly mild, then waxes sweet, then smoky, and fades to a salty finish. It has no rind; the exterior is edible and slightly salty. A typical wheel of Roquefort weighs between 2.5 and 3 kilograms (5.5 and 6.6 pounds), and is about 10 cm (4 inches) thick. Each kilogram of finished cheese requires about 4.5 liters (1.18 gallons) of milk to produce.

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Smilodon [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|m|aɪ|l|ə|d|ɒ|n[/tpl], is an extinct genus of machairodont felid. It is perhaps the best known saber-toothed cat  and lived in North America during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5  mya–10,000 years ago). Several fossils have been found with one of the largest collections taken from the La Brea Tar Pits. Three species of the genus are known and they vary in size and build.
Overall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any modern cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canines. Its jaw had a bigger gape than modern cats and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. These attributes made Smilodon a specialized hunter of large herbivores like bison and camels.
Smilodon likely lived in closed habitats like forests and bush which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Its reliance on large animals may have been the cause of its extinction. Scientists debate over whether Smilodon was a social animal. Comparison of predator responses to distress calls and the prevalence of healed injuries suggest it was social, while its small brain size and vegetated habitat suggest it was more solitary. Some fossils show signs of ankylosing spondylitis, trauma and arthritis. Smilodon went extinct 10,000 years ago.

Prenatal care (also known as antenatal care) refers to the regular medical and nursing care recommended for women during pregnancy. Prenatal care is a type of preventative care with the goal of providing regular check-ups that allow doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy while promoting healthy lifestyles that benefit both mother and child.http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/prenatal-care.cfm. Retrieved on 11 March 2012http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/prenatal+care. Retrieved on 11 March 2012. During check-ups, women will receive medical information over maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins. Recommendations on management and healthy lifestyle changes are also made during regular check-ups. The availability of routine prenatal care has played a part in reducing maternal death rates and miscarriages as well as birth defects, low birth weight, and other preventable health problems.

Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, commonly referred to simply as Vegetius, was a writer of the Later Roman Empire. Nothing is known of his life or station beyond what he tells us in his two surviving works: Epitoma rei militaris (also referred to as De Re Militari), and the lesser-known Digesta Artis Mulomedicinae, a guide to veterinary medicine.
The latest event alluded to in his Epitoma rei militaris is the death of the Emperor Gratian (383); the earliest attestation of this work is a subscriptio by one Flavius Eutropius, writing in Constantinople in the year 450, which appears in one of two families of manuscripts, suggesting that a bifurcation of the manuscript tradition had already occurred. Despite Eutropius' location in Constantinople, the scholarly consensus is that Vegetius wrote in the Western Empire. Vegetius dedicates his work to the reigning emperor, who is identified as Theodosius, ad Theodosium imperatorem, in the manuscript family that was not edited in 450; the identity is disputed: some scholars identify him with Theodosius the Great,N.P. Milner sets forth the argument for Theodosius in Vegetius: Epitome of Military Science, second edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1996), pp. xxxvii ff; T. D. Barnes, "The Date of Vegetius" Phoenix 33.3 (Autumn 1979), pp. 254-257, makes the case for Theodosius. while others follow Otto SeeckSeeck, "Die Zeit des Vegetius", Hermes 11 (1876), 61-83. Seeck's conclusions changed the mind of Karl Lang, who twice edited the Teubner De re militaria, and adopted Seeck's ascription. and identify him with the later Valentinian III, dating the work 430-35.G.R.

Situated on the east coast of Yorkshire at the mouth of the River Esk, Whitby has an established maritime, mineral and tourist heritage. Its East Cliff is home to the ruins of Whitby Abbey, where Caedmon, the earliest recognised English poet, lived. The fishing port emerged during the Middle Ages and developed important herring and whaling fleets,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=58589 |title=Blessing The Herring Fleet – British Pathe |work=britishpathe.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.whitbyonline.co.uk/whitbyhistory/whaling.php |title=Whaling in Whitby – Whitby Online |work=whitbyonline.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011[/tpl] and was (along with the nearby fishing village of Staithes) where Captain Cook learned seamanship. Tourism started in Whitby during the Georgian period and developed further on the arrival of the railway in 1839. Its attraction as a tourist destination is enhanced by its proximity to the high ground of the North York Moors [[National parks of England and Wales|
National Park]], its Heritage Coastline and by its association with the horror novel Dracula. Jet and alum were mined locally. Whitby Jet, which was mined by the Romans and Victorians became fashionable during the 19th century.
The earliest record of a permanent settlement is in 656, when as Streonshal it was the place where Oswy, the Christian king of Northumbria, founded the first abbey, under the abbess Hilda. The Synod of Whitby was held there in 664. In 867, the monastery was destroyed by Viking raiders, and was re-founded in 1078. It was in this period that the town gained its current name, Whitby, (from "white settlement" in Old Norse). In the following centuries Whitby functioned as a fishing settlement until, in the 18th century, it developed as a port and centre for shipbuilding and whaling, the trade in locally mined alum and the manufacture of Whitby jet jewellery.
The abbey ruin at the top of the East Cliff is the town's oldest and most prominent landmark. Other significant features include  the swing bridge, which crosses the River Esk and the harbour, which is sheltered by the grade II listed East and West piers. The town's  maritime heritage is commemorated by statues of Captain Cook and William Scoresby, as well as the whalebone arch that sits at the top of the West Cliff. The town also has a strong literary tradition and has featured in literary works, television and cinema, perhaps most famously in Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula.
While Whitby's cultural and historical heritage contribute to the local economy, the town does suffer from the economic constraints of its remote location, ongoing changes in the fishing industry, relatively underdeveloped transport infrastructure and limitations on available land and property.  As a result, tourism and some forms of fishing remain the mainstay of its economy. It is the closest port to a proposed wind farm development in the North Sea, [tpl]convert|47|mi|km|[/tpl] from York and [tpl]convert|22|mi|km|[/tpl] from Middlesbrough. There are transport links to the rest of North Yorkshire and North East England, primarily through national rail links to Middlesbrough and road links to Teesside, via both the A171 and A174, and Scarborough by the former.
According to the 2011 UK census, the town had a population of 13,213,[ref]

[tpl]For|other people with a similar name|Victor de Broglie (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Victor de Broglie|[/tpl]

Victor François de Broglie, 2nd duc de Broglie (19 October 1718, Paris – 30 March 1804)  was a French aristocrat and soldier and a marshal of France. He served with his father, François-Marie, 1st duc de Broglie, at Parma and Guastalla, and in 1734 obtained a colonelcy.
In the War of the Austrian Succession he took part in the storming of Prague in 1742, and was made a brigadier. In 1744 and 1745 he saw further service on the Rhine, and he succeeded his father as 2nd duc de Broglie on the old duke's death in 1745.  He was made a Maréchal de Camp, and he subsequently served with Marshal de Saxe in the Low Countries, and was present at Roucoux, Val and Maastricht. At the end of the war he was made a Lieutenant-general.
During the Seven Years' War he served successively under Louis Charles César Le Tellier, duc d'Estrées, Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise, and Contades, being present at all the battles from Hastenbeck onwards. His victory over Prince Ferdinand at Bergen (1759) won him the rank of marshal of France from the French King Louis XV and the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire Reichsfürst  from Emperor Francis I.
In 1759 he won the Battle of Bergen and followed that with the capture the city of Minden, later fighting at the Battle of Minden under the command of Contades whom he would succeed in command. In 1760 he won an action at the Korbach, but was defeated at Villinghausen in 1761. After the war he fell into disgrace and was not recalled to active employment until 1778, when he was given command of the troops designed to operate against Great Britian, when France intervened on the The Thirteen Colonies' side during the American war of independence. He played a prominent part in the French Revolution, which he opposed with determination; he commanded troops at Versailles in July 1789 and briefly served as Louis XVI's minister of war before fleeing France. After his emigration, the duc de Broglie commanded the "Army of the Princes" for a short time (1792).
Since the duke's eldest son, Charles-Louis-Victor, prince de Broglie, died in the Terror, the succession fell to his grandson, who became the third duc de Broglie. He died at Münster in 1804.

[[Pepsin]]
CATEGORIES: EC 3.4.23, Peptidase, Stomach

Pepsin is an enzyme whose zymogen (pepsinogen) is released by the chief cells in the stomach and that degrades food proteins into peptides.  It was discovered in 1836 by Theodor Schwann who also coined its name from the Greek word πέψις pepsis, meaning "digestion" (from πέπτειν peptein "to digest").[tpl]cite journal | author=Florkin M | title=Discovery of pepsin by Theodor Schwann. | language=French | journal=Rev Med Liege | volume=12 | issue=5 | pages=139–44 |date=March 1957 | pmid=13432398[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Asimov, Isaac | title=A short history of biology | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, Conn | year=1980 | chapter=page 95 | isbn=0-313-22583-4 | accessdate=[/tpl] It was the first enzyme to be discovered, and, in 1929, it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized, by John H.

Pepsin is one of three principal protein-degrading, or proteolytic, enzymes in the digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. The three enzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.[tpl]cite journal | author=Dunn BM | title=Overview of pepsin-like aspartic peptidases | journal=Curr Protoc Protein Sci | volume=Chapter 21 | pages=Unit 21.3 |date=November 2001 | pmid=18429164 | doi=10.1002/0471140864.ps2103s25| isbn=0471140864 [/tpl]

The reaction occurs as follows:                  
More specifically, urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to produce ammonia and carbamate, the carbamate produced is subsequently degraded by spontaneous hydrolysis to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zimmer|first=Marc|date=Apr 2000|title=Molecular mechanics evaluation of the proposed mechanisms for the degradation of urea by urease|journal=J Biomol Struct Dyn.|volume=17|issue=5|pages=787–97|doi=10.1080/07391102.2000.10506568|pmid=10798524|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07391102.2000.10506568|accessdate=2013-04-29[/tpl] Urease activity tends to increase the pH of the environment in which it is as it produces ammonia, as it is a basic molecule.

[[Primary election]]
CATEGORIES: Primary elections, Voting systems

A primary election is an election that narrows the field of candidates before an election for office. Primary elections are one means by which a political party or a political alliance nominates candidates for an upcoming general election or by-election.
Primaries are common in the United States, where their origins are traced to the progressive movement to take the power of candidate nomination from party leaders to the people.[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=Kevin B.|title=Governing States and Localities|year=2011|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-60426-728-0|pages=189–190[/tpl]
Other methods of selecting candidates include caucuses, conventions, and nomination meetings.  Historically, Canadian political parties chose their candidates through nominating conventions held by constituency riding associations.  Canadian party leaders are elected at leadership conventions, although some parties have abandoned this practice in favor of one member, one vote systems.

Jacques Alexandre César Charles (November 12, 1746 – April 7, 1823) was a French inventor, scientist, mathematician, and balloonist.
Charles wrote almost nothing about mathematics, and most of what has been credited to him was due to mistaking him with another Jacques Charles, also a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, entering on May 12, 1785.  He was sometimes called Charles the Geometer.  (See J. B. Gough, Charles the Obscure, Isis 70, #254, pgs 576-579)  
Charles and the Robert brothers launched the world's first (unmanned) hydrogen-filled balloon in August 1783; then in December 1783, Charles and his co-pilot Nicolas-Louis Robert ascended to a height of about 1,800 feet (550 m) in a manned balloon. Their pioneering use of hydrogen for lift led to this type of balloon being named a Charlière (as opposed to a Montgolfière which used hot air).
Charles's law, describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was formulated by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Jacques Charles.
Charles was elected to the Académie des Sciences, in 1795 (J B GOUGH, Charles the Obscure, Isis, 70 #254, pgs 576,579), and subsequently became professor of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers.

The Vickers-Armstrongs Valiant was a British four-jet bomber, once part of the Royal Air Force's V bomber nuclear force in the 1950s and 1960s. The Valiant was the first of the V bombers to become operational, and was followed by the Handley Page Victor and the Avro Vulcan; however it was noticeably less advanced than its counterparts. Several Valiants were soon converted to perform various support roles, such as aerial refuelling tankers and reconnaissance aircraft. 
The Valiant was originally intended for operations as high-level strategic bomber; advances in anti-aircraft technologies meant that a low-level mission profile was assumed. However, continuous low-level flight led to a number of serious problems as the Valiant's wing spar attachment castings showed premature fatiguing and inter-crystalline corrosion traced to the use of an inappropriate type of aluminium alloy. Rather than proceeding with an expensive rebuilding program, the Valiant was formally retired in 1965. Its duties were continued by the other V-bombers which remained in service until the 1980s.

[[Cryopump]]
CATEGORIES: Vacuum pumps, Gases, Gas technologies

A cryopump or a "cryogenic pump" is a vacuum pump that traps gases and vapours by condensing them on a cold surface. They are only effective on some gases, depending on the freezing and boiling points of the gas relative to the cryopump's temperature. They are sometimes used to block particular contaminants, for example in front of a diffusion pump to trap backstreaming oil, or in front of a McLeod gauge to keep out water. In this function, they are called a cryotrap or cold trap, even though the physical mechanism is the same as for a cryopump. Cryotrapping can also refer to a somewhat different effect, where molecules will increase their residence time on a cold surface without actually freezing. There is a delay between the molecule impinging on the surface and rebounding from it.  Kinetic energy will have been lost, the molecules slow down. For example, hydrogen will not condense at 8 kelvin, but it can be cryotrapped. This effectively traps molecules for an extended period and thereby removes them from the vacuum environment just like cryopumping.

In criminal justice, clearance rate is calculated by dividing the number of crimes that are "cleared" (a charge being laid) by the total number of crimes recorded. Clearance rates are used by various groups as a measure of crimes solved by the police. 
Clearance rates can be problematic for measuring the performance of police services and for comparing various police services. This is because a police force may employ a different way of measuring clearance rates. For example, each police force may have a different method of recording when a "crime" has occurred and different criteria for determining when a crime has been "cleared." One police force may appear to have a much better clearance rate because of its calculation methodology.The encyclopedia of police science, Volume 1 By Jack R. Greene, http://books.google.ca/books?id=HIE_zF1Rv7MC&lpg=PA907&ots=fVuvhI2iZL&dq=definition%20%22clearance%20rate%22%20police&pg=PA907#v=onepage&q=definition%20%22clearance%20rate%22%20police&f=false
In System Conflict Theory, it is argued that clearance rates cause the police to focus on appearing to solve crimes (generating high clearance rate scores) rather than actually solving crimes. Further focus on clearance rates may result in effort being expended to attribute crimes (correctly or incorrectly) to a criminal, which may not result in retribution, compensation, rehabilitation or deterrence.

A holograph is a document written entirely in the handwriting of the person whose signature it bears. Some countries (e.g. France) or local jurisdictions within certain countries (e.g. some U.S. states) give legal standing to specific types of holographic documents, generally waiving requirements that they be witnessed. One of the most important types of such documents are holographic last wills.

Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, KG, PC (13 May 1730 – 1 July 1782), styled The Hon. Charles Watson-Wentworth before 1733, Viscount Higham between 1733 and 1746, Earl of Malton between 1746 and 1750 and The Earl Malton in 1750, was a British Whig statesman, most notable for his two terms as Prime Minister of Great Britain. He became the patron of many Whigs, known as the Rockingham Whigs, and served as a leading Whig grandee. He served in only two high offices during his lifetime (Prime Minister and Leader of the House of Lords), but was nonetheless very influential during his one and a half years of service.

[[Onion skinning]]
CATEGORIES: Animation techniques, Computer graphic techniques

Onion skinning is a  2D computer graphics term for a technique used in creating animated cartoons and editing movies to see several frames at once. This way, the animator or editor can make decisions on how to create or change an image based on the previous image in the sequence. 
In traditional cartoon animation, the individual frames of a movie were initially drawn on thin onionskin paper over a light source. The animators (mostly inbetweeners) would put the previous and next drawings exactly beneath the working drawing, so that they could draw the 'in between'  to give a smooth motion.
In computer software, this effect is achieved by making frames translucent and projecting them on top of each other.
This effect can also be used to create motion blurs, as seen in The Matrix when characters dodge bullets.

[[Color confinement]]

CATEGORIES: Gluons, Quantum chromodynamics, Quark matter

Color confinement, often simply called confinement, is the phenomenon that color charged particles (such as quarks) cannot be isolated singularly, and therefore cannot be directly observed. Quarks, by default, clump together to form groups, or hadrons. The two types of hadrons are the mesons (one quark, one antiquark) and the baryons (three quarks). The constituent quarks in a group cannot be separated from their parent hadron, and this is why quarks can never be studied or observed in any more direct way than at a hadron level.

[[Twig]]

CATEGORIES: Plant morphology

A twig is a small thin terminal branch of a woody plant. The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away.  The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig.
There are two types of twig, vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs.  Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and leading twigs, and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past.  The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, down the length of the twig.

An unnamed narrator wanders through the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. The narrator implies that he died in some horrible accident and is a ghost drifting through the palace. In each room, he encounters various real and fictional people from various periods in the city's 300-year history. He is accompanied by "the European", who represents the Marquis de Custine, a nineteenth-century French traveler. Russian Ark uses the fourth wall device extensively, but repeatedly broken and re-erected.

Examples include bacterial lipoproteins, G proteins and certain kinases. It is believed that the fatty acid chain inserts and assumes a place in the bilayer structure of the membrane alongside the similar fatty-acid tails of the surrounding lipid molecules. Potential points of attachment include the terminal amino group of the protein backbone and the side chain of cysteine residues.
Prenylation is the attachment of lipid chains to proteins to facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane. Some important prenylation chains are geranylgeraniol, farnesol and dolichol, all products of the HMG-CoA reductase metabolic pathway.
Lipid anchored proteins are found within the lipid bilayer. The exact function of the anchor protein has been the subject of much speculation, but it appears to act as an intracellular signal that targets proteins to the apical surface in polarized cells.
Other anchors include the GPI anchor.

Mecano was a Spanish pop band formed in 1981 and active until 1992. Mecano became one of the most successful Spanish pop bands of all time. The band is still the best-selling Spanish band to this date, reaching over 25 million albums worldwide.[tpl]cite web|title=Grupo Mecano|url=http://www.grupomecano.com/historia.php|accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl] They had a brief comeback in 1998. They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time.[tpl]cite web|title=Billboard|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=mecano|bio=true[/tpl]|accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl]
The band's lineup was singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and José María Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Mañó, Javier Quílez, Ángel Celada and Óscar Astruga.
The trio's musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band; while on the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, dance, flamenco, bossanova, tango, salsa, rumba, bolero, paso doble,  and even reggae.
The unprecedented success also hit Latin America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they had an impact on non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their Une femme avec une femme. That foreign song remains to this date the one which has been for the most weeks at the top of the French charts.
Some of their biggest number one singles include, Me Cuesta Tanto Olvidarte, La Fuerza del Destino, Hijo de la Luna, Cruz de Navajas, Une femme avec une femme (Mujer contra Mujer, a worldwide number one hit) or El 7 de Septiembre among many others.

[[Intuitionistic logic]]

CATEGORIES: Logic in computer science, Non-classical logic, Constructivism (mathematics), Systems of formal logic, Intuitionism

Semantically, intuitionistic logic is a restriction of classical logic in which the law of excluded middle and double negation elimination are not admitted as axioms. Excluded middle and double negation elimination can still be proved for some propositions on a case by case basis, however, but do not hold universally as they do with classical logic.
Several semantics for intuitionistic logic have been studied. One semantics mirrors classical Boolean-valued semantics but uses Heyting algebras in place of Boolean algebras. Another semantics uses Kripke models.
Intuitionistic logic is practically useful because its restrictions produce proofs that have the existence property, making it also suitable for other forms of mathematical constructivism. Informally, this means that if you have a constructive proof that an object exists, you can turn that constructive proof into an algorithm for generating an example of it.
Formalized intuitionistic logic was originally developed by Arend Heyting to provide a formal basis for Brouwer's programme of intuitionism.

Macrophages have the unique ability to metabolize one amino acid, arginine, to either a "killer" molecule (nitric oxide) or a "repair" molecule (ornithine).  Macrophages predominantly expressing the killer phenotype are called M1 macrophages, whereas those involved in tissue repair are called M2 macrophages.[tpl]cite pmid|23428224[/tpl] Their role is to phagocytose, or engulf and then digest, cellular debris and pathogens,  either as stationary or as mobile cells.

They are present in all living tissues, and have a function in regeneration.
Macrophages can be identified by specific expression of a number of proteins including CD14, CD40, CD11b, CD64, F4/80 (mice)/EMR1 (human), lysozyme M, MAC-1/MAC-3 and CD68 by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining.[tpl]cite journal |author=Khazen, W., M'bika, J.

[[CHSH inequality]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum measurement, Inequalities

In physics, the CHSH inequality can be used in the proof of Bell's theorem, which states that certain consequences of entanglement in quantum mechanics cannot be reproduced by local hidden variable theories. Experimental verification of violation of the inequalities is seen as experimental confirmation that nature cannot be described by local hidden variables theories. CHSH stands for John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony and Richard Holt, who described it in a much-cited paper published in 1969 (Clauser et al., 1969). They derived the CHSH inequality, which, as with John Bell's original inequality (Bell, 1964),[tpl]citation |author=J.S. Bell |title= |year=1964 |journal=Physics |volume=1 |pages=195–200[/tpl], reproduced as Ch. 2 of [tpl]citation |author=J. S.

CATEGORIES: The Beatles bootleg recordings

The Beatles' bootleg recordings (also known as "Beatlegs") are recordings of performances by The Beatles that have attained some level of public circulation without being available as a legal release. The term most often refers to audio recordings, but also includes video performances. From the earliest Beatles bootlegs in the late 1960s, the group has been one of the most bootlegged rock artists.Heylin (2004), p. 8.
Bootleg recordings arise from a multitude of sources, including broadcast performances, recordings of live shows, test discs, privately distributed copies of demos, and covertly copied studio session tapes. The largest single source of Beatles bootleg material is the set of Nagra audio tapes from the 1969 filming of the Get Back / Let It Be rehearsal and recording sessions. Performances for the BBC, stage and concert recordings, and studio outtakes have also been extensive sources for Beatles bootlegs.

The Far Side is a single-panel comic created by Gary Larson and syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, which ran from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 1995. Its surrealistic humor is often based on uncomfortable social situations, improbable events, an anthropomorphic view of the world, logical fallacies, impending bizarre disasters, (often twisted) references to proverbs, or the search for meaning in life. Larson's frequent use of animals and nature in the comic is popularly attributed to his background in biology. Reruns are still printed in many newspapers.
The Far Side was ultimately carried by more than 1,900 daily newspapers, translated into 17 languages, and collected into calendars and 22 compilation books.
The series was preceded by a similar panel called Nature's Way, also by Larson.

Transkei represented a significant precedent and historic turning point in South Africa's policy of apartheid and "separate development"; it was the first of four territories to be declared independent of South Africa. Throughout its existence, it remained an internationally unrecognised, diplomatically isolated, politically unstable de facto one-party state, which at one point broke relations with South Africa, the only country that acknowledged it as a legal entity. In 1994, it was reintegrated into its larger neighbour and became part of the Eastern Cape province.

[[Herbes de Provence]]

CATEGORIES: Herbs, Herb and spice mixtures, Provence, French cuisine

Herbes de Provence ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɛʁb.də.pʁɔ.vɑ̃s[/tpl]) is a mixture of dried herbs typical of Provence.  Formerly simply a descriptive term referring to herbs typical of Provence, in the 1970s, commercial blends started to be sold under this name.Laget, p. 134 These mixtures typically contain savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano and, for the American market, lavender leaves, and other herbs, though lavender was not used in traditional southern French cooking.It does not appear at all in the best-known compendium of Provençal cooking, J.-B. Reboul's Cuisinière Provençale (1910)
As the name "Herbes de Provence" is generic, and not a Protected Geographical Status, there is no guarantee that Herbes de Provence in fact come from Provence; indeed, the vast majority of these blends come from central and eastern Europe, North Africa, and China.[tpl] cite book | editor = Jacques Marseille | title = Dictionnaire de la Provence et de la Côte d'Azur | publisher = Éd. Larousse | location = Paris | year = 2002 | isbn = 2035751055 | page = 382 [/tpl]
Herbes de Provence are used to flavour grilled foods such as fish and meat, as well as vegetable stews. The mixture can be added to foods before or during cooking or mixed with cooking oil prior to cooking so as to infuse the flavour into the cooked food. They are rarely added after cooking is complete.
Herbes de Provence are often sold in larger bags than other herbs, and the price in Provence is considerably lower than other herbs.
Provençal cuisine has traditionally used many herbs, which were often characterized collectively as "herbes de Provence", but not in standard combinations, and not sold as a mixture:
 ...the famous mixtures of herbes de Provence... were unknown to
 my Provençal grandmothers, who used, individually and with discernment, thyme,
rosemary and savory gathered in the countryside.Laget, p. 138
It was in the 1970s that standard mixtures were formulated by spice wholesalers, including notably Ducros in France (now part of McCormick & Company).

In logic, necessity and sufficiency are implicational relationships between statements.  The assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient  condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false.[tpl]cite book|last=Betz|first=Frederick|title=Managing Science: Methodology and Organization of Research|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-7487-7|page=247[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K.I.|title=Reasoning and Thinking|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|location=East Sussex, UK|isbn=0-86377-708-2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Asnina, Erika; Osis, Janis; and Jansone, Asnate|title=Formal Specification of Topological Relations|journal=Databases and Information Systems VII|date=2013|page=175|doi=10.3233/978-1-61499-161-8-175|accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl] 
In ordinary English, ‘necessary’ and ‘sufficient’ indicate relations between  conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother. Fred’s being a male sibling is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the statement that Fred is a brother.

[[Radio-frequency identification]]

CATEGORIES: Automatic identification and data capture, Emerging technologies, Privacy, Radio-frequency identification, Ubiquitous computing, Wireless

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Some tags are powered by and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields (electromagnetic induction). Others use a local power source such as a battery, or else have no battery but collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies). Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters. Unlike a barcode, the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of sight of the reader, and may be embedded in the tracked object.
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is part of the family of Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) technologies that includes 1D and 2D bar codes. RFID uses an electronic chip, usually applied to a substrate to form a label, that is affixed to a product, case, pallet or other package. The information it contains may be read, recorded, or rewritten.Packaging Digest (2014) http://www.packagingdigest.com/rfid
RFID tags are used in many industries.  An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line. Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses. Livestock and pets may have tags injected, allowing positive identification of the animal. 
Since RFID tags can be attached to cash, clothing, everyday possessions, or even implanted within people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Communications of the ACM |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=90–96 |title= RFID and the end of cash? |author= Angell, I., Kietzmann, J. |doi=10.1145/1183236.1183237 | url=http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl]

[[ANDOS]]

CATEGORIES: Elektronika BK operating systems, Software written in assembly language

ANDOS is a Russian operating system for Electronika BK-0010, Electronika BK-0011 and Electronika BK-0011M series computers. It was created in 1990 and first released in 1992. Initially it was developed by Alexey Nadezhin (by whose name the system is named) and later also by Sergey Kamnev, who joined the project. It was the only widespread system on BK series computers that used MS-DOS-compatible file system format. ANDOS used the FAT12 filesystem on 800 Kb floppy disks. For Electronika BK-0011M and Electronika BK-0011 ANDOS provided Electronika BK-0010 emulation by loading BK-0010 ROM image into BK-0011(M) RAM. In minimal configuration the system was able to occupy less than 4 Kb of RAM.
The system was able to support up to 64 disk drives (or hard drive partitions) as well as RAM disks in the computer's memory and tape recording. It also was able to have read-only access to MicroDOS file system format disks, although in the last version this function was transferred from system core to the file manager and became optional.

The Electronika BK was a series of 16-bit PDP-11-compatible Soviet home computers developed by NPO Scientific Center, the leading Soviet microcomputer design team at the time. It was also responsible for the more powerful UKNC and DVK micros. First released in 1985, they were based on the К1801ВМ1 (Soviet LSI-11-compatible CPU) and were the only "official"Government approved and accounted for in economic planning Soviet home computer design in mass production.
They initially sold for about 600-650 rubles. This was expensive,The average Soviet wage was about 150 rubles per month at the time. but marginally affordable, so they became one of the most popular home computer models in the Soviet Union despite numerous problems. Later, when that price edge was eclipsed by cheaper ZX Spectrum clones, their powerful CPU and straightforward, easy to program design made them popular as demo machines. BK (БК) is a Russian abbreviation which stands for [tpl]lang|ru|"Бытовой Компьютер"[/tpl] -- domestic (or home) computer. It was also for a short time used as cash register, for example, in the State Universal Store.

Mount Etna (Latin: Aetna, Sicilian: Mungibeddu or a Muntagna) is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, close to Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano on the European continent, currently [tpl]convert|3329|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high, though this varies with summit eruptions. It is the highest mountain in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of [tpl]convert|1190|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] with a basal circumference of 140 km. This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide in Tenerife surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Italy/description_italy_volcanics.html|title=Italy volcanoes and Volcanics|publisher=USGS[/tpl] In Greek Mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said to also be located underneath it.Aelian, Hist.

Mount Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost constant state of activity. The fertile volcanic soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/DecadeVolcanoes/framework.html|title=Decade Volcanoes|publisher=United States Geological Survey[/tpl] In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.italymagazine.com/news/mount-etna-becomes-world-heritage-site| title=Mount Etna Becomes a World Heritage Site |publisher=Italy Magazine |date=4 May 2013[/tpl]

[[Foundations of mathematics]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical logic, History of mathematics, Philosophy of mathematics

Foundations of mathematics is the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function...) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms...) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.
The foundations of mathematics as a whole does not aim to contain the foundations of every mathematical topic.
Generally, the foundations of a field of study refers to a more-or-less systematic analysis of its most basic or fundamental concepts, its conceptual unity and its natural ordering or hierarchy of concepts, which may help to connect it with the rest of human knowledge. The development, emergence and clarification of the foundations can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most interesting part.
Mathematics always played a special role in scientific thought, serving since ancient times as a model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination of the nature and criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.
The systematic search for the foundations of mathematics started at the end of the 19th century and formed a new mathematical discipline called mathematical logic, with strong links to theoretical computer science.
It went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the 20th century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components (set theory, model theory, proof theory...), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field.
Its high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of Palau, Government of Palau

Palau gained its independence October 1, 1994, with the entry into force of the Compact of Free Association with the United States. Palau was the last Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands territories to gain its independence. Under the Compact, the U.S. remains responsible for Palau's defense for 50 years.
Palau is a sovereign nation and conducts its own foreign relations. Since independence, Palau has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including many of its Pacific neighbors. Palau was admitted to the United Nations on December 15, 1994, and has since joined several other international organizations. In 2004, Stuart Beck was appointed to serve as Palau's first permanent representative to the United Nations. Along with the other former Trust Territories, Palau is one of a handful of countries that regularly votes with Israel in the United Nations General Assembly. Palau established relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, instead of the People's Republic of China, in 1999. Palau established relations with India in April 1995.

Dan Dare is a   British science fiction comic hero, created by illustrator Frank Hampson who also wrote the first stories, that is, the Venus and Red Moon stories, and a complete storyline for Operation Saturn.  Dare appeared in the Eagle comic story Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future in 1950, dramatised seven times a week on Radio Luxembourg.
The stories were set in the late 1990s, but the dialogue and manner of the characters is reminiscent of British war films of the 1950s. Dan Dare has been described as "Biggles in Space" and as the British equivalent of Buck Rogers. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated comic-strip artwork by Hampson and other artists, including Harold Johns, Don Harley, Bruce Cornwell, Greta Tomlinson, Frank Bellamy and Keith Watson.
The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by Virgin Comics.  It was written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Gary Erskine and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in Spaceship Away, a specialist magazine created by Rod Barzilay by agreement with the Dan Dare Corporation. Published three times a year, its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original Eagle left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the fifties stories. Despite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), Spaceship Away continues to appear.

In criminal law, kidnapping is the taking away or transportation of a person against that person's will, usually to hold the person in false imprisonment, a confinement without legal authority. This may be done for ransom or in furtherance of another crime, or in connection with a child custody dispute. When it is done with legal authority, it is often called arrest or imprisonment.
In some countries such as the United States a large number of child abductions arise after separation or divorce when one parent wishes to keep a child against the will of the other or against a court order. In these cases, some jurisdictions[tpl]Which|date=March 2012[/tpl] do not consider it kidnapping if the child, being competent, agrees.

[[Margites]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek mock-heroic poems, Lost poems, Homer

The Margites is a comic mock-epic of Ancient Greece that is largely lost. From references to the work that survived, we know that its central character is an exceedingly dumb man named "Margites" (from ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|μάργος[/tpl], margos, "raving, mad; lustful") who was so dense he did not know which parent had given birth to him.Stuart Kelly, The Book of Lost Books, New York: Random House, 2005. His name gave rise to the recherché adjective margitomanēs ([tpl]lang|grc|μαργιτομανής[/tpl]), "mad as Margites", used by Philodemus.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon revised edition, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940.
It was commonly attributed to Homer, as by Aristotle (Poetics 13.92): "His Margites indeed provides an analogy: as are the Iliad and Odyssey to our tragedies, so is the Margites to our comedies"; but the work, among a mixed genre of works loosely labelled "Homerica" in Antiquity, was more reasonably attributed to Pigres, a Greek poet of Halicarnassus, in the massive medieval Greek encyclopedia called Suda. It is written in mixed hexameter and iambic lines, an odd whim of Pigres, who also inserted a pentameter line after each hexameter of the Iliad as a curious literary game.Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquity, New York, 1898.
Margites was famous in the ancient world, but only these following lines passed from Medieval tradition:
Fortunately, in Oxyrhynchus, a few papyrus fragments were found and published (P.Oxy 2309, 3693 and 3694). The collected fragments were included in volume II of Iambi et Elegi Graeci ante Alexandrum cantati by M.L. West.

CATEGORIES: Emotions, Feeling, Mental processes, Pleasure

Pleasure describes the broad class of mental states that humans and other animals experience as positive, enjoyable, or worth seeking. It includes more specific mental states such as happiness, entertainment, enjoyment, ecstasy, and euphoria. In psychology, the pleasure principle describes pleasure as a positive feedback mechanism, motivating the organism to recreate in the future the situation which it has just found pleasurable. According to this theory, organisms are similarly motivated to avoid situations that have caused pain in the past.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The experience of pleasure is subjective and different individuals will experience different kinds and amounts of pleasure in the same situation. Many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives, such as eating, exercise, sex or defecation. Other pleasurable experiences are associated with social experiences and social drives, such as the experiences of accomplishment, recognition, and service. The appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as art, music, and literature is often pleasurable.
In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the brain mechanisms underlying pleasure.[tpl]cite book|author=Kringelbach, M.L|coauthors= K.C. Berridge |title=Pleasures of the brain |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010| isbn=0-19-533102-8 [/tpl] One of the key discoveries was made by Kent C. Berridge who has shown that pleasure is not a unitary experience. Rather, pleasure consists of multiple brain processes including liking, wanting and learning subserved by distinct yet partially overlapping brain networks.Berridge, K.C., Kringelbach, M.L. (2008) Affective neuroscience of pleasure: Reward in humans and other animals. Psychopharmacology 199, 457–80. In particular, this research has been helped by the use of objective pleasure-elicited reactions in humans and other animals such as the behavioral ‘liking’/‘disliking’ facial expressions to tastes that are homologous between humans and many other mammals.Videos of Pleasure-elicited Reactions.
Recreational drug use can be pleasurable: some drugs, illicit and otherwise, directly create euphoria in the human brain when ingested. The mind's natural tendency to seek out more of this feeling (as described by the pleasure principle) can lead to dependence and addiction. Berridge and Robinson have proposed that addiction results from drugs hijacking the ‘wanting’ system through a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system.Robinson, T.E., Berridge, K.C. 1993 The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction.

Happiness is a mental or emotional state of well-being characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy.Wordnet 3.0 (accessed 2011-Feb-24 via Wolfram Alpha)  A variety of biological, psychological, religious, and philosophical approaches have striven to define happiness and identify its sources. Various research groups, including positive psychology, endeavor to apply the scientific method to answer questions about what "happiness" is, and how it might be attained. It is of such fundamental importance to the human condition that "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" were deemed to be unalienable rights by the United States Declaration of Independence.
Philosophers and religious thinkers often define happiness in terms of living a good life, or flourishing, rather than simply as an emotion. Happiness in this sense was used to translate the Greek Eudaimonia, and is still used in virtue ethics.

Destiny's Child was an American R&B girl group whose final, and perhaps most recognizable, line-up comprised Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical endeavors as Girl's Tyme comprising, among others,Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) – Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV.com Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. After years of limited success, they were signed in 1996 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the 1999 release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall, which contained the number-one singles "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Say My Name". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.
Both Roberson and Luckett were soon replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, in 2000, Franklin was dismissed, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, Survivor, which contains themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, contains the worldwide hits "Independent Women", "Survivor" and "Bootylicious". In 2002, they announced a hiatus and re-united two years later for the release of their fourth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004).

TLC is an American girl group whose repertoire spans R&B, hip hop, soul, funk and new jack swing. TLC originally comprised singer Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins, rapper Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes and singer Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas. The group was very successful in the 1990s and early 2000s in spite of numerous spats with the law, each other, and the group's record label.

CATEGORIES: Club DJs, Electronic music duos, Musical groups established in 1994, 1994 establishments in the United Kingdom

Sasha & John Digweed are a pair of DJs from the United Kingdom.  John Digweed had been DJ-ing for ten years before getting a gig at Renaissance where he met Sasha, who had been working the past few years in various acid house clubs and raves.  Together, he and Sasha honed their DJ skills, focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities.  In 1994, they released the triple CD mix album Renaissance: The Mix Collection on Renaissance Records.  It contained many popular dance hits of the time from artist such as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice as well as original productions and remixes from the duo themselves.  Two years later, the duo became "true superstars" (AllMusic) with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound.  This release was brought to the United States the next year in a single CD package on Ultra Records.  1997 saw the release of the Northern Exposure 2 double CD mix album, again on Ministry of Sound.  Sasha and Digweed toured internationally, helping define the sound of progressive house & trance music in the late '90s.  In 1998, both John Digweed and Sasha released separate mix albums on Boxed as part of the Global Underground series with Digweed's GU 006: Sydney and Sasha's GU 009: San Francisco release.
In the late '90s, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City's famous Twilo nightclub as well as releasing their third edition in the Northern Exposure series: Northern Exposure: Expeditions.  They both continued their success in the Global Underground series with Digweed's GU 014: Hong Kong and Sasha's GU 013: Ibiza.  In addition to their residency, they toured the United States, especially to promote their DJ mix Communicate in 2000.  Shortly thereafter, they embarked on their international Delta Heavy Tour in 2002.  They have collaborated little since Delta Heavy. They appeared together at the 2007 Bonnaroo Music Festival, and counted down the new year during a 4 hour set in Los Angeles at Together As One.
In 2008 Sasha & Digweed announced their plans to do another tour of North America taking in 21 cities in one month, as they announced the Sasha and John Digweed Spring Club Tour 2008. The tour began at the Winter Music Conference on March 27 at the club Mansion. This was the first time they toured North America together in six years.
In 2009 Sasha & Digweed headlined the very successful SW4 festival in London's Clapham Common.

[[Metamagical Themas]]

CATEGORIES: 1985 books, Philosophy books, Cognitive science literature, Books by Douglas Hofstadter, Basic Books books, Works originally published in American magazines

Metamagical Themas is an eclectic collection of articles that Douglas Hofstadter wrote for the popular science magazine Scientific American during the early 1980s. The anthology was published in 1985 by Basic Books.
The subject matter of the articles is loosely woven about themes in philosophy, creativity, artificial intelligence, typography and fonts, and important social issues. The volume is substantial in size and contains extensive notes concerning responses to the articles and other information relevant to their content.  (One of the notes—page 65—suggested memetics for the study of memes.)
Major themes include: self-reference in memes, language, art and logic; discussions of philosophical issues important in cognitive science/AI; analogies and what makes something similar to something else (specifically what makes, for example, an uppercase letter 'A' recognizable as such); and lengthy discussions of the work of Robert Axelrod on the prisoner's dilemma, as well as the idea of superrationality.
The concept of superrationality, and its relevance to the Cold War, environmental issues and such, is accompanied by some amusing and rather stimulating notes on experiments conducted by the author at the time. Another notable feature is the inclusion of two dialogues in the style of those appearing in Gödel, Escher, Bach. Ambigrams are mentioned.
There are three articles centered on the Lisp programming language, where Hofstadter first details the language itself, and then shows how it relates to Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Two articles are devoted to Rubik's Cube and other such puzzles. Many other topics are also mentioned, all in Hofstadter's usual easy, approachable style. Many chapters open with an illustration of an extremely abstract alphabet, yet one which is still recognizable as such.
The game of Nomic was first introduced to the public in this column, in June 1982, when excerpts from a book (still unpublished at the time) by the game's creator Peter Suber were printed and discussed.
The title is an example of wordplay: it is an anagram of Mathematical Games, the title of Martin Gardner's column that Hofstadter's column succeeded in Scientific American. The index mentions Hofstadter's recurring alter ego, Egbert B. Gebstadter.

This Brick Gothic construction is one of the relics of Lübeck’s medieval city fortifications and the only remaining city gate, except for the Citadel Gate ("Burgtor"). Because its two round towers and arched entrance are so well known it is regarded today as a symbol of this German city, and together with the old city centre (Altstadt) of Lübeck it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

Every individual transmembrane segment of a protein also has topology, depending on location of its N-terminus on the inner or outer side of the membrane. There are several databases which provide topologies of membrane proteins including Uniprot, TOPDBTOPDB: topology data bank of transmembrane proteinsTOPDB database  and ExTopoDB.ExTopoDB: a database of experimentally derived topological models of transmembrane proteins There are several computational methods for predicting transmembrane domains, both for helices and β-barrels.Links to topology prediction methods in Expasy[tpl]cite web|last=Bagos|first=P.G|title=PRED-TMBB, A Hidden Markov Model method, capable of predicting and discriminating beta-barrel outer membrane proteins.|url=http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/|accessdate=4 August 2012[/tpl]

Sextus Julius Frontinus (ca. 40–103 AD) was one of the most distinguished Roman senators of the late 1st century AD.  He is best known to the post-Classical world as an author of technical treatises, especially De aquaeductu, dealing with the aqueducts of Rome.
In 70 AD, he was praetor, and five years later was sent into Britain to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis as governor of that island. He subdued the Silures and other tribes of Wales hostile to Roman invasion, establishing a new base at Caerleon or Isca Augusta for Legio II Augusta and a network of smaller forts fifteen to twenty kilometres apart for his auxiliary units. One of these forts would have been Luentinum, which controlled the gold mine of Dolaucothi, worked by numerous aqueducts. He was succeeded by Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78. Agricola was the father-in-law of the famous historian Tacitus.
In 95, he was appointed Water Commissioner of the aqueducts (curator aquarum) at Rome by the emperor Nerva, an office only conferred upon persons of very high standing. He was also a member of the College of Augurs. He produced an official report on the state of the aqueducts serving the city of Rome towards the end of the 1st century AD, the first official report of an investigation about engineering works ever to have been published.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In this capacity, he followed another distinguished Roman statesman, Agrippa, the friend, ally and son-in-law of Augustus, who organised in 34 BC a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct  Aqua Marcia and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city.

Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, [tpl]ussc|438|265|1978[/tpl] was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States.  It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy.  However, the court ruled that specific quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible.
Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities was unresolved.  Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds.
Allan P. Bakke, an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission by several, in part because, in his early thirties, he was considered too old.  After twice being rejected by U.C.-Davis, he brought suit in state court.  The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted.  The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention.
The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis Powell; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion.  Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Nevertheless, U.C.-Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted.  The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.

CATEGORIES: Japanese cuisine, Surimi, Japanese cuisine terms

[tpl]nihongo|Kamaboko|蒲鉾[/tpl] is a type of cured surimi, a Japanese processed seafood product, in which various white fish are pureed, combined with additives such as MSG, formed into distinctive loaves, and then steamed until fully cooked and firm. The steamed loaves are then sliced and served unheated (or chilled) with various dipping sauces or sliced and included in various hot soups, one-dish meals, or noodle dishes. Kamaboko is typically sold in semicylindrical loaves. Some kamaboko include artistic patterns, such as the pink spiral on each slice of narutomaki, named after the well-known tidal whirlpool near the Japanese city of Naruto.
Although the Japanese name for kamaboko is sometimes used outside of Japan (cf., sushi), some extant English names for kamaboko are fish paste, fish loaf, fish cake, and fish sausage (Tsuji, 1980). Tsuji recommends using the Japanese name in English because no adequate English name exists, though the Jewish dish gefilte fish is somewhat similar.
Red-skinned and white kamaboko are typically served at celebratory and holiday meals, as red and white are considered to bring good luck. 
Kamaboko has been made in Japan since the 14th century CE and is now available nearly worldwide. The simulated crab meat product kanikama (short for kani-kamaboko), the best-known form of surimi in the West, is a type of kamaboko. In Uwajima, a type of fried kamaboko called jakoten is popular. In Japan, chīkama (cheese plus kamaboko) is commonly sold in convenience stores as a pre-packaged snack food.

[[Popular monarchy]]

CATEGORIES: Monarchy, Popular sovereignty

Popular monarchy is a system of monarchical governance in which the monarch's title is linked with a popular mandate rather than a constitutional state.[tpl]Citation | title = The Evolution of Popular Monarchy | first = Kinglsey | last = Martin | journal = Political Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–78 | date = 24 Aug 2005[/tpl].  It was the norm in some places (such as Scotland) from the Middle Ages, and was occasionally used in 19th- and 20th-century Europe, often reflecting the results of a populist revolution.  Thus during the French Revolution Louis XVI had to change his title to indicate he was the monarch of the people rather than sovereign ruler of the land.
Currently, Belgium has the only explicit popular monarchy. Constitutional monarchy in the modern sense can be considered an evolution of the idea, as such constitutions generally place sovereignty with the people, not the monarch.

Don Camillo is one of two protagonists, the other being the communist mayor of the town, known to everyone as Peppone.  The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as a "small world" and are an excellent representation of what rural Italy was like after the second world war.  Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine Candido, founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca.  These "Little World" ("Mondo Piccolo") stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.

Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers. They are often brightly colored or unusually shaped to attract pollinators. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a corolla. Petals are usually accompanied by another set of special leaves called sepals, that collectively form the calyx and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the perianth. When the petals and sepals of a flower look similar they are called tepals. Examples of plants in which the term tepal is appropriate include genera such as Aloe and Tulipa. Conversely, genera such as Rosa and Phaseolus have well-distinguished sepals and petals.

Mesrine repeatedly escaped from prison and made international headlines during a final period as a fugitive when his exploits included trying to kidnap a judge who had sentenced him. An aptitude for disguise earned him the moniker "The Man of a Thousand Faces" and enabled him to remain at large while receiving massive publicity as a wanted man. Mesrine was widely seen as an anti-establishment 'Robin Hood' figure. In keeping with his charismatic image, he was rarely without a glamorous female companion.

The 1944 Summer Olympics, which were to be officially known as the Games of the XIII Olympiad, were cancelled due to World War II. They were to have been held in London, England, United Kingdom, which won the bid on the first ballot in a June 1939 IOC election over Rome, Detroit, Lausanne, Athens, Budapest, Helsinki and Montreal.

After a technical evaluation of the nine original bids, the top five were shortlisted on 18 May 2004, becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig and Rio de Janeiro—were eliminated.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/election_uk.asp |title=London 2012 Election |work=Olympic Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=24 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070403014504/http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/election_uk.asp| archivedate= 3 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Four of the five candidate cities were prominent national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On 6 July 2005, in a four-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC (gathered at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore), Moscow, New York City and Madrid were eliminated in the first three rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.
In the month after the election, members of the Paris 2012 delegation argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair. A public statement by IOC President Jacques Rogge dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair. Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series Panorama revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member Ivan Slavkov and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours. Still recovering from the effects of the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.

Flexography (often abbreviated to flexo) is a form of printing process which utilizes a flexible relief plate. It is essentially a modern version of letterpress which can be used for printing on almost any type of substrate, including plastic, metallic films, cellophane, and paper. It is widely used for printing on the non-porous substrates required for various types of food packaging (it is also well suited for printing large areas of solid color).

[[Anilox]]
CATEGORIES: Printing terminology

In printing, anilox is a method used to provide a measured amount of ink to a flexo printing plate.
An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells. Depending on the design of the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roll. A doctor blade is used to scrape excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material.
The characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate: angle of the cells, cell volume, and line screen. A 60 percent angle ensures maximum density in a given space. Lower volume makes for less ink. Low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed, whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing. Both cell volume and line screen are closely correlated.        
Anilox rolls are often specified by their line screen, which is the number of cells per linear inch. These often range from around 250 to upwards of 2000, though the precise numbers vary by manufacturer. Most rolls sold are within 800 LPI, although a spike in demand for those with 800-1200 lines has been seen.  Anilox rolls are almost always designed to be removed from the press for cleaning and for swapping out with different line screen rolls. Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen. Low line screen rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in four-color process work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate anilox rolls for a given print job.
Though large wide-web flexo rolls are only maneuverable by overhead crane, on smaller presses anilox rolls are often handled directly by operators. Extreme caution must be taken when handling these pieces of hardware as a single bump against a hard surface or sharp corner can destroy the delicate cell structure on the surface and render a roller completely useless, at a cost of around [tpl]USD[/tpl]5000 for even small narrow-web rollers. Nicks and scratches add up quickly, so fine brushes (never brass brushes) are used for cleaning the anilox roll. Similarly, anilox rollers that are used with water, solvent and oil based inks, which dry when left sitting out and unagitated, must be cleaned immediately after use or a problem known as plugging occurs, where minuscule amounts of ink dry in the cells. This leaves tiny, but unacceptable, pinholes in anything printed from the roll in the future.
Anilox rolls were originally made using a diamond pecking machine, but modern rolls are laser engraved.

[[Suede]]
CATEGORIES: Leather

Suede [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|eɪ|d[/tpl] is a type of leather with a napped finish, commonly used for jackets, shoes, shirts, purses, furniture and other items. The term comes from the French "gants de Suède", which literally means "Swedish gloves".Suede at Dictionary.com
Suede leather is made from the underside of the skin, primarily lamb, although goat, calf and deer are commonly used. Splits from thick hides of cow and deer are also sueded, but, due to the fibre content, have a shaggy nap. Because suede does not include the tough exterior skin layer, suede is less durable but softer than standard ("full-grain") leather. Its softness, thinness, and pliability make it suitable for clothing and delicate uses; suede was originally used for women's gloves. Suede leather is also popular in upholstery, shoes, bags, and other accessories, and as a lining for other leather products. Due to its textured nature and open pores, suede may become dirty and quickly absorb liquids.

Suede are an English alternative rock band from London, formed in 1989. The group's most prominent early line-up was Brett Anderson (singer), Bernard Butler (guitarist), Mat Osman (bass guitarist) and Simon Gilbert (drummer). By 1992, Suede were described as "The Best New Band in Britain",Melody Maker, April 1992 and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede, went to the top of the charts by becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. The album won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster Britpop as a musical genre. However, the band's lush follow-up, Dog Man Star (1994), showed Suede distancing itself from its Britpop peers. Although it is often regarded as the band's masterpiece, the recording sessions for Dog Man Star were fraught with difficulty, and ended with Butler departing the band after confrontations with Anderson and musical differences with the rest of the band. Its sales suffered due to these events, however it was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has, over time been lauded with universal acclaim from critics.
In 1996, following the recruitment of Richard Oakes and later keyboard player Neil Codling, Suede went on to greater commercial success with Coming Up. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and became Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. In 1997, Anderson became addicted to crack and heroin. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album Head Music (1999) was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however it garnered a mixed reaction dividing both fans and critics. Suede's fifth album, A New Morning (2002), the first after the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial disappointment, and the group disbanded the following year. After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, Bloodsports, on 18 March 2013. The album was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK.

[[Ingenuity]]

CATEGORIES: Innovation

Ingenuity is the quality of being clever, original, and inventive, often in the process of applying ideas to solve problems or meet challenges. For example, the process of figuring out how to cross a mountain stream using a fallen log, building an aeroplane model from a sheet of paper, or starting a new company in a foreign culture all involve the exercising of ingenuity. Human ingenuity has led to various technological developments through applied science, and can also be seen in the development of new social organizations, institutions and relationships. Ingenuity involves the most complex human thought processes, bringing together our thinking and acting both individually and collectively to take advantage of opportunities and/or overcome problems.
One example of how ingenuity is used conceptually can be found in the analysis of Thomas Homer-Dixon, building on that of Paul Romer, to refer to what is usually called instructional capital. In the case of Homer-Dixon, his use of the phrase 'ingenuity gap' denotes the space between a challenge and a solution. His particular contribution is to explore the social dimensions of ingenuity. Typically we think of ingenuity being used to build faster computers or more advanced medical treatments. Homer-Dixon argues that as the complexity of the world increases, our ability to solve the problems we face is becoming critical. Human ingenuity is also included in many school systems, with most teachers encouraging students to be educated in human ingenuity.
These challenges require more than improvements arising from physics, chemistry and biology, as one will need to consider the highly complex interactions of individuals, institutions, cultures, and networks involving all of the human family around the globe. Organizing ourselves differently, communicating and making decisions in new ways, are examples of social ingenuity. If one's ability to generate adequate solutions to these problems is inadequate, the ingenuity gap will lead to a wide range of social problems. The full exploration of these ideas in meeting social challenges is featured in The Ingenuity Gaphttp://www.ingenuitygap.com/, one of Thomas Homer-Dixon's earliest books. 
In another of Homer-Dixon's books, The Up Side of Downhttp://www.theupsideofdown.com/, he argues that increasingly expensive oil, driven by scarcity, will lead to great social instability. Walking across an empty room requires very little ingenuity. If the room is full of snakes, hungry bears and land mines, the ingenuity requirement will have gone up considerably.
Ingenuity is often inherent in creative individuals, and thus is considered hard to separate from individual capital. It is not clear if Dixon or Romer considered it impossible to do so, or if they were simply not familiar with the prior analysis of "applied ideas", "intellectual capital", "talent", or "innovation" where instructional and individual contributions have been carefully separated, by economic theorists.

[[Fifth force]]

CATEGORIES: Interaction, Force

Modern physics describes physical reality in terms of four known fundamental forces.  However, since physics has no accepted universal framework, occasionally physicists have postulated the existence of an additional fundamental fifth force. Most postulate a force of roughly the strength of gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the nuclear forces) and to have a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales.

[[Online dating service]]

CATEGORIES: Online dating services, Intimate relationships, Social software

Online dating (OD) or Internet dating is a dating experience that allows individuals to contact and communicate with one another over the Internet. This experience is usually with the objective of developing a personal, romantic, or sexual relationship. Online dating services usually provide unmoderated matchmaking over the Internet, through the use of personal computers or cell phones.
Online dating services require a member to provide personal information, before they can search the service provider's database for other individuals. Members use criteria other members set, such as age range, gender and location.
Online dating sites use market metaphors to match people up. Match Metaphors are conceptual frameworks that allow individuals to make sense of new concepts by drawing upon familiar experiences and frame-works. This metaphor of the marketplace – a place where people go to “shop” for potential romantic partners and to “sell” themselves in hopes of creating a successful romantic relationship – is highlighted by the layout and functionality of online dating websites. The marketplace metaphor may also resonate with participants’ conceptual orientation towards the process of ﬁnding a romantic partner.[tpl]cite journal|last=Heino|first=R.|coauthors=N. Ellison, J. Gibbs|title=Relationshopping: Investigating the market  metaphor in online dating.|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=2010|pages=427–447[/tpl]  Most sites allow members to upload photos or videos of themselves and browse the photos and videos of others. Sites may offer additional services, such as webcasts, online chat, telephone chat (VOIP), and message boards. Some sites provide free registration, but may offer services which require a monthly fee. Other sites depend on advertising for their revenue. Some sites such as OKCupid, Plenty of Fish and Badoo are free and offer additional paid services in a freemium revenue model.[tpl]cite web|author=December 13, 2011, by Brian Anthony Hernandez 7 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/12/13/badoo-unveils-features-to-help-shy-users-flirt/ |title=Badoo Unveils Features to Help Shy Users Flirt |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-07-17[/tpl]
Some sites are broad-based, with members coming from a variety of backgrounds looking for different types of relationships. Other sites are more specific, based on the type of members, interests, location, or relationship desired. A 2005 study of data collected by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that individuals are more likely to use an online dating service if they use the internet for a greater amount of tasks and less likely to use such a service if they are trusting of others.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kang|first=Tanya|coauthors=Lindsay H.

[[Meeting system]]
CATEGORIES: Meetings, Management

A meeting system is any systemic means of improving meetings, workshops or conferences.  They are particularly important in consensus decision making and deliberative democracy, but they have always been recognized as important to judicial procedure and parliamentary procedure, down to the level of the town meeting or below.
There are many such systems, of which one of the best-known is probably Robert's Rules of Order, which is applied in parliamentary debate and corporate meetings in many English-speaking countries.  Also well-known is the cross-examination debate applied in both criminal law and civil law. Much innovation in meeting systems has come from objection to these two basic models, notably because both reflect an adversarial process.
When used in political or economic contexts, meeting systems are very often associated with a voting system.  When used in matchmaking or other sexual/romantic contexts, a meeting system is considered a dating system.  These are discussed in other articles.

Body Count is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1990. The group is fronted by Ice-T, who co-founded the group with lead guitarist Ernie C. out of their interest in heavy metal music. Ice T. took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of the group's songs. Lead guitarist Ernie C has been responsible for writing the group's music. Their controversial self-titled debut album was released on Sire Records in 1992.
The song "Cop Killer" was the subject of much controversy. Although Sire Records' parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the single, Ice-T chose to remove the track from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year. Since then, they have released three further albums on different labels, none of which have been received as commercially or critically well as their debut album.
Three out of the band's original five members are deceased: D-Roc died from lymphoma, Beatmaster V from leukemia and Mooseman in a drive-by shooting.

Mother Love Bone was an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington in 1988. The band was active from 1988 to 1990. Frontman Andrew Wood's personality and compositions helped to catapult the group to the top of the burgeoning late 1980s/early 1990s Seattle music scene. Wood died only days before the scheduled release of the band's debut album, Apple, thus ending the group's hopes of success. The album was finally released a few months later.

Leonard "Chico" Marx (March 22, 1887 – October 11, 1961) was an American comedian and film star as part of the Marx Brothers. His persona in the act was that of a charming, dim-witted albeit crafty con artist, seemingly of rural Italian origin, who wore shabby clothes, and sported a curly-haired wig and Tyrolean hat.  In virtually every film that includes the main trio of the Marx Brothers, Chico is seen working with Harpo Marx, usually as partners-in-crime.
Leonard was the oldest of the Marx Brothers, though he was not the first-born; he was preceded by Manfred Marx, who died in infancy. In addition to his work as a performer, he played an important role in the management and development of the act, at least in its early years.

[[Irish states since 1171]]

CATEGORIES: History of Ireland

Irish states have existed under a number of different names for nearly a thousand years. A unified Irish proto-state had been coalescing from the multitude of small tribal kingdoms that existed circa AD 500, similar to the pattern elsewhere in Europe. The independent development of the several dynastic regional kingdoms into a nascent national kingdom, however, was extinguished by the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, although these regional Gaelic Ireland kingdoms continued to resist for centuries until the Tudor conquest of Ireland was completed in the 17th century.
This list deals with the various states that existed from 1171 onwards that owed their origin to Norman and later, English involvement on the island of Ireland. These were recognised by the Holy See before 1570 and after 1766. Until the whole island was subdued following the end of the Nine Years' War in 1603 these states shared the island of Ireland with a patchwork of indigenous states that existed outside of their authority.
The list below refers to all-Ireland (or nominally all-Ireland) states and to the 1922 post-partition states, not the individual Gaelic kingdoms which exercised the actual governance in their area when they existed, including during the 1350-1500 "Gaelic resurgence". 
For international purposes the British monarch was also King of Ireland until 1949, after which time the President of Ireland became the foreign sovereign. The Monarch's internal powers had already been removed by 1937. With the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Act in 1949, all powers of the British monarch were transferred to the president. The name of the state remained Ireland, even after the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act, see names of the Irish state.

Tino rangatiratanga is a Māori language term that can be interpreted as 'absolute sovereignty'. It appears in the Māori version of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed by the British Crown and Māori chiefs (rangatira) in 1840. It has become one of the most contentious phrases in retrospective analyses of the Treaty, amid debate surrounding the obligations agreed to by each signatory. The phrase features in current historical and political discourse on race relations in New Zealand, and is widely used by Māori advocacy groups. A flag based on tino rangatiratanga was designed in 1990, which has now become a representative flag for Māori across New Zealand.

[[Taonga]]

CATEGORIES: Māori words and phrases, Māori culture

A taonga in Māori culture is a treasured thing, whether tangible or intangible. This is the current modern definition which differs from the historical definition that was noted by Hongi Hika as "property procured by the spear" could understand this as war booty or defended property.
Tangible examples are all sorts of heirlooms and artefacts, land, fisheries, natural resources such as geothermal springs[tpl]cite web| title =Ngawha Geothermal Resource Report 1993 (Wai 304)| publisher=Waitangi Tribunal| year =1993|url= http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/summary.asp?reportid={25C730E6-2C3B-47DC-933E-2549E11ACDA4}| accessdate=3 Oct. 2011[/tpl] and access to natural resources, such as riparian water rights and access to the riparian zone of rivers or streams. Intangible examples may include language, spiritual beliefs and radio frequencies.

[[Māori language revival]]

CATEGORIES: Education in New Zealand, Language revival, Māori language

The Māori language revival is a movement to promote, reinforce and strengthen the speaking of the Māori language. Primarily in New Zealand, but also in centres with large numbers of New Zealand migrants (such as London and Melbourne), the movement aims to increase the use of Māori in the home, in education, government and business. The movement is part of a broader Māori Renaissance.
Until World War II (1939–1945) most Māori people spoke Māori as their first language but by the 1980s fewer than 20% of Māori spoke the language well enough to be classed as native speakers. The causes of the decline included the switch from using Māori to using English compulsory in schools and increasing urbanisation, which disconnected younger generations from their extended families and in particular their grandparents, who traditionally played a large part in family life. Even many of those people no longer spoke Māori in the home. As a result, many Māori children failed to learn their ancestral language, and generations of non-Māori-speaking Māori emerged.
Māori leaders began to recognize the dangers of the loss of their language and initiated Māori-language recovery-programs such as the Kōhanga Reo (literally, "language nest"Te Kohanga Reo - Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka o Maui) movement, which from 1982 immersed infants in Māori from infancy to school age. There followed in the later 1980s the founding of the Kura Kaupapa Māori, a primary-school programme in Māori.

[[Instance variable]]
CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming, Variable (computer programming)

In object-oriented programming, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to and contrasts with a class variable. In languages like Java, C#, and C++ a class variable is defined using the Static variable declaration modifier while an instance variable is defined without said modifier.
The assigned value of a class variable is the same across all objects instantiated from a given class. An example of a class variable would be private static point equatorLatitude = 0. This value will be the same across each object you instantiate, as one would want to use a consistent value for each object. By contrast, the scope of an instance variable is the instance (or copy) of the object you are invoking. The instance variable is declared in the class, and may be given a default value like private point currLatitude = 0. However the current location referenced in one object may be San Francisco, USA, and you would want to override the default value to currLatitude = 37.7750, but another object may reference La Paz, Bolivia and you would instead want currLatitude = 16.4942. Each class variable and instance variable you invoke with the object lives in memory for the life of that object.http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html
A simple definition is that instance variables are things an object knows about itself, but the class does not know about. All instances of an object have their own copies of instance variables, even if the value is the same from one object to another. One object instance can change values of its instance variables without affecting all other instances. Changing the value of a class variable changes that value for all objects. Instance variables can be used by all methods of a class unless the method is declared as static. You access instance variables directly from their containing object instances.http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/General/JavaSyntax/static.html

[[Imperial British Conservative Party]]

CATEGORIES: Australian fringe and underground culture, Defunct political parties in Australia, Defunct political parties in New Zealand, Joke political parties

The Imperial British Conservative Party was a farcical political party founded by The Wizard of New Zealand. It was dedicated to the grand traditions of British Imperialism in the face of capitalism, globalisation and the distinct lack of culture in Christchurch, New Zealand.
The Imperial British Conservative Party also had a presence in Australia, especially during the republican debate of the 1990s. One of its candidates, Cecil G. Murgatroyd, had run for parliament in several Australian federal elections, at each time standing against the Prime Minister (initially Bob Hawke). In official statements, Murgatroyd listed his occupation as "dole bludger". At other times, Murgatroyd stood under the banner of another New Zealand joke party, the McGillicuddy Serious Party.
In one Australian election in the 1980s, the party promised to dye the Speaker's wig a conservative blue.

Imperium is a Latin word which, in a broad sense, translates roughly as 'power to command'. In ancient Rome, different kinds of power or authority were distinguished by different terms. Imperium referred to the sovereignty of the state over the individual.Encyclopædia Britannica, Empire.  University of Chicago, 1962. Vol. 8, p. 402  It is not to be confused with auctoritas or potestas, different and generally inferior types of power in the Roman Republic and Empire.  Primarily used to refer to the power that is wielded, in greater or lesser degree, by an individual to whom it is delegated, the term could also be used with a geographical connotation, designating the territorial limits of that imperium. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule magistrates or promagistrates. These included the curule aedile, the praetor, the censor, the consul, the magister equitum, and the dictator.

Muller v. Oregon, [tpl]ussc|208|412|1908[/tpl], was a landmark decision in United States Supreme Court history, as it justifies both sex discrimination and usage of labor laws during the time period. The case upheld Oregon state restrictions on the working hours of women as justified by the special state interest in protecting women's health. The ruling had important implications for protective labor legislation. The case was decided a mere three years after Lochner v.

Only once during its history was Amsterdam both "capital" and seat of government. Between 1808 and 1810, during the Kingdom of Holland, King Louis Napoleon resided in Amsterdam and declared the city capital of his kingdom and seat of government. To accommodate the king, the grand seventeenth-century Town Hall of Amsterdam, prime example of the republican values that were prevalent for so long in the Netherlands, was converted into a Royal Palace.
In 1810 the Netherlands were annexed by the French Empire and King Louis Napoleon was replaced by a French governor, who took up residence in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. From 1810 to 1813 Amsterdam kept its position of capital city somewhat, as Emperor Napoleon declared the city to be the third city of the Empire (after Paris and Rome) and an imperial residence. In December 1813, after the fall of Napoleon and the accession of Prince William VI of Orange as Sovereign of the Netherlands, The Hague was restored as the seat of government.

[[Elaine Riddick Jessie]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 births, Living people, People from North Carolina

Elaine Riddick Jessie (born Elaine Riddick in 1954) is an African-American woman who, as a 14-year-old girl in 1968, was forcibly sterilized by the Eugenics Board of North Carolina, which argued that she was "feebleminded" and "promiscuous."
Prior to the sterilization (at age 13), Jessie had been kidnapped, molested, and raped. Her son, Tony Riddick, states, "The work of the Eugenics Board was not far from the thinking of Hitler." 
Jessie was living with her grandmother, Maggie "Miss Peaches" Woodard, when a social worker discovered her pregnancy.  The illiterate Woodard signed an X on a consent form, not knowing what it was, only that if she didn't sign, Elaine would be sent to an orphanage.  The Perquimans County Department of Public Welfare had earlier custody of Jessie and her 7 siblings (from their alcoholic parents), sending 5 to an orphanage, and Elaine and one of her sisters to live with Woodard.
In March 2003 Mrs. Jessie and other victims of the Eugenics Board spoke out against the atrocities committed to the Eugenics Study Committee. As she said "When you're a little girl, what do you want? You want to be a mommy. To find out that's been taken away from you is devastating.".N.C.

[[Eugenics Board of North Carolina]]

CATEGORIES: Eugenics in the United States, History of North Carolina

The Eugenics Board of North Carolina (EBNC) was a State Board  of the state of North Carolina formed in July 1933 by the North Carolina State Legislature by the passage of House Bill 1013, entitled 'An Act to Amend Chapter 34 of the Public Laws of 1929 of North Carolina Relating to the Sterilization of Persons Mentally Defective'. This Bill formally repealed a 1929 law,  which had been ruled as unconstitutional by the North Carolina Supreme Court earlier in the year.
Over time, the scope of the Board's work broadened from a focus on pure eugenics to considering sterilization as a tool to combat poverty and welfare costs. Its original purpose was to oversee the practice of sterilization as it pertained to inmates or patients of public-funded institutions that were judged to be 'mentally defective or feeble-minded' by authorities. In contrast to other eugenics programs across the United States, the North Carolina Board enabled county departments of public welfare to petition for the sterilization of their clients. The Board remained in operation until 1977. During its existence thousands of individuals were sterilized. In 1977 the N.C. General Assembly repealed the laws authorizing its existence, though it would not be until 2003 that the involuntary sterilization laws that underpinned the Board's operations were repealed.
Today the Board's work is repudiated by people across the political, scientific and private spectrum.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  North Carolina is currently considering compensation for those sterilized under the Board's jurisdiction.

[[Falconry]]
CATEGORIES: Falconry, Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, World Digital Library related

Falconry is the hunting of wild quarry in its natural state and habitat by means of a trained bird of prey.  There are two traditional terms used to describe a person involved in falconry: a falconer flies a falcon; an austringer (German origin) flies a hawk (Accipiter and some buteos and similar) or an eagle (Aquila or similar). In modern falconry the Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and the Harris hawk are often used. The words "hawking" and "hawker" have become used so much to mean petty traveling traders, that the terms "falconer" and "falconry" now apply to all use of trained birds of prey to catch game.
In early English falconry literature, the word "falcon" referred to a female falcon only, while the word "hawk" or "hawke" referred to a female hawk.  A male hawk or falcon was referred to as a "tiercel" (sometimes spelled "tercel") as it was roughly one third less than the female in size.[tpl]Citation | last = Bert | first = E | year = 1619 | title = An Approved Treatise on Hawks and Hawking[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Latham | first = S | year = 1633 | title = The Falcon's Lure and Cure[/tpl]. Many contemporary practitioners still use these words in their original meaning.  The practice of hunting with a conditioned falconry bird is also called "hawking" or "gamehawking".

Walter Dorwin Teague (December 18, 1883 - December 5, 1960) was an American industrial designer, architect, illustrator, graphic designer, writer, and entrepreneur. Often referred to as the "Dean of Industrial Design", Teague pioneered in the establishment of industrial design as a profession in the US, along with Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, and Henry Dreyfuss.
Regarded as a classicist and a traditionalist despite a later shift to modern tastes, Teague is recognized as a critical figure in the spread of mid-century modernism in America. He is widely known for his exhibition designs during the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, such as the Ford Building, and his iconic product and package designs, from Eastman Kodak's Bantam Special to the steel-legged Steinway piano.
A self-described late starter whose professional acclaim began as he approached age 50, Teague sought to create heirlooms out of mass-produced manufactured objects, and frequently cited beauty as "visible rightness". In 1926, Teague assembled an industrial design consultancy (now known as Teague), which carries on his legacy today, in name and vision.

The 1900 Summer Olympics, today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1900 in Paris, France. No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and sailor Hélène de Pourtalès became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest.
At the Sorbonne conference of 1895, Pierre de Coubertin  proposed that the Olympic Games should take place in 1900 in Paris. The delegates  to the conference were unwilling to wait five years and lobbied to hold the first games in 1896. A decision was made to hold the first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens and that Paris would host the second celebration.
Most of the winners in 1900 did not receive medals, but were given cups or trophies. Professionals competed in fencing and Albert Robert Ayat (France), who won the épée for amateurs and masters, was awarded a prize of 3000 francs.
Some unusual events were contested for the only time in the history of the Games including automobile and motorcycle racing,Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 8, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge ballooning,Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 13, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge cricket,Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 32, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge croquet,Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 33, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge Basque pelota,Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 52, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge and 200m swimming obstacle race and underwater swimming.Journal of Olympic History, Special Issue - December 2008, The Official Publication of the International Society of Olympic Historians, p. 77, by Karl Lennartz, Tony Bijkerk and Volker Kluge This was also the only Olympic Games in history to use live animals (pigeons) as targets during the shooting event.[tpl]cite web |last=Carmichael |first=Emma |url=http://gawker.com/5929259/gawkers-guide-to-the-olympic-sports-youre-pretty-sure-dont-exist-shooting |title=Gawker's Guide to the Olympic Sports You're Pretty Sure Don't Exist: Shooting |publisher=Gawker |date=July 27, 2012[/tpl]

A melon is any of various plants of the family Cucurbitaceae with edible, fleshy fruit (e.g. gourds or cucurbits). The word "melon" can refer to either the plant or specifically to the fruit. Many different cultivars have been produced, particularly of muskmelons.
Although the melon is a botanical fruit (specifically, a berry), some varieties may be considered culinary vegetables rather than fruits. The word melon derives from Latin melopepo, which is the latinization of the Greek μηλοπέπων (mēlopepon), meaning "melon", itself a compound of μῆλον (mēlon), "apple"Liddell et al, "μῆλον" + πέπων (pepōn), amongst others "a kind of gourd or melon".Liddell et al, "πέπων"

[[Spinach]]

CATEGORIES: Leaf vegetables, Amaranthaceae, Flora of Nepal, Plants described in 1753

Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is an edible  flowering plant in the family of Amaranthaceae. It is native to central and southwestern Asia. It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), which grows to a height of up to 30 cm. Spinach may survive over winter in temperate regions.  The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular-based, very variable in size from about 2–30 cm long and 1–15 cm broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm diameter, maturing into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm across containing several seeds.
Common spinach, Spinacia oleracea, was long considered to be in the Chenopodiaceae family, but in 2003, the Chenopodiaceae family was combined with the Amaranthaceae family under the family name 'Amaranthaceae' in the order Caryophyllales. Within the Amaranthaceae family, Amaranthoideae and Chenopodioideae are now subfamilies, for the amaranths and the chenopods, respectively.

Its local government area is Litchfield Municipality. The town is a popular stopping point for tourists travelling between Darwin and Kakadu National Park, and boasts many attractions of its own. The main industries are agriculture and tourism; however, most residents commute to Darwin or Palmerston for work, and many regard the town more as an outer suburb.
The locality of Humpty Doo is named after the station originally called ‘Umpity Doo’; however, origins of the name are uncertain.  Three derivations have been suggested:

The standard language was originally created by Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian alternative to the Danish language which was commonly written in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has later on been significantly altered, and a minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace have stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk ([tpl]lang-en|High or Elevated Norwegian[/tpl]).
In the local communities, 27% of the Norwegian municipalities have declared Nynorsk as their official language form, and these comprise about 12% of the Norwegian population. Nynorsk is the majority form of the four counties Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane and Møre og Romsdal, which together comprise the region of Vestlandet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://språkrådet.no/Politikk-Fakta/Fakta/Spraakstatistikk/Hovudtal/|title=Språkstatistikk – nokre nøkkeltal for norsk |accessdate=2007-09-12[/tpl]

[[Dewberry]]

CATEGORIES: Rubus, Berries, Plant common names

The dewberries are a group of species in the genus Rubus, section Rubus, closely related to the blackberries. They are small trailing (rather than upright or high-arching) brambles with berries reminiscent of the raspberry, but are usually purple to black instead of red. Unlike many other Rubus species, dewberries have separate male and female plants (they are dioecious) (Burbank, methods and applications 3, AD 1914).[tpl]cn|reason=needs full citation, or at least full title|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Dewberries are common throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere, sometimes thought of as a nuisance weed, but the leaves can be used for a tea, and the berries are sweet and edible. They can be eaten raw, or used to make cobbler, jam, or pie.
Around March and April, the plants start to grow white flowers that develop into small green berries.  The tiny green berries grow red and then a deep purple-blue as they ripen. When the berries are ripe, they are tender and difficult to pick in any quantity without squashing them. The plants do not have upright canes like some other Rubus species, but have stems that trail along the ground, putting forth new roots along the length of the stem. The stems are covered with fine spines or stickers. The berries are sweet and, for many, less seedy than blackberries and worth the scratches and stains that come from picking them. 
In the winter the leaves often remain on the stems, but may turn dark red. The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including peach blossom moths.
The European dewberry, Rubus caesius, grows more upright like other brambles, but is frequently restricted to coastal communities, especially sand dune systems. Its fruits are a deep, almost black, purple and are coated with a thin layer or 'dew' of waxy droplets. Thus, they appear sky-blue (caesius is Latin for pale blue). It is less sought after, because its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe.

[[Box camera]]

CATEGORIES: Cameras by type

The box camera is mechanically simple, the most common form is a cardboard or plastic box with a lens in one end and film at the other. The lenses are often single element designs meniscus fixed focus lens, or in better quality box cameras a doublet lens with minimal (if any) possible adjustments to the aperture or shutter speeds. Because of the inability to adjust focus, the small lens aperture and the low sensitivity of the sensitive materials available, these cameras work best in brightly lit daylit scenes when the subject is within the hyperfocal distance for the lens and of subjects that move little during the exposure -- snapshots. During the box cameras heyday, box cameras with photographic flash, shutter and aperture adjustment were introduced, allowing indoor photos.

[[Climbing gourami]]
CATEGORIES: Anabantidae, Fish of Southeast Asia, Fish of Thailand, Amphibious fish

The Anabantidae are a family of perciform fish commonly called the climbing gouramies or climbing perches.  As labyrinth fishes, they possess a labyrinth organ, a structure in the fish's head which allows it to breathe atmospheric oxygen.  Fish of this family are commonly seen gulping at air at the surface of the water.  The air is held in a structure called the suprabranchial chamber, where oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream via the respiratory epithelium covering the labyrinth organ. 
Of the four genera, Anabas is found from South Asia (they are called chemballi (Malayalam: ചെമ്പല്ലി) in Kerala, India), east to China and Southeast Asia. The remaining three genera are all restricted to Africa.  They are primarily  freshwater fishes and only very rarely are found in brackish water.  As egg-layers, they typically guard their eggs and young.
Climbing gouramis are so named due to their ability to "climb" out of water and "walk" short distances. Their method of terrestrial locomotion uses the gill plates as supports, and the fish pushes itself using its fins and tail.

[[Elections in Sweden]]

CATEGORIES: Elections in Sweden

Elections to determine the makeup of the legislative bodies on the three levels of administrative division in the Kingdom of Sweden are held once every four years. At the highest level, these elections determine the allocation of seats in the Riksdag, the national legislative body of Sweden. Elections to the 20 county councils (landsting) and 290 municipal assemblies (kommunfullmäktige) – all using roughly the same electoral system – are held concurrently with the legislative elections on the second Sunday in September (with effect from 2014; until 2010 they had been held on the third Sunday in September).
Sweden also holds elections to the European Parliament, which unlike Swedish domestic elections are held in June every five years, although they are also held on a Sunday and use an almost identical electoral system. The last Swedish general election was held on 19 September 2010.  The last Swedish election to the European Parliament was held on 7 June 2009.

[[Smilacaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Smilacaceae, Liliales families

Smilacaceae, the greenbrier family, is a family of flowering plants. Up to some decades ago the genera now included in family Smilacaceae were often assigned to a more broadly defined family Liliaceae, but for the past twenty to thirty years most botanists have accepted Smilacaceae as a distinct family. It is considered that the two families evolved[tpl]ambig|date=December 2011[/tpl] around 55 millions years ago during the Early Paleogene possibly near the boundary between Paleocene and Eocene.  One characteristic that distinguishes Smilacaceae from most of the other members of the Liliaceae-like Liliales is that it has true vessels in its conducting tissue. Another is that the veins of the leaves, between major veins, are reticulate (net-shaped), rather than parallel as in most monocots.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=10827  | title = Smilacaceae | work = Flora of North America | accessdate = 2008-01-14 [/tpl]

[[Smilax]]

CATEGORIES: Smilacaceae, Flora of the Eastern United States, Liliales genera, Root vegetables, Stem vegetables

Smilax is a genus of about 300–350 species, found in temperate zones, tropics and subtropics worldwide. In China for example about 80 are found (39 of which are endemic), while there are 20 in North America north of Mexico.Raven & Zhengyi (2000), FNAEC (2002) They are climbing flowering plants, many of which are woody and/or thorny, in the monocotyledon family Smilacaceae, native throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world. Common names include catbriers, greenbriers, prickly-ivys and smilaxes. "Sarsaparilla" (also zarzaparrilla, sarsparilla) is a name used specifically for the Jamaican S. regelii as well as a catch-all term in particular for American species. Occasionally, the non-woody species such as the Smooth Herbaceous Greenbrier (S. herbacea) are separated as genus Nemexia; they are commonly known by the rather ambiguous name "carrion flowers".
Greenbriers get their scientific name from the Greek myth of Krokus and the nymph Smilax.Mifsud (2002) Though this myth has numerous forms, it always centers around the unfulfilled and tragic love of a mortal man who is turned into a flower, and a woodland nymph who is transformed into a brambly vine.  (Compare the story of Barbara Allen and sweet William: They buried Barbara in the old church yard / They buried Sweet William beside her / Out of his grave grew a red, red rose / And out of hers a briar.)

CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming, Variable (computer programming)

In object-oriented programming with classes, a class variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable) of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html|title=The Java Tutorial, Variables |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html|title=The Java Tutorial, Understanding Instance and Class Members|accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions|title=The Python Language Reference, Compound Statements|accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html|title= Objective-C Runtime Reference |accessdate=2010-10-21[/tpl]
A class variable is not an instance variable. It is a special type of class attribute (or class property, field, or data member). The same dichotomy between instance and class members applies to methods ("member functions") as well; a class may have both instance methods and class methods.

Smilax species fall into two groups with distinctive morphologies: one group has woody perennial stems with thorns and a vining habit, while the other group has herbaceous stems that die back to the ground each winter. S. sect. Nemexia is the taxon that comprises the herbaceous species. In the past it was often a genus of its own under the name Nemexia and taxonomists still need further study of the species of Smilax to determine its proper rank.http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&issn=0007-196X&volume=056&issue=02&page=0166Fu, C., H.

However the widely accepted taxonomic system of the Flora of North America does not recognize Nemexia, nor does the AP-site. Thus Nemexia is not currently considered an accepted genus taxon by most plant taxonomists.ISB: Atlas of Florida Vascular Plants
The plants in Smilax, are called carrion flowers for their malodorous flowers and those plants included in section Nemexia also have flowers that smell like rotten meat.  The herbaceous species have greenish-yellow flowers and bloom in spring, they are fly pollinated.

Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix ([tpl]IPA-fr|ø.ʒɛn də.la.kʁwa|lang[/tpl]; 26 April 1798 – 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school.Noon, Patrick, et al., Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism, p. 58, Tate Publishing, 2003. ISBN 1-85437-513-X Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Walter Scott and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic.Gombrich, E.H., The Story of Art, pages 504–6. Phaidon Press Limited, 1995. ISBN 0-7148-3355-X Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the "forces of the sublime", of nature in often violent action.Clark, Kenneth, Civilisation, page 313. Harper and Row, 1969.
However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, "Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible."Wellington, Hubert, The Journal of Eugène Delacroix, introduction, page xiv.

[[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]

CATEGORIES: Arts and media trade groups, Censorship in the United States, Entertainment rating organizations, Entertainment Software Association, Organizations established in 1994, Video game content ratings systems, Video game organizations, Video game trade associations

The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a self-regulatory organization that assigns age and content ratings, enforces industry-adopted advertising guidelines, and ensures responsible online privacy principles for computer and video games in the United States and Canada. The ESRB was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of violent content found in video games such as Night Trap, Mortal Kombat, and other controversial video games portraying excessively violent or intense sexual situations.
The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries, using a combination of six age-based levels intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability, along with a system of "content descriptors" which detail specific types of content present in a particular game. The ESRB also maintains an code of ethics for the advertising and promotion of video games, ensuring that marketing materials for games display their ESRB ratings information, and are targeted to appropriate audiences. The ESRB also operates an online privacy certification program, and in 2011, began a program for rating mobile apps in partnership with CTIA.
Although use of the ESRB ratings system is not enforced by federal law in either the United States and Canada, it is effectively a de facto standard because of how it is treated by the industry: major console manufacturers will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings, most retail stores enforce ESRB ratings, and also do not carry any games which are not rated by the organization. Due to the level of consumer and retail awareness of the ratings system, along with the organization's efforts to ensure that retailers comply with the ratings system and that publishers comply with its marketing code, the ESRB has considered its system to be effective, and was praised by Federal Trade Commission for being the "strongest" self-regulatory organization in the entertainment sector. Despite this, the ESRB has still faced criticism for not rating certain games harshly enough for their violent content, and was also criticized for its handling of objectionable content that could only be accessed through modding.

Regarding the band's name, Andy Kubiszewski said: "essentially when Chris and Walter were putting the band together, they had a gig and there was a deadline for a name for the band, so they pulled out a bunch of album covers and they pulled out a record cover and it had an excerpt from, I believe it was an Eisenhower speech, where he was talking about communism coming to the west and he used the phrase "stabbing westward," and they went oh well, "Stabbing Westward", that will work."http://www.entertainmentavenue.com/concert_hall/q_and_a/stabbing_westward/sw112196.htm

Skinny Puppy is a Canadian electronic music group, formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre.Adem Tepedelen, "Skinny Puppy Bark Back", Rolling Stone, May 20, 2004. http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/skinnypuppy/articles/story/6056448/skinny_puppy_bark_back Access date: October 24, 2008.
Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key while he was in the new wave band Images In Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre. Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986–1995), Dave "Rave" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and "unofficial" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003–present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (1985–1986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others.
After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP Remission in 1984 to their 1992 album Last Rights, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans |title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans |accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=Chartattack|date=2001-07-20|author=Chartattack.com staff[/tpl] fusing elements of ambient, noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing.
In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, The Process. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. The album was completed with Rave and released in Goettel's memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Mark Walk, they have since released three albums on the German label Synthetic Symphony, and toured extensively.

[[Additional Member System]]
CATEGORIES: Semi-proportional electoral systems

The Additional Member System (AMS) is the term used in the United Kingdom for the voting system used in Scotland, Wales and the London Assembly.
AMS is sometimes confused with the mixed member proportional representation system or the parallel voting system, like AMS a semi-proportional voting system. In both cases, some representatives are elected from single-winner geographic constituencies and others are elected under proportional representation from a wider area, usually by party lists. Voters usually have two votes, one for the party and the second for the candidate in a constituency, even if sometimes these votes are combined. The constituency representatives are generally elected under the first-past-the-post voting system. The party representatives are elected by a party vote, where the electors vote for a political party, and usually not directly for an individual. The particular individuals selected come from lists drawn up by the political parties before the election, at a national or regional level. The differences between these systems and the Additional Member System are as follows:

[[Murat & Jose]]

CATEGORIES: Slovenian hip hop groups, Musical groups from Ljubljana

Murat&Jose are a Slovene hip hop duo of writers, producers and MC. Both were born in 1978 in Ljubljana, Slovenia where they still live. Together with Nikolovski they were performing some time under the name Nedotakljivi (The Untouchables). Together they have published one of their first releases on the first Slovene hip hop compilation 5'00" of Fame za narodov blagor (5'00" of Fame for the National Welfare).
The album V besedi je moč (The power is in the word) from 2002 was their first solo LP. Some chosen ones have contributed their share: singer of a Slovene rock group Siddharta Tomi M. for a social conscious single Od ljudi za ljudi (From people for people), duo from Zagreb Bolesna brača for a song Na izi (On easy goin'), a vocalist from Kočevje Semo gave his part of reggae-balkan-soul (ragga banger) for Če hočem (If I want) and Dokler bova skupi (As long as we're together). Nikolovski collaborates with Neki ne štima (Somethin's wrong) and in V besedi je moč.Kdo je gengsta (Whos' the Gangsta) features mysterious Kemal Trofi & Jozafat.
The album was accepted very well as by expert critics as well as the wider audience. It received exceptional reviews in nearly all local media, the constant rotation of the first single SprediZadi (InFrontBehind) on all radio stations and specially of the second single Od ljudi za ljudi, of which music video was regularly performed on TV. V besedi je moč is namely a record which is totally different from all published Slovene hip hop albums. It does not include any curse, it is without regional/sexual/between band provocations, without any detailed descriptions of heroic deeds on the edge of the law or without any aimless wanderings about forbidden substances. 
Murat&Jose had in the past shared the stage with the likes of Das Efx, Afu-Ra, Little Brother and many other well known hip hop acts from all over the globe. Together with Heavy Les Wanted they have also appeared at Slovenia's first edition of mini urban festival Breakbeatnikk.
Murat&Jose have formed a live band in 2007 and the guys are now performing under the name of Murat&Jose Band. They have recently finished recording their new album, recorded fully live with the band. The album entitled Tuki Not is due in September 2008. Its first single Nazaj (Back) featured legendary slovene rock and soul singer Janez Bončina Benč, that came to his fame in the mid seventies. The second single featured local soul singer Maya (Be your own). For both singles the videos were filmed, watch them at Murat&Jose official website.

The Académie Julian ([tpl]IPA-fr|akademi ʒyljɑ̃[/tpl]) was an art school in Paris, France.
Rodolphe Julian established the Académie Julian in 1868 at the Passage des Panoramas, as a private studio school for art students.Tate Gallery, "Académie Julian." The Académie Julian not only prepared students to the exams at the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts, but offered independent training in arts. At that time, women were not allowed to enroll for study to the École des Beaux-Arts, but the new Académie Julian accepted them, providing an alternative education and training. Men and women were trained separately, and women participated in the same studies as men, including the basis of art training – drawing and painting of nude models.Farmer, J. David. "Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the Académie Julian," California Art Club. April/May, 2000.
Like its counterpart, the Académie Colarossi, it was popular with French and foreign students from all over the world, particularly Americans.Russell, John. "An Art School That Also Taught Life," New York Times. 19 March 1989. Eventually, Académie Julian students were granted the right to compete for the Prix de Rome, a prize awarded to promising young artists.[ref]
Chilvers, Ian, ed. (2004).  "Académie," [tpl]Google books|WYaRX58a0_IC| Oxford Dictionary of Art, p. 5–6.|page=5[/tpl][/ref]
The longstanding success of the Academie was secured by the famous and respected artists whom Rodolfo Julian employed as instructors: Adolphe William Bouguereau (1825–1905), Henri Royer, Jean-Paul Laurens, Edgar Chahine, Gabriel Ferrier, Tony Robert-Fleury, Jules Lefebvre and other leading artists of that time, mainly exponents of the academic style.
Over time, Académie Julian opened schools in other locations. In addition to the original school at Passage des Panoramas, studios were at no.28 Boulevard St-Jacques in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, no.5 Rue de Berri in the 8th arrondissement, no. 31 Rue du Dragon in the 6th arrondissement, no. 51, rue Vivienne in the 2nd arrondissement accepting female student artists as of 1880.
In 1888–1889, Les Nabis originated as a rebellious group of young student artists who banded together at the Académie Julian.
Académie Julian integrated with ESAG Penninghen in 1968.

[[Sociology of sport]]

CATEGORIES: Sport and politics, Sports culture

Sociology of sport, alternately referred to as sports sociology, is a sub-discipline of sociology which focuses on sports as social phenomena. It is an area of study concerned with various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and organizations or groups involved with sport.
There are many perspectives through which sport can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, such as: professional vs. amateur, mass vs. top-level, active vs. passive/spectator, men vs. women, sports vs. play (as an antithesis to organized and institutionalized activity). Following feminist or other reflexive and tradition-breaking paradigms sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the centre of various people/groups interests (connection of sports and gender, mass media, or state-politics).
The emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first social psychological experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides cultural anthropology and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in a more general way was Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens or Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class.Lueschen, G. 1980. Sociology of Sport: Development, Present State, and Prospects. Annual Review of Sociology, 6: 315 — 347. In 1970, sports sociology gained significant attention as an organized, legitimate field of study.  The North American Society for the Sociology of Sport was formed in 1978 with the objective of studying the field.  Its research outlet, the Sociology of Sport Journal, was formed in 1984.
Today, most sports sociologists identify with at least one of four essential theories that define the relationship between sports and society, namely structural functionalism, conflict theory, critical theory, and symbolic interactionism.

Slow Motion Daydream is an album by Everclear that was released (in the U.S.) by Capitol Records on March 11, 2003 (see 2003 in music). Recorded in 2002.  The first single released to radio from Slow Motion Daydream was "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom", followed by second single "The New York Times".
Though the album debuted better than the band's last album at 33 on the Billboard charts, the album quickly fell off the charts due to lack of promotion by Capitol Records and a dwindling fan base.  The album has sold only 100,000 copies to date.
This was the last album of new material to feature longtime members Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund who left the band later in August of that year.

CATEGORIES: Parts of speech

In linguistics, modal particles are always uninflected words, and are a type of grammatical particle. Their function is that of reflecting the mood or attitude of the speaker or narrator, in that they are not reflexive but change the mood of the verb. They are often used to indicate how the speaker thinks that the content of the sentence relates to the participants' common knowledge.Fabian Bross (2012): German modal particles and the common ground.

Troy weight is a system of units of mass customarily used for precious metals and gemstones.
There are 12 troy ounces per troy pound, rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common avoirdupois system. The troy ounce is 480 grains, compared with the avoirdupois ounce, which is 437½ grains. Both systems use the same grain defined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 as exactly 0.06479891 gram.NIST General Tables of Units of Measurement. United States government. Although troy ounces are still used to weigh gold, silver, and gemstones, troy weight is no longer used in most other applications.

[[Rounding]]
CATEGORIES: Arithmetic, Computer arithmetic, Theory of computation

Rounding a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit representation; for example, replacing £23.4476 with £23.45, or the fraction 312/937 with 1/3, or the expression √2 with 1.414.
Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about 123,500."
On the other hand, rounding introduces some round-off error in the result.  Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations — especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits.  In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain ill-conditioned cases they may make the result meaningless.
Accurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "the table-maker's dilemma".
Rounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.
A wavy equals sign (≈) is sometimes used to indicate rounding. For example: 9.98 ≈ 10.

[[Grain (unit)]]

CATEGORIES: Units of mass, Imperial units, Customary units of measurement in the United States, Ammunition

A grain is a unit of measurement of mass equal to 64.79891 milligrams. It is nominally based upon the mass of a single seed of a cereal. From the Bronze Age into the Renaissance the average masses of wheat and barley grains were part of the legal definition of units of mass. However, there is no evidence of any country ever having used actual seeds or cereal grains. Rather, expressions such as "thirty-two grains of wheat, taken from the middle of the ear" appear to have been ritualistic formulas, essentially the premodern equivalent of legal boilerplate.[tpl]cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Daniel McLean|last2=Scarre|first2=Christopher|authorlink2=Chris Scarre|title=The origins of metrology: collected papers of Dr. Daniel McLean McDonald|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8ujaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2012|year=1992|publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research[/tpl][tpl]rp|27[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=R.

The origin of Kollam Era has been dated to 825 AD, when the great convention in Kollam was held at the behest of King Kulashekhara. Kollam was an important town in that period, and the Malayalam Era is called 'Kolla Varsham,' possibly as a result of the Tarish-a-palli sassnam. It also signified the independence of Malabar from the Cheraman Perumals. King Kulashekhara granted the copper plate grants in 849 AD to Mar S(abo)r Iso whom he invited to Kollam from Assyria (present Persia & Syria) with Constantinople as the spiritual seat (the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire), and transferring to the Tarasa Church and Vaishnavite Nambuthiri community at Devalokakara (Thevalakara-(Tarsish)) in Quilon, lands near the city with hereditament of low caste.

The Prix de Rome ([tpl]IPA-fr|pʁi də ʁɔm|pron[/tpl]) was a scholarship for arts students. It was created, initially for painters and sculptors, in 1663 in France during the reign of Louis XIV. It was an annual bursary for promising artists having proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), was open to their students. From 1666, the award winner could win a stay of three to five years at the Palazzo Mancini in Rome at the expense of the King of France. In 1720, the Académie Royale d’Architecture began a prize in architecture. Six painters, four sculptors, and two architectsLee, S. "Prix de Rome", Grove Dictionary of Art online would be sent to the French Academy in Rome founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert from 1666.
Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as two categories: painting and sculpture.  Architecture was added in 1720.  In 1803, music was added, and after 1804 there was a prix for engraving as well. The primary winner took the "First Grand Prize" (called the agréé)Clarke, Michael. The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms, Oxford University Press, 2001 and the "Second Prizes" were awarded to the runners-up.
In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte moved the French Academy in Rome to the Villa Medici with the intention of preserving an institution once threatened by the French Revolution. At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state, and they had to be renovated in order to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. In this way, he hoped to retain for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of antiquity and the Renaissance.
Jacques-Louis David, having failed to win the prize three years in a row, considered suicide. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Ernest Chausson and Maurice Ravel attempted the Prix de Rome, but did not gain recognition.  Ravel tried a total of five times to win the prize, and the last failed attempt in 1905 was so controversial that it led to a complete reorganization of the administration at the Paris Conservatory.
The Prix de Rome was suppressed in 1968 by André Malraux, who was Minister of Culture at the time. Since then, a number of contests have been created, and the academies, together with the Institut de France, were merged by the State and the Minister of Culture. Selected residents now have an opportunity for study during an 18-month (sometimes 2-year) stay at The Academy of France in Rome, which is accommodated in the Villa Medici.
The heyday of the Prix de Rome was during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.Lee, ibid It was later imitated by the Prix Abd-el-Tif and the Villa Abd-el-Tif in Algiers, 1907–1961, and later Prix d'Indochine including a bursary to visit the École des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine in Hanoi, 1920–1939, and bursary for residence at the Casa de Velázquez in Madrid, 1929–present.

Since 1985, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and 16 of these were number one hits. Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album Storms of Life, which sold more than four million copies. The album established him as a major force in the Neotraditional country movement. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. Travis is well known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/randytravis.html|title=Biography of Country Singer Randy Travis|accessdate=February 8, 2014[/tpl]

In addition to his singing career, Travis pursued an acting career, appearing in numerous films and television series, including The Rainmaker (1997) with Matt Damon, Black Dog (1998) with Patrick Swayze, Texas Rangers (2001) with James Van Der Beek, and seven episodes of the Touched by an Angel television series.

Early Mormonism had a range of doctrines related to race in regard to black people of African descent. References to black people, their social condition during the 19th century, and their spiritual place in Western Christianity as well as Mormon scriptures were complicated.
From the beginning, black people have been members of Mormon congregations, though there were varying degrees and forms of discrimination against blacks.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] When the Mormons migrated to Missouri they encountered the pro-slavery sentiments of their neighbors.

[[GHZ experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum measurement

GHZ experiments are a class of physics experiments that may be used to generate starkly contrasting predictions from local hidden variable theory and quantum mechanical theory, and permit immediate comparison with actual experimental results.  A GHZ experiment is similar to a test of Bell's inequality, except using three or more entangled particles, rather than two.  With specific settings of GHZ experiments, it is possible to demonstrate absolute contradictions between the predictions of local hidden variable theory and those of quantum mechanics, whereas tests of Bell's inequality only demonstrate contradictions of a statistical nature.  The results of actual GHZ experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics.
The GHZ experiments are named for Daniel M. Greenberger, Michael A. Horne, and Anton Zeilinger (GHZ) who first analyzed certain measurements involving four observers.[tpl]cite journal |author=D.

In addition, he wrote stories set in his native Germany, in China and in South America. May also wrote poetry, a play, and composed music; he was a proficient player of several musical instruments. Many of his works were filmed, adapted for the stage, turned into audio dramas or into comics. A highly imaginative and fanciful writer, May never visited the exotic places featured in his stories until late in life, at which point the clash between his fiction and reality led to a complete change in his work.

CATEGORIES: 1965 births, Living people, People from Seattle, Washington, American rock guitarists, The Presidents of the United States of America (band) members, The Minus 5 members

Christopher "Chris" Ballew (born May 28, 1965) is a member of the alternative rock group The Presidents of the United States of America and performs as a children's artist under the pseudonym Caspar Babypants.
Ballew grew up in Seattle and attended middle and high school at The Bush School, where he met David Dederer, with whom he would form The Presidents of the United States of America many years later. In the late 1980s and early 90s Ballew lived in Boston, where he performed as a street musician in a duo called Egg with Phil Franklin (later of Caroliner Rainbow and Sunburned Hand of the Man).Chris Ballew Bandography, accessed August 19, 2010. When Ballew loved in Los Angeles in the 90s he shared an apartment with alternitive artist Beck. Many of Ballew's songs with Egg would become well-known Presidents songs, most notably Naked and Famous, which is performed by Egg as a bonus track on a 2005 reissue of the Presidents' eponymous debut album. While in Boston, Ballew played briefly with Mary Lou Lord, and also with Mark Sandman of Treat Her Right and Morphine in a duo called Supergroup, in which they developed the oddly stringed instruments that would become a staple of both the Presidents' and Morphine's sound.
Ballew is endorsed by Epiphone Guitars and Hartke amps, utilising an Epiphone SG-400 guitar (converted into a two-string "basitar") as well as a 3500 bass amplilfier from Hartke. No distortion pedals are used live, just the natural distortion of the amp is heard. Says Ballew, "I have a Hartke amp, a 3500 which has a really snappy, upfront, punchy sound and distorts nicely. It has a nice gain structure in it and a multi-band EQ which I love too".
Regarding his two-string "basitar", Ballew admits: "I’m technically not really a bass player, although, I play as if I’m playing bass lines, a lot of times I strum like (on a) guitar and make chords.
In 2009, Ballew launched a project targeted toward toddlers called Caspar Babypants. Ballew uses a three-string acoustic guitar when performing Caspar Babypants songs. To date, Caspar Babypants has released seven full-length albums; Here I Am!, More Please!, This Is Fun!, Sing Along!, Hot Dog!, I Found You!, and Baby Beatles!
Ballew also was a member of Beck's live band for a period of time in the early 90s, stating the gig "was the beginning of my professional career as a guy getting paid to make music." 
Ballew is married to collage artist Kate Endle.

[[Moonraker (novel)]]

CATEGORIES: 1955 novels, James Bond books, Novels by Ian Fleming, Moonraker (film), British novels adapted into films, Jonathan Cape books

Moonraker is the third novel by British author Ian Fleming featuring the fictional British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond. The book was first published by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955, bearing a cover based on Fleming's own concept. Set completely in England, the story has two halves: the first concerns a battle over a game of bridge in London's clubland between Bond and industrialist Sir Hugo Drax, while the second follows Bond's mission to stop Drax from destroying London with a nuclear weapon. The book played on a number of fears of the 1950s, including the V-2 rocket, the re-emergence of Nazism, the menace of Soviet communism and the 'threat from within'.
There have been a number of adaptations of Moonraker, including a broadcast on South African radio in 1956 starring Bob Holness and a comic strip that appeared in the Daily Express in 1958. The novel's name was also used in 1979 for the eleventh official film in the Eon Productions Bond franchise and the fourth to star Roger Moore as James Bond. However, the story for the film was significantly changed from the novel so as to include excursions into space.

A-ha (stylized a''-h''a; [tpl]IPA-no|ˈɑːhɑ[/tpl]) was a Norwegian band formed in Oslo in 1982. The band was founded by Morten Harket (vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards) and Pål Waaktaar (guitars). The group initially rose to fame during the mid-1980s after being discovered by musician and producer John Ratcliff, and had continued global success in the 1990s and 2000s.
A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album, Hunting High and Low, in 1985.

The Lordship of Ireland ([tpl]lang-ga| Tiarnas na hÉireann[/tpl]) was a period of feudal rule in Ireland between 1177 and 1542 under the King of England, styled as Lord of Ireland. The lordship was created as a Papal possession following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169–71. As the Lord of Ireland was also King of England, he was represented locally by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
Ostensibly, the lordship extended throughout all of Ireland. However, in reality, the king's rule only ever extended to parts of the island. Areas under English rule expanded and retreated over time. Many areas remained separate and outside English rule until the 16th century.
The fluid political situation and feudal system allowed a significant amount of practical autonomy for the Hiberno-Norman nobility, who carved earldoms out for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings. The period was brought to a close by the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542.

A four-stroke engine (also known as four-cycle) is an internal combustion engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes which comprise a single thermodynamic cycle. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction.

[[Numerical integration]]
CATEGORIES: Numerical analysis, Numerical integration (quadrature), Articles with example Python code

In numerical analysis, numerical integration constitutes a broad family of algorithms for calculating the numerical value of a definite integral, and by extension, the term is also sometimes used to describe the numerical solution of differential equations. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more or less a synonym for numerical integration, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Numerical integration over more than one dimension is sometimes described as cubature,[tpl]MathWorld | urlname=Cubature | title=Cubature [/tpl] although the meaning of quadrature is understood for higher-dimensional integration as well.
The basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral
to a given degree of accuracy. If [tpl]math|f(x)[/tpl] is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, and the domain of integration is bounded, there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.

James Bradley FRS (March 1693 – 13 July 1762) was an English astronomer and served as Astronomer Royal from 1742, succeeding Edmund Halley. He is best known for two fundamental discoveries in astronomy, the aberration of light (1725–1728), and the nutation of the Earth's axis (1728–1748).  These discoveries were called "the most brilliant and useful of the century" by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, historian of astronomy, mathematical astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, in his history of astronomy in the 18th century (1821), because "It is to these two discoveries by Bradley that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy. .... This double service assures to their discoverer the most distinguished place (after Hipparchus and Kepler) above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all countries."Histoire de l'astronomie au dix-huitième siècle, p. 413 (edited by Claude-Louis Mathieu, and published by Bachelier, Paris, 1827).

The Rugby Championship is an international rugby union competition contested annually by Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Prior to the 2012 tournament, when Argentina joined, it was known as the Tri Nations. The competition is administered by SANZAR, a consortium formed by three national governing bodies; the Australian Rugby Union, the New Zealand Rugby Union and the South African Rugby Union.
The inaugural Tri Nations tournament was in 1996, and was won by New Zealand – known as the All Blacks. South Africa won their first title in 1998, and Australia their first in 2000. Following the last Tri Nations tournament in 2011, New Zealand had won ten championships, with South Africa and Australia on three titles each. The first Rugby Championship was won by New Zealand, who won all six of their matches.
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have frequently been ranked among the top rugby nations, and have each won the Rugby World Cup twice. While historically weaker than the other three nations, Argentina has been ranked as high as third in the IRB World Rankings. In their first tournament in 2012, Argentina secured a 16–16 draw with South Africa in only their second game.

CATEGORIES: Data collection, Evaluation, Epidemiology, Econometrics, Experiments, Observational study

A natural experiment is an empirical study in which individuals (or clusters of individuals) exposed to the experimental and control conditions are determined by nature or by other factors outside the control of the investigators, yet the process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment. Natural experiments are most useful when there has been a clearly defined exposure involving a well defined subpopulation (and the absence of exposure in a similar subpopulation) such that changes in outcomes may be plausibly attributed to the exposure.[tpl]cite book|last=DiNardo|first=J.|authorlink=|chapter=Natural experiments and quasi-natural experiments|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|editor1-first=Steven N.|editor1-last=Durlauf|editor2-link=Steven N.

Natural experiments are employed as study designs when controlled experimentation is extremely difficult to implement or unethical, such as in several research areas addressed by epidemiology (e.g., evaluating the health impact of varying degrees of exposure to ionizing radiation in people living near Hiroshima at the time of the atomic blastFriedman, G.D.

[[Fermi energy]]

CATEGORIES: Condensed matter physics, Fermi–Dirac statistics

The Fermi energy is a concept in quantum mechanics usually referring to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states, in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature.
In a Fermi gas the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero kinetic energy, whereas in a metal the lowest occupied state is typically taken to mean the bottom of the conduction band.
Confusingly, the term "Fermi energy" is often used to refer to a different but closely related concept, the Fermi level (also called electrochemical potential).The use of the term "Fermi energy" as synonymous with Fermi level (a.k.a. electrochemical potential) is widespread in semiconductor physics. For example: Electronics (fundamentals And Applications) by D. Chattopadhyay, Semiconductor Physics and Applications by Balkanski and Wallis.
There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy, at least as they are used in this article:
Since the Fermi level in a metal at absolute zero is the energy of the highest occupied single particle state,
then the Fermi energy in a metal is the energy difference between the Fermi level and lowest occupied single-particle state, at zero-temperature.

[[Protocol (object-oriented programming)]]
CATEGORIES: Object-oriented programming

In object-oriented programming, a protocol or interface is a common means for unrelated objects to communicate with each other. These are definitions of methods and values which the objects agree upon in order to cooperate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/objectivec/chapters/ocProtocols.html|title=The Objective-C programming Language:Protocols|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=7 October 2012[/tpl]
For example, in Java (where protocols are termed interfaces), the Comparable interface specifies a method compareTo() which implementing classes should implement. This means that a separate sorting method, for example, can sort any object which implements the Comparable interface, without having to know anything about the inner nature of the class (except that two of these objects can be compared by means of compareTo()).
The protocol is a description of:
If the objects are fully encapsulated then the protocol will describe the only way in which objects may be accessed by other objects.
Some programming languages directly support protocols or interfaces (Ada, C#, D, Dart, Delphi, Java, Logtalk, Object Pascal, Objective-C, PHP, Racket, Seed7).  Older languages may also have features that can support the interface concept, such as abstract base classes with pure virtual functions  in C++, or object-oriented features in Perl.
Although the Go programming language is not generally considered an object-oriented language, it does allow methods to be defined on user-defined types. Go has "interface" types that are compatible with any type that supports a given set of methods (the type does not need to explicitly implement the interface). The empty interface, interface{}, is compatible with all types.
Note that functional programming and distributed programming languages have a concept which is also called a protocol, but whose meaning is subtly different (i.e. a specification of allowed exchanges of messages, emphasis on exchanges, not on messages). This difference is due to somewhat different assumptions of functional programming and object-oriented programming paradigms. In particular, the following are also considered as part of a protocol in these languages:

[[Parabolic microphone]]

CATEGORIES: Microphones, Surveillance, Covert listening devices

thumb|right|Parabolic microphone used at an American college football game. A parabolic microphone is a microphone that uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a receiver, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g., satellite dish) does with radio waves.  Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many metres away, include nature recording, field audio for sports broadcasting, eavesdropping (for example, espionage), and law enforcement.
Parabolic microphones are generally not used for standard recording applications because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.  This is a direct result of the physical laws that govern sound waves.
Parabolas only focus waves with a wavelength much smaller than the diameter of the parabola.
Since sound waves travel at 342 m/s through the air (speed of sound), obtaining hi-fidelity sound (down to 20 Hz, the lower limit of human hearing)
would require a parabola with a diameter greater than 17 metres (= 342 m/s / 20 Hz). Most parabolic microphones sacrifice low-end fidelity to get a more manageable size.

The Dam Busters (1955) is a British Second World War war film starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd and directed by Michael Anderson. The film recreates the true story of Operation Chastise when in 1943 the RAF's 617 Squadron attacked the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams in Germany with Barnes Wallis's "bouncing bomb".
The film was based on the books The Dam Busters (1951) by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead (1946) by Guy Gibson. The film's reflective last minutes convey the poignant mix of emotions felt by the characters – triumph over striking a successful blow against the enemy's industrial base is greatly tempered by the sobering knowledge that many died in the process of delivering it.

Rabbits are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in Australia causing millions of dollars of damage to crops. Rabbits were introduced to Australia in the 18th century with the First Fleet and became widespread after an outbreak caused by an 1859 release. Various methods in the 20th century have been attempted to control the population. Conventional methods include shooting rabbits and destroying their warrens, but these had only limited success. In 1907, a rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia in an unsuccessful attempt to contain the rabbits. The myxoma virus, which causes myxomatosis, was introduced into the rabbit population in the 1950s and had the effect of severely reducing the rabbit population.

[[Concerto grosso]]

CATEGORIES: Concerti grossi, Concertos, Italian words and phrases

The concerto grosso (Italian for big concert(o), plural concerti grossi) is a form of baroque music in which the musical material is passed between a small group of soloists (the concertino) and full orchestra (the ripieno or tutti). This is in contrast to the concerto which features a single solo instrument with the melody line, accompanied by the orchestra. 
The form developed in the late seventeenth century, although the name was not used at first. Alessandro Stradella seems to have written the first music in which two groups of different sizes are combined in the characteristic way. The name was first used by Giovanni Lorenzo Gregori in a set of 10 compositions published in Lucca in 1698.Treccani Dizionario Biografico
The first major composer to use the term concerto grosso was Arcangelo Corelli. After Corelli's death, a collection of twelve of his concerti grossi was published; not long after, composers such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli and Giuseppe Torelli wrote concertos in the style of Corelli. He also had a strong influence on Antonio Vivaldi.
Two distinct forms of the concerto grosso exist: the concerto da chiesa (church concert) and the concerto da camera (chamber concert).  (See also Sonata for a discussion about sonatas da camera and da chiesa.) The concerto da chiesa alternated slow and fast movements; the concerto da camera had the character of a suite, being introduced by a prelude and incorporating popular dance forms. These distinctions blurred over time.
Corelli's concertino group  was invariably two violins and a cello, with a string section as ripieno group. Both were accompanied by a basso continuo with some combination of harpsichord, organ, lute or theorbo.
Handel wrote several collections of concerti grossi, and several of the Brandenburg Concertos by Bach also loosely follow the concerto grosso form.
The concerto grosso form was superseded by the solo concerto and the sinfonia concertante in the late eighteenth century, and new examples of the form did not appear for more than a century. In the twentieth century, the concerto grosso has been used by composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Ernest Bloch, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Bohuslav Martinů, Malcolm Williamson, Henry Cowell, Alfred Schnittke, William Bolcom, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Andrei Eshpai, Eino Tamberg, Krzysztof Penderecki, Jean Françaix and Philip Glass. While Edward Elgar may not be considered a modern composer, his romantic Introduction and Allegro strongly resembled the instrumentation setup of a concerto grosso.

With the teeth aligned to electromagnet 1, they will be slightly offset from right electromagnet (2).
 Frame 2: The top electromagnet (1) is turned off, and the right electromagnet (2) is energized, pulling the teeth into alignment with it. This results in a rotation of 3.6° in this example.
 Frame 3: The bottom electromagnet (3) is energized; another 3.6° rotation occurs.
 Frame 4: The left electromagnet (4) is energized, rotating again by 3.6°. When the top electromagnet (1) is again enabled, the rotor will have rotated by one tooth position; since there are 25 teeth, it will take 100 steps to make a full rotation in this example.]]
A stepper motor (or step motor) is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any feedback sensor (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application.
Switched reluctance motors are very large stepping motors with a reduced pole count, and generally are closed-loop commutated.

It was pioneered by Dutch football club Ajax from 1969 to 1973, and further used by the Netherlands National Football Team in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. It was invented by Rinus Michels, who was the coach of both Ajax and the Netherlands national team at the time.
In Total Football, a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus retaining the team's intended organisational structure. In this fluid system, no outfield player is fixed in a nominal role; anyone can successively play an attacker, a midfielder and a defender.  The only player fixed in a nominal position is the goalkeeper.
Total Football's tactical success depends largely on the adaptability of each footballer within the team, in particular the ability to quickly switch positions depending on the on-field situation. The theory requires players to be comfortable in multiple positions; hence, it places high technical and physical demands on them.
During this era Ajax played some of their finest football ever, achieving home wins (46–0–0) for two full seasons (1971–72 and 1972–73), just one defeat in the whole of the 1971–72 season, and celebrating five titles in 1972 (the Netherlands national league, KNVB Cup, European Cup, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup).

[[Ohana]]
CATEGORIES: Hawaii culture, Hawaiian words and phrases

Part of Hawaiian culture, [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana means family (in an extended sense of the term, including blood-related, adoptive or intentional). The concept emphasizes that families are bound together and members must cooperate and remember one another. The term is cognate with (and its usage is similar to) the New Zealand Māori term whānau.
In current Hawaiian culture the term [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana is strictly used for blood relations.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]  Non-familial groupings always instead use the word "hui".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In Hawaiian, the word [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana begins with an ʻokina, indicating a glottal stop.
The root word [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohā refers to the root or corm of the kalo, or taro plant (the staple "staff of life" in Hawaii), which Kanaka Maoli consider to be their cosmological ancestor.
In contemporary Hawaiian economic and regulatory practice, an "[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana unit" is a part of a house or a separate structure on the same lot that may contain a relative but which may not be rented to the general public.http://www.takitaniconstruction.com/ohanazoning.html, honoluludpp.org/downloadpdf/zoning/lupdfaqs.pdf, www.honoluludpp.org/downloadpdf/construction/ohana.pdf
Ohana is a key theme in Disney's 2002 film, Lilo & Stitch and the succeeding television series based on the film.

In mathematics, ordinate most often refers to that element of an ordered pair which is plotted on the vertical axis of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, as opposed to the abscissa. The term can also refer to the vertical axis (typically y-axis) of a two-dimensional graph (because that axis is used to define and measure the vertical coordinates of points in the space). An ordered pair consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually x) and the ordinate (vertical, usually y)—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space.[tpl]cite web | last = Weisstein | first = Eric W. | title = Ordinate | work = MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ordinate.html | accessdate = 14 July 2013[/tpl]

It was initially composed of several Italian political parties:
The alliance won the 1994 Italian general election under the name Pole of Freedoms, but the resulting government was short-lived, as Lega Nord withdrew their support and went to opposition. Particularly unstable had been the relationship within the federalist Lega Nord movement and the conservative, pro-central government National Alliance. As such, the first Berlusconi government lasted only nine months.
After a five-year centre-left government, Berlusconi managed to keep at bay some of the most uncompromising Lega Nord proposals and won the 2001 general election, this time with a view to create a stable government. It sought to undermine the proportionality rules of the Italian Additional Member System of elections by running many of its constituency candidates under a decoy list called Abolizione Scorporo, a title which explicitly stated its opposition to the counting rules; its tactic largely worked because it had more support than the centre-left alliance United in the Olive Tree.
In 2003 House of Freedoms was routed in local elections by the Olive Tree alliance, and the League threatened to pull out of the House of Freedoms. In 2005, once again, House of Freedoms was severely routed in regional elections, losing six of eight Italian regions. This led to a crisis of the government, particularly after the UDC pulled its four ministers out. A few weeks later, a new government was formed on the 23 April 2005 with the same six parties (FI, AN, LN, UDC, NPSI, PRI) and a minor Cabinet reshuffle, creating the Berlusconi III Cabinet.

The Kirtland Safety Society (KSS) was first proposed as a bank in 1836, and eventually organized on January 2, 1837, as a joint stock company, by leaders and followers of the Church of the Latter Day Saints.  According to KSS's 1837 "Articles of Agreement", it was intended to serve the financial needs of the growing Mormon community in Kirtland, Ohio. Its preamble stated it was:
However, by November 1837, KSS failed and its business closed.  In the aftermath, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was sued by enemies of the Safety Society for "running an illegal bank," though he was employed as the institution's Cashier. While Smith appealed the fine and made arrangements to have Oliver Granger settle the affairs of the quasi-bank, many bankrupted Mormons left the church because they believed Smith had established the bank in order to enrich himself and the Mormon leadership.Adams, Chartering the Kirtland Bank.

[[Case-based reasoning]]

CATEGORIES: Classification algorithms, Critical thinking, Inductive reasoning, Reasoning

Case-based reasoning (CBR), broadly construed, is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems. An auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning.  A lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning.  So, too, an engineer copying working elements of nature (practicing biomimicry), is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems. Case-based reasoning is a prominent kind of analogy making.
It has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning, but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving;  or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced. This view is related to prototype theory, which is most deeply explored in cognitive science.

A student design competition is a specific form of a student competition relating to design. Design competitions can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical competitions is to introduce students to real-world engineering situations and to teach students project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually require art and design skills.
Both students and industry benefit from intercollegiate design competitions.  Each competition allows students to apply the theories and information they have learning in the class room to real situations.  Industry gains better prepared and more experienced engineers.

[[Sauvignon blanc]]
CATEGORIES: White wine grape varieties

Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the Bordeaux region of France.  The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage ("wild") and blanc ("white") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 52 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1-56305-434-5 It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin.  Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Washington and California.  Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called "Fume Blanc".
Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and "green flavors" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risk losing a lot of aromatics from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes. Wine & Spirits Education Trust "Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality" pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, ISBN 9781905819157
Wine experts have used the phrase "crisp, elegant, and fresh" as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 268 Workman Publishing 2001 ISBN 1-56305-434-5Materman, "Stuff of legends: Marlborough Sauvignon blanc." Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly Chèvre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi.Robert Joseph and Margaret Rand, KISS Guide to Wine DK Pub 2000 ISBN 0-7894-5981-7
Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.

[[Poetry analysis]]
CATEGORIES: Poetics, Literary criticism

Poetry analysis is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work.
The words poem and poetry derive from the Greek poiēma (to make) and poieo (to create). That is, a poem is a made thing: a creation; an artefact. One might think of a poem as, in the words of William Carlos Williams, a "machine made of words". Machines produce some effect, or do some work. They do whatever they are designed to do. The work done by this "machine made of words" is the effect it produces in the reader's mind. A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works.
Like poetry itself, poetry analysis can take many forms, and be undertaken for many different reasons. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to his or her students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen his or her own mastery. A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem.

thumb|Dunes near Ica, Peru'''
Desert climate (in the Köppen climate classification BWh and BWk, sometimes also BWn), also known as an arid climate, is a climate that does not meet the criteria to be classified as a polar climate, and in which precipitation is too low to sustain any vegetation at all, or at most a very scanty scrub. 
An area that features this climate usually experiences less than 250 mm (10 inches) per year of precipitation and in some years may experience no precipitation at all. In some instances, an area may experience more than 250 mm of precipitation annually, but is considered a desert climate because the region loses more water via evapotranspiration than falls as precipitation (Tucson, Arizona and Alice Springs, Northern Territory are examples of this). 
There are usually two or three variations of a desert climate: a hot desert climate (BWh), a cold desert climate (BWk) and, sometimes, a mild desert climate (BWh/BWn). Furthermore, to delineate "hot desert climates" from "cold desert climates", there are three widely used isotherms: either a mean annual temperature of 18°C, or a mean temperature of 0°C or -3°C in the coldest month, so that a location with a "BW" type climate with the appropriate temperature above whichever isotherm is being used is classified as "hot arid" (BWh), and a location with the appropriate temperature below the given isotherm is classified as "cold arid" (BWk).
To determine whether a location has an arid climate, the precipitation threshold must first be determined. Finding the precipitation threshold (in millimetres) involves first multiplying the average annual temperature in °C by 20, then adding 280 if 70% or more of the total precipitation is in the high-sun half of the year (April through September in the Northern Hemisphere, or October through March in the Southern), or 140 if 30%–70% of the total precipitation is received during the applicable period, or 0 if less than 30% of the total precipitation is so received. If the area's annual precipitation is less than half the threshold, it is classified as a BW (desert climate).

[[Gauss–Markov theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical theorems

In statistics, the Gauss–Markov theorem, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov, states that in a linear regression model in which the errors have expectation zero and are uncorrelated and have equal variances, the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the coefficients is given by the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator.  Here "best" means giving the lowest variance of the estimate, as compared to other unbiased, linear estimates. The errors don't need to be normal, nor do they need to be independent and identically distributed (only uncorrelated and homoscedastic). The hypothesis that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since otherwise estimators better than OLS exist. See for examples the James–Stein estimator (which also drops linearity) or ridge regression.

[[Sprite comic]]
CATEGORIES: Sprite webcomics

Sprite comics are webcomics that use computer sprites, often taken from video games, for significant portions of their artwork.  There are also animated sprite comics (called sprite cartoons) where each "strip" is a separate mini-movie, animated using technologies such as Flash.
The comic Neglected Mario Characters is generally considered the first sprite comic to appear on the web.Will Strip for Games, 1UP.com It began as a spin-off feature from the Super Mario fansite Super Mario Headquarters.
The first sprite comic to gain widespread popularity was Bob and George, which played a substantial role in the sudden popularity of sprite comics.  It is often mistakenly identified as the first sprite comic.  The strip utilizes sprites from the Mega Man series of games, with most of the characters being taken directly from the games.  Due to the popularity of the comic, many of its features have been frequently emulated by other sprite comics, and thus are often labeled as cliché.  Such features include having extremely stupid characters, a character representing the author, and making fun of the strip itself.
Sprite comics frequently use characters from well-known games such as Sonic, Super Mario Bros., Final Fantasy, Mortal Kombat, Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Mega Man, and Dragon Ball.  Some sprite comics use sprites from several different games.  In addition to or instead of video game sprites, some comics use original sprites created specifically for the comic.
Sprite comics have become very popular in large part due to the ease of creating a sprite comic, since minimal artistic skill is required. Sprites can easily be ripped from game ROMs using an emulator, or by using sprites from websites that collect sprites for public use.  Comics can then be created using a simple image editor. Video game sprites are often designed to be animated, and thus often provide a wide variety of character poses, as well as being easily editable due to their simple design. Sprite comics also give the author the opportunity to parody the game from which the sprites are derived using the game's actual characters.

[[Normal matrix]]

CATEGORIES: Matrices

In mathematics, a complex square matrix A is normal if
where A* is the conjugate transpose of A. That is, a matrix is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose.
A matrix A with real entries satisfies A*=AT, and is therefore normal if ATA = AAT.
Normality is a convenient test for diagonalizability: a matrix is normal if and only if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, and therefore any matrix A satisfying the equation A*A=AA* is diagonalizable.
The concept of normal matrices can be extended to normal operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and to normal elements in C*-algebras. As in the matrix case, normality means commutativity is preserved, to the extent possible, in the noncommutative setting. This makes normal operators, and normal elements of C*-algebras, more amenable to analysis.

[[Copal]]

CATEGORIES: Art materials, Fossil resins, Incense material, Mesoamerican society, Natural history of Mesoamerica, Resins

Copal is a name given to tree resin that is particularly identified with the aromatic resins used by the cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica as ceremonially burned incense and other purposes.Stross (1997). More generally, the term copal describes resinous substances in an intermediate stage of polymerization and hardening between "gummier" resins and amber.Platt (1998).
The word copal is derived from the Nahuatl language word [tpl]lang|nah-Latn|copalli[/tpl], meaning "incense".[ref]"The word 'copal' first appeared in the English language in 1577. John Frampton wrote in his 'Englished' edition of Nicolas Monardes' Dos libros, el veno que trata de todas las cosas que traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales, originally published in 1596(Monardes 1577): 'They doe bring from the Newe Spaine Mexico twoo kindes of Rosine... the one is called Copall.'
"Over three centuries later, Walter Hough (1912) wrote: 'There is a great confusion as to the identity of copal, the name, according to some writers, being used to cover a number of gums. It is possible that the confusion has arisen from post conquest times when errors multiplied rapidly as Mexican culture slipped swiftly into the background, for the earliest reliable chroniclers are clear as to the commonest use of the gum which we know as copal, and whose characteristic odor would place it distinctly in the first rank of incense materials.'

"... This agrees with the etymology of the word 'copal' from the Nahuatl copalli, literally 'with the help of this path' or 'thanks to this path' (Corzo 1978).

"Pom is derived from the Mayan po-, a root word meaning 'in harmony with the action of fire,' and -om, a suffix which denotes 'activity,' literally 'that that which is to be burnt' (Barrera Marín, Barrera Vásquez Vázquez, and López Franco 1976)."  —

To the pre-Columbian Maya and contemporary Maya peoples it is known in the various Mayan languages as [tpl]lang|myi-Latn|pom[/tpl] (or a close variation thereof), although the word itself has been demonstrated to be a loanword to Mayan from Mixe–Zoquean languages.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Copal is still used by a number of  indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America as an incense and during sweat lodge ceremonies.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/stross/papers/copal.htm|title=Mesoamerican Copal Resins[/tpl] It is available in different forms. The hard, amber-like yellow copal is a less expensive version. The white copal, a hard, milky, sticky substance, is a more expensive version of the same resin.
Copal was also found in East Africa (the common species there being Hymenaea verrucosa), initially feeding an Indian Ocean demand for incense. By the 18th century, Europeans found it to be a valuable ingredient in making a good wood varnish. It became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and carriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish.Mayer, Ralph (1976). The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. New York: Viking. pp. 194–196 By the late 19th and early 20th century varnish manufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly swelling its demand.
In 1859 Americans consumed 68 percent of the East African trade, which was controlled through the Sultan of Zanzibar, with Germany receiving 24 percent. The American Civil War and the creation of the Suez Canal led to Germany, India and Hong Kong taking the majority by the end of that century.Thaddeus Sunseri, Wielding the Ax: State Forestry and Social Conflict in Tanzania, 1820-2000, 2009, p 10-12
East Africa apparently had a higher amount of subfossil copal, which is found one or two meters below living copal trees from roots of trees that may have lived thousands of years earlier. This subfossil copal produces a harder varnish. Subfossil copal is also well-known from New Zealand (Kauri gum), Japan, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Madagascar. It often has inclusions and is sometimes sold as "young amber". Copal can be easily distinguished from genuine amber by its lighter citrine colour and its surface getting tacky with a drop of acetone or chloroform.David Grimaldi, Amber: Window to the Past, 1996, p 16-20, American Museum of Natural History

Ash Wednesday, a day of fasting, is the first day of Lent in Western Christianity. It therefore occurs 46 days before Easter and can fall as early as February 4 or as late as March 10. Ash Wednesday is observed by many Christian denominations, including Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Anglicans, and Presbyterians.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ash-wednesday-today-christians-observe-first-day-of-lent-115628/|title=Ash Wednesday Today, Christians Observe First Day of Lent|date=5 March 2014|last=Koonse|first=Emma|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=19 April 2014|quote=Although some denominations do not practice the application of ashes to the forehead as a mark of public commitment on Ash Wednesday, those that do include Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and some Baptist followers.[/tpl]

Every Sunday was seen as a commemoration of the Sunday of Christ's resurrection and so as a feast day on which fasting was inappropriate. Accordingly, Christians fasted from Monday to Saturday (6 days) during 6 weeks and from Wednesday to Saturday (4 days) in the preceding week, thus making up the number of 40 days.Scott P. Richert: How Are the 40 Days of Lent Calculated? Why Sundays don't count during Lent
Ash Wednesday derives its name from the practice of blessing ashes made from palm branches blessed on the previous year Palm Sunday, and placing them on the heads of participants to the accompaniment of the words "Repent, and believe in the Gospel" or "Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return".Roman Missal: Ash Wednesday

[[Bark]]

CATEGORIES: Plant physiology, Plant morphology

Bark is the outermost layers of stems and roots of woody plants.  Plants with bark include trees, woody vines, and shrubs. Bark refers to all the tissues outside of the vascular cambium and is a nontechnical term. It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older stems is living tissue, includes the innermost area of the periderm. The outer bark in older stems includes the dead tissue on the surface of the stems, along with parts of the innermost periderm and all the tissues on the outer side of the periderm. The outer bark on trees is also called the rhytidome.
Products used by people that are derived from bark include: bark shingle siding and wall coverings,http://barkhouse.com/ spices and other flavorings, tanbark for tannin, resin, latex, medicines, poisons, various hallucinatory chemicals and cork. Bark has been used to make cloth, canoes, and ropes and used as a surface for paintings and map making.Taylor, Luke. 1996. Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land.

[[Isotropic etching]]
CATEGORIES: Semiconductors

In semiconductor technology isotropic etching is non-directional removal of material from a substrate via a chemical process using an etchant substance.  The etchant may be a corrosive liquid or a chemically active ionized gas, known as a plasma.
Isotropic etching is most easily understood by comparison to anisotropic (or non-isotropic) etching.  The most important commercial application of anisotropic etching is in semiconductor chip processing, where photolithography is used to print resist lines on silicon wafers.  To adequately reproduce very tiny lines (below 0.1 micrometer) into underlying silicon and metal layers on a wafer held in the horizontal plane, the direction of etching must be vertical only.  The etchant may not be permitted to spread in the horizontal plane.
Isotropic etching may occur unavoidably, or it may be desirable for process reasons.

[[Market system]]

CATEGORIES: Economic systems, Markets (customer bases)

A market system is any systematic process enabling many market players to bid and ask: helping bidders and sellers interact and make deals.  It is not just the price mechanism but the entire system of regulation, qualification, credentials, reputations and clearing that surrounds that mechanism and makes it operate in a social context.[tpl]Cite book|title=Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies|author= Campbell R. McConnell, Stanley L. Brue|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0-07-281935-9[/tpl]
Because a market system relies on the assumption that players are constantly involved and unequally enabled, a market system is distinguished specifically from a voting system where candidates seek the support of voters on a less regular basis.  However, the interactions between market and voting systems are an important aspect of political economy, and some argue they are hard to differentiate, e.g. systems like cumulative voting and runoff voting involve a degree of market-like bargaining and tradeoff, rather than simple statements of choice.

[[Needlepoint]]

CATEGORIES: Embroidery

Needlepoint is a form of counted thread embroidery in which yarn is stitched through a stiff open weave canvas.   Most needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas. Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern.
The degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the thread count of the underlying mesh fabric. Needlepoint worked on fine canvas is known as petit point. Due to the inherent stiffness of needlepoint, common uses include wall hangings, pillows, upholstery, holiday ornaments, purses and eyeglass cases.

[[Caper story]]

CATEGORIES: Crime fiction, Fiction by genre

The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction.  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader.  The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.
The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr criminal talents to solve murders.
A caper may appear as a subplot in a larger work.  For example, Tom Sawyer's plot to steal Jim out of slavery in the last part of Huckleberry Finn is a classic caper.

[[Judgment notwithstanding verdict]]
CATEGORIES: Civil procedure, United States law

Judgment notwithstanding the verdict, also called judgment non obstante veredicto, or JNOV, is a type of judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) that is ordered at the conclusion of a jury trial.
JNOV is the practice in American courts whereby the presiding judge in a civil jury trial may overrule the decision of a jury and reverse or amend their verdict. In literal terms, the judge enters a verdict notwithstanding the jury findings. This intervention, often requested but rarely granted, permits the judge to exercise discretion to avoid extreme and unreasonable jury decisions.Rule 50(b). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
A judge is not allowed to enter a JNOV of "guilty" following a jury acquittal in United States criminal cases because it would violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. However, if the judge grants a motion to set aside judgment after the jury convicts, this may be reversed on appeal by the prosecution, as the verdict was different previously. 
A JNOV is appropriate only if the judge determines that no reasonable jury could have reached the given verdict. For example, if a party enters no evidence on an essential element of their case, and the jury still finds in their favor, the court may rule that no reasonable jury would have disregarded the lack of evidence on that key point and reform the judgment.
Reversal of a jury's verdict by a judge occurs when the judge believes that there were insufficient facts on which to base the jury's verdict, or that the verdict did not correctly apply the law. This procedure is similar to a situation in which a judge orders a jury to arrive at a particular verdict, called a directed verdict. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict is occasionally made when a jury refuses to follow a judge's instruction to arrive at a certain verdict.Rule 50(a). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

[[Interlibrary loan]]

CATEGORIES: Library science

Interlibrary loan (abbreviated ILL, and sometimes called interloan, interlending, document delivery, or document supply) is a service whereby a user of one library can borrow books or receive photocopies of documents that are owned by another library.  The user makes a request with their local library, which, acting as an intermediary, identifies owners of the desired item, places the request, receives the item, makes it available to the user, and arranges for its return. The lending library usually sets the due date and overdue fees of the material borrowed. Although books and journal articles are the most frequently requested items, some libraries will lend audio recordings, video recordings, maps, sheet music, and microforms of all kinds.  In many cases, nominal fees accompany interlibrary loan services.
The term document delivery may also be used for a related service, namely the supply of journal articles and other copies on a personalized basis, whether these come from other libraries or direct from publishers.  The end user is usually responsible for any fees, such as costs for postage or photocopying.  Commercial document delivery services will borrow on behalf of any customer willing to pay their rates.

[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Kiser|Cai|2003[/tpl] give 481 BC, 475 BC, and 468 BC as three other common dates selected by historians.) in the alluvial plain of the Yellow River, the Shandong Peninsula and the river valleys of the Huai and Han.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Hsu|1990|p=547[/tpl] It roughly corresponds to the first half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty.  Its name comes from the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 479 BC, which tradition associates with Confucius.  The period can also be further divided into three sub-periods:[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Pines|2002|p=2[/tpl][tpl]Harvcoltxt|Blakeley|1977|p=212[/tpl]
During the Spring and Autumn period, China's feudal system of fēngjiàn became largely irrelevant. The Zhou dynasty kings held nominal power, but had real control over only a small royal demesne centered on their capital LuoyiChinese: 洛邑. near modern-day Luoyang. During the early part of the Zhou dynasty period, royal relatives and generals had been given control over fiefdoms in an effort to maintain Zhou authority over vast territory.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Chinn|2007|p=43[/tpl] As the power of the Zhou kings waned, these fiefdoms became increasingly independent states.  
The most important feudal princes (known later as the twelve vassals) met during regular conferences where important matters, such as military expeditions against foreign groups or offending nobles, were decided. During these conferences, one vassal leader was sometimes declared hegemon ([tpl]zh|c=伯|hp=bó|links=no[/tpl]; later, [tpl]zh|c=霸|hp=bà|links=no[/tpl]) and given leadership over the armies of all Zhou states.
As the era unfolded, larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones. By the 6th century BC, most small states had disappeared and only a few large and powerful principalities dominated China. Some southern states, such as Chu and Wu, claimed independence from the Zhou. Wars were undertaken to oppose some of these states (Wu and Yue).
Amid the interstate power struggles, internal conflict was also rife: six elite landholding families waged war on each other in Jin; the Chen family was eliminating political enemies in Qi; and legitimacy of the rulers was often challenged in civil wars by various royal family members in Qin and Chu. Once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions, the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the Warring States period, which began in 403 BC when the three remaining elite families in Jin – Zhao, Wei and Han – partitioned the state.

Jacob Le Maire (c. 1585, Antwerp or Amsterdam - December 22, 1616, at sea) was a Dutch mariner who circumnavigated the earth in 1615 and 1616. The strait between Tierra del Fuego and Isla de los Estados was named the Le Maire Strait in his honor, though not without controversy. It was Le Maire himself who proposed to the council aboard Eendracht that the new passage should be called by his name and the council unanimously agreed with Le Maire.

The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, with lead singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. They were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brusheswithgreatness.net/anr/anrgreats.irev |title=Great Moments in A&R |publisher=Brusheswithgreatness.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18[/tpl] then A&R head, in 1977.
The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called a "genuine rock masterpiece" by Allmusic. The most successful and well known song from the album, "Just What I Needed", started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJs, which led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977.
The band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then, telling one interviewer in 1997 "I'm saying never and you can count on that.""Life after the Cars" The Cincinnati Post October 11, 1997: 16A Bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, The New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The surviving original members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, titled Move Like This, which was released May 10, 2011, and a tour to start on the same day.The Cars Reunite for First Album in 23 Years Billboard October 21, 2010

[[UFO conspiracy theory]]
CATEGORIES: Conspiracy theories by subject

UFO conspiracy theory argues that evidence of unidentified flying objects and extraterrestrial visitors is being suppressed by various governments around the world, most notably the United States government.
According to David Morrison, fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, such theories are backed by little or no evidence.CSI | UFOs and Aliens in Space
However, many well-credentialed people claim that there is an overarching cover-up of the subject by the U.S. Government. Former Senator Mike Gravel, claims that the White House is suppressing, ignoring and/or marginalizing evidence.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/power-players-abc-news/former-sen-mike-gravel-says-white-house-suppressing-112957111.html | title=  Out there: Former Sen.

Conspiracy believers commonly argue that Earth governments, especially the Government of the United States, are in communication and/or cooperation with extraterrestrials despite public claims to the contrary, and further that some of these theories claim that the governments are explicitly allowing alien abduction. British researchers have found some evidence of suppression of UFO incidents by governments during the Cold War but have found no evidence of it having a conspiratorial nature. The motive is attributed to the governments' desire to avoid admitting that they could not explain the UFO phenomenon and its associated hysteria.Paul Harris: Cold War hysteria sparked UFO obsession, study finds

A Flock of Seagulls (also known as Flock of Seagulls) are an English new wave band originally formed in Liverpool by brothers Michael "Mike" Score (keyboards, vocals) and Alister "Ali" James Score (drums), with Francis Lee (Frank) Maudsley (bass), and Paul Reynolds (guitar). A Flock of Seagulls were originally assimilated in the batch of new wave Liverpool acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s, led by OMD and also including The Teardrop Explodes, China Crisis, Echo and the Bunnymen and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.[tpl]cite news|title= The Electric Hills |url= http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/19/theatre1 |work= The Guardian |first= Alfred |last= Hickling |date= 19 March 2007 |accessdate= 5 November 2013[/tpl]

The band have also won a Grammy Award.
Renowned for Score's unique hairstyle – which was intended to resemble a seagull – the legacy of A Flock of Seagulls is as something of a joke band, but they have also been hailed as pioneers.

[[Majestic 12]]

CATEGORIES: Conspiracy theories in the United States, Government responses to UFOs, Roswell UFO incident, Classified documents, Forgery controversies, Hoaxes

Majestic 12 (or MJ-12) is alleged to have been the code name of a secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. The purpose of the committee was stated in the Wilbert Smith memo (see below) to have been to investigate the slew of reports of "flying saucer" sightings that were then being received by U.S. military intelligence and in particular to look into the possible physics and technology of propulsion of the aerial objects that were being reported.  The formation of the committee is, because of the timing, widely believed to have been precipitated by the recovery of a UFO north of Roswell, New Mexico during June/July 1947.
Indications of such a group's existence may have appeared in 1978 in declassified Canadian documents, though neither the term "MJ-12", nor any of its ascribed variations, was mentioned. Therefore, suggesting this Canadian document is in some way evidence of "MJ-12" is sheer speculation. The first reference to a classified group called "MJ-Twelve" was discovered in a suspicious document dated in 1980. In this first appearance of what is now commonly called "MJ-12", the name was spelled out, not abbreviated. However, this document was later identified to be a hoax[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] and attributed to United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Special Agent Richard Doty, who provided it to author William Moore for the purpose (according to Moore) of feeding disinformation to Paul Bennewitz, whom AFOSI was actively working to discredit. In 1984, a set of documents was allegedly discovered in United States archives, though under circumstances that are now considered questionable as well. These 1984 documents more closely resemble legitimate declassified documents, appearing to show more effort was made to have them appear genuine. Reportedly, the FBI later declared them to be "completely bogus".
UFO conspiracy theories and the popular media based on them sometimes incorporate Majestic 12.

[[America's Cup]]

CATEGORIES: America's Cup, Sports trophies and awards, 1851 establishments, Sailing races

The America's Cup, affectionately known as the "Auld Mug", is a trophy awarded to the winner of the America's Cup match races between two sailing yachts. One yacht, known as the defender, represents the yacht club that currently holds the America's Cup and the second yacht, known as the challenger, represents the yacht club that is challenging for the cup.  The timing of each match is determined by an agreement between the defender and the challenger. The America's Cup is the oldest international sporting trophy.[ref]

[tpl]verify credibility|date=May 2012[/tpl][/ref]
The trophy was originally awarded in 1851 by the Royal Yacht Squadron for a race around the Isle of Wight in England, which was won by the schooner America. The trophy was renamed the America's Cup after the yacht and was donated to the New York Yacht Club (NYYC) under the terms of the Deed of Gift, which made the cup available for perpetual international competition.
Any yacht club that meets the requirements specified in the Deed of Gift has the right to challenge the yacht club that holds the Cup. If the challenging club wins the match, it gains stewardship of the cup.
The history and prestige associated with the America's Cup attracts not only the world's top sailors and yacht designers but also the involvement of wealthy entrepreneurs and sponsors. It is a test not only of sailing skill and boat and sail design, but also of fund-raising and management skills.
The trophy was held by the NYYC from 1857 (when the syndicate that won the Cup donated the trophy to the club) until 1983 when the Cup was won by the Royal Perth Yacht Club, represented by the yacht Australia II, ending the longest winning streak in the history of sport.[tpl]cite book|publisher=Pelham Books|author=John Rousmaniere|title=The America's Cup 1851–1983|year=1983|isbn=978-0-7207-1503-3[/tpl]
From the first defense  of the Cup in 1870 through the twentieth defense in 1967, there was always only one challenger. In 1970, for the first time, there were multiple challengers, so the NYYC agreed that the challengers could run a selection series with the winner becoming the official challenger and competing against the defender in the America's Cup match. Since 1983, Louis Vuitton has sponsored the Louis Vuitton Cup as a prize for the winner of the challenger selection series.
Early matches for the Cup were raced between yachts [tpl]convert|65|–|90|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] on the waterline owned by wealthy sportsmen. This culminated with the J-Class regattas of the 1930s. After World War II and almost twenty years without a challenge, the NYYC made changes to the Deed of Gift to allow smaller, less expensive 12-metre class yachts to compete; this class was used until it was replaced in 1990 by the International America’s Cup Class which was used until 2007.
After a long legal battle, the 2010 America's Cup was raced in [tpl]convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] lwl multihull yachts in a best-of-three "deed-of-gift" match in Valencia, Spain. The victorious Golden Gate Yacht Club then elected to race the 34th America's Cup in AC72 foiling, wing-sail catamarans. Golden Gate Yacht Club successfully defended the Cup, making it likely that the 35th America's Cup match will be also sailed in foiling multi-hull yachts.

It has a picture of the whole family on the back and a small picture of David Cassidy and Shirley Jones.  The album cover is made to look like an old-fashioned photo album.  The original release of the album included a framed color photograph of the group. The exterior label promoting the inclusion of the hit song was affixed to the jacket itself, not the shrink wrap.
The album reached #4 in the U.S. on the Billboard album chart and #6 in neighbouring Canada on the RPM 100 national album chart.Library and Archives Canada. http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.3728&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=8flu94hkg8nkt74latvtu6ttc6 It was produced by Wes Farrell and engineered by Bob Kovach. It was arranged by Mike Melvoin, Billy Strange, Wes Farrell, and Don Peake. A few of the songs on the album feature a choral pop sound by people who were the original voices of The Partridge Family before it was discovered that David Cassidy could sing. They were John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward. Shortly after production on the first album and TV show began David Cassidy was promoted by Wes Farrell to lead singer. From that point on they provided the backup vocals for all of the Partridge Family albums, along with Shirley Jones and assorted other singers.

As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), it was produced by Wes Farrell at Western Recorders, studio 2 in Los Angeles.
Up to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter.  Cassidy penned the song "Lay It on the Line" with Wes Farrell. The song features a strong guitar track.
The album cover was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birthdates of the family (including their dog, Simone), which were the actual birthdates of the cast members. The album also included a bookcover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after its release.

[[Sound Magazine]]

CATEGORIES: The Partridge Family albums, 1971 albums, Bell Records albums, Albums produced by Wes Farrell

The Partridge Family Sound Magazine was the third album from The Partridge Family. It was released on the Bell Records label in August 1971 and, like all of the Partridge Family recordings, was produced by Wes Farrell for Coral Rock Productions. The LP was certified gold in September of that year and is near-universally regarded – by both fans and critics – as the Partridge Family's consummate pop album.
This was the first Partridge Family album featuring Brian Forster (replacing Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge) on the album cover.
The album reached #9 on the Billboard album chart, and produced the #13 hit "I Woke Up In Love This Morning". Background musicians were: Hal Blaine on drums, Mike Melvoin and Larry Knechtel on piano, and Dennis Budimir and Louie Shelton on guitar. Background voices were provided by John Bahler, Tom Bahler, Jackie Ward, and Ron Hicklin. The vocal background was arranged by John Bahler.
As with most Partridge Family releases, many well-known songwriters contributed songs to the album, including Paul Anka, Rupert Holmes, Tony Romeo and Bobby Hart. The latter had also contributed songs to The Monkees, a similar project which also combined a prime time television series about a part-fictional/part-real musical group with a series of music albums.
In addition, lead vocalist David Cassidy co-wrote "Love Is All That I Ever Needed" with producer Wes Farrell. This was his second composition to appear on a Partridge Family album.
In the mythos of Partridge Family lore, they also recorded a watered-down version of the sexy song "I'll Be Your Magician" which was ultimately discarded and never released. One other song recorded during the sessions for Sound Magazine was "Warm My Soul", which was also a leftover track, discarded because its acid-tinged gospel sound did not fit in with the album's easy listening style. A later re-worked version of the song appeared on Cassidy's second solo album Rock Me Baby.

[[Christmas card]]

CATEGORIES: Christmas traditions, Greeting cards

A Christmas card (also called holiday card in the U.S.) is a greeting card sent as part of the traditional celebration of Christmas in order to convey between people a range of sentiments related to the Christmas and holiday season. Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including non-Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads "wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year". There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer or Biblical verse; others stay away from religion with an all-inclusive "Season's greetings".
A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves.

Partridge Family lead vocalist David Cassidy wrote "There'll Come a Time" for the album, which would be his third songwriting effort to appear on a Partridge Family album. It would also be his last, as Cassidy's later songwriting efforts would all be released on his solo albums.

The album was recorded between July and September 1973 and released in October 1973.Bulletin Board review by Howard Pattow from C'mon Get Happy, The Unofficial Website of The Partridge Family. Bulletin Board was the first Partridge Family album to fail to chart on the Billboard 200 album chart.Billboard.com partridge family|chart=all}} "Looking For A Good Time" b/w "Money Money" was released as a single in November 1973 (Bell Records Catalog number: Bell 45-414), but failed to chart.

The album cover featured a hand-written track listing pinned to a bulletin board, as well as a "family" photograph and a memo detailing the show's new Saturday night time slot. According to the liner notes for the CD release, the album cover was created within only a few hours due to time constraints. While Wes Farrell is credited as producer on the album, it was, in fact, produced and arranged by John Bahler, a member of 60s pop band The Love Generation and, later, the Ron Hicklin Singers, who provided backing vocals on all the Partridge Family albums. Bulletin Board is the only Partridge Family album recorded in a studio different from the preceding albums (which had all been recorded at Western Recorders (Studio 2) Los Angeles).Partridge Family Release Dates
Reviewer Dave Thompson of Allmusic gave the album a rating of three stars out of five, claiming it was more representative of David Cassidy's solo material than the usual Partridge Family album: "the performances all lean a lot closer towards the Cassidy solo ideal -- soft ballads, tight rockers -- than the all-for-one harmonies and joy that characterized the Partridges' earlier releases." Allmusic [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r14933|pure_url=yes[/tpl] Howard Pattow, a member of the Partridge Family tribute band Sound Magazine, states that "the music here is groovy and funky, a definite reflection of pop music's embrace of disco ... overall, the music on Bulletin Board is quite different from previous Partridge Family efforts ... and features musicians that had previously not appeared on a Partridge record." 
The compact disc was reissued by Collectors' Choice Music in September 2008. Initially, the disc was available exclusively through the company's web site. The disc contains two bonus tracks, comprising both sides of the Bones Howe-produced Shirley Jones single "Ain't Love Easy / Roses in the Snow", from 1972.Amazon.com Editorial Review

Boogie-woogie is an African American style of piano-based blues that became popular in the late 1930s and early '40s, but originated much earlier, and was extended from piano, to three pianos at once, guitar, big band, and country and western music, and even gospel. While the blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing. The lyrics of one of the earliest hits, "Pinetop's Boogie Woogie", consist entirely of instructions to dancers:
It is characterized by a regular bass figure, in the left hand. The bass figure is transposed according to the chord changes.
It is not strictly a solo piano style, but is also used to accompany singers and as a solo part in bands and small combos. It is sometimes called "eight to the bar", as much of it is written in common time (4/4) time using eighth notes (quavers) (see time signature). The chord progressions are typically based on I - IV - V - I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i - IV/iv - v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones).
For the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as "Swanee River" and hymns such as "Just a Closer Walk with Thee".

[[Consumerism]]

CATEGORIES: Cultural appropriation, Economic ideologies, Social philosophy, Environmental issues, Consumerism

Consumerism is a social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-greater amounts. Early criticisms of consumerism are present in the works of Thorstein Veblen (1899).  Veblen's subject of examination, the newly emergent middle class arising at the turn of the twentieth century,[ref]
Veblen, Thorstein (1899):  The Theory of the Leisure Class: an economic study of institutions, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994, ISBN 0-486-28062-4. (also available: Project Gutenberg e-text)[/ref]
comes to fruition by the end of the twentieth century through the process of globalization.
In this sense, consumerism is usually considered a part of media culture.
The term "consumerism" has also been used to refer to something quite different called the consumerists movement, consumer protection or consumer activism, which seeks to protect and inform consumers by requiring such practices as honest packaging and advertising, product guarantees, and improved safety standards. In this sense it is a movement or a set of policies aimed at regulating the products, services, methods, and standards of manufacturers, sellers, and advertisers in the interests of the buyer.consumerism, answers.com
In economics, consumerism refers to economic policies placing emphasis on consumption. In an abstract sense, it is the consideration that the free choice of consumers should strongly orient the choice of what is produced and how, and therefore orient the economic organization of a society (compare producerism, especially in the British sense of the term)."Consumerism". Britannica Concise Encyclopedia Online. 2008. Also this vote is not "one man, one voice", but "one dollar, one voice", which may or may not reflect the contribution of people to society.

Star Raiders is a video game for the Atari 8-bit family of computers. It was released in cartridge form by Atari in 1979, programmed by Doug Neubauer, an Atari employee. It was also later ported to other Atari computer and game platforms. The game simulates space combat in 3D between the player's powerful ship and an invading fleet of alien "Zylon" vessels.
Star Raiders was distinctive for its graphics, which (under most conditions) represented an out-the-cockpit, first-person view from a fictional combat spaceship traveling through a streaming 3D starfield in pursuit of enemy spacecraft. The game's attract mode, a simple streaming star field, was a common sight in computer stores of the early-1980s to show off the Atari computers' graphics capabilities.
While there had already been simple target-shooting games using this perspective (including 1977's Starhawk), Star Raiders had considerably higher quality graphics and more complex game play. As a result, it inspired both imitators throughout the 1980s and later-generation "space combat simulation" games. Notably, it is one of the games that inspired the seminal title Elite, and thus the Wing Commander and X-Wing series. It is also one in a series of first person space shooters (including 1977's Starhawk and 1979's Star Fire) that appeared in the late-1970s and were arguably predecessors of the later seen first-person shooter genre.
Star Raiders was criticized at the time for violent gameplay.  In 2007, it was included as #2 in a list of the 10 most important video games of all time, as compiled by Stanford University's History of Science and Technology Collections.

Starpath was a U.S. company known for creating the Starpath Supercharger in 1982. The company was founded in 1981 under the name Arcadia Corporation, but it changed its name to Starpath shortly after for trademark reasons (Emerson Radio Corporation had released a video game console named the Emerson Arcadia 2001). It was founded by Alan Bayley, Robert Brown, and Craig Nelson.
The Starpath Supercharger was an add-on for the Atari 2600 video game console that expanded the machine capabilities by adding more RAM, allowing for higher resolution graphics and larger games, and by providing a connector to which a regular cassette player could be connected, thus permitting larger games, stored on tape, to be loaded. The Supercharger was connected to the Atari's cartridge slot.
Starpath merged with Epyx in 1983. Rights to Starpath games are [tpl]As of|2004|alt=currently[/tpl] owned by Bridgestone Multimedia, a religious multimedia company.

The Starpath Supercharger was an add-on module created by Starpath to expand the game capabilities of the Atari 2600 video game console. The device resembled a long game cartridge with a handle on one end. The Supercharger interface added an extra 6 KB to the Atari 2600's 128 bytes of RAM (increasing its RAM 49-fold), allowing for larger games with higher resolution graphics. A cord coming out of the side of the cartridge plugged into the earphone jack of any standard cassette player. Games for the Supercharger were stored on normal audio cassettes.
By providing these capabilities, the Supercharger made the Atari 2600 much more like the low end home computers of the era, aside from the alphanumeric keyboard the console lacked (simple numeric keypads were available from Atari as add-ons, however).

Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games created by Interplay Entertainment. Although the series is set during the 22nd and 23rd centuries, its retrofuturistic setting and artwork are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner for Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 video game of which the Fallout series is regarded to be a spiritual successor. Although the game worlds are different, the background story, inhabitants, locations, and characters draw many parallels. 
The first two titles in the series (Fallout and Fallout 2) were developed by Black Isle Studios. Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East's 2001 Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is a tactical role-playing game.

A third entry in the main series, Fallout 3, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks.

Charles Connell (1810 – June 28, 1873) was a Canadian politician, now remembered mainly for placing his image on a 5-cent postage stamp. Born in the then-British colony of Northampton, New Brunswick to a family of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution, he entered politics in 1846, serving in the colony's Legislative Assembly and House of Assembly.
On August 5, 1835, he married Anne Fisher, sister of Lewis P. Fisher. They had seven children, one of whom died young. She died on October 5, 1895 and is buried in the Old Methodist Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His son George Heber went on to serve in the House of Commons.
In 1858, Connell was appointed Postmaster General of the colony, at a time when increasing trade with the United States was forcing the British colonies to reconsider their currencies and institute a decimal system that would be more familiar to their American neighbors. New Brunswick adopted a decimal currency in 1859, and in the following year, Connell issued the first series of postage stamps in the new denomination.

William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber (fl. 1135–1179) was a 12th-century  Marcher lord who secured a foundation for the dominant position later held by the Braose family in the Welsh Marches. In addition to the family's English holdings in Sussex and Devon, William had inherited Radnor and Builth, in Wales, from his father Philip. By his marriage he increased the Braose Welsh holdings to include Brecon and Abergavenny.
William remained loyal to King Stephen during the 12th-century period of civil war. He became a trusted royal servant during the subsequent reign of Henry II, accompanying the king on campaigns in France and Ireland. He served as sheriff of Herefordshire from 1173 until 1175. The family's power reached its peak under his son William during the reigns of King Richard I and King John.

[[Toxicity]]

CATEGORIES: Toxicology

Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism. Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an animal, bacterium, or plant, as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a cell (cytotoxicity) or an organ such as the liver (hepatotoxicity). By extension, the word may be metaphorically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups, such as the family unit or society at large.
A central concept of toxicology is that effects are dose-dependent; even water can lead to water intoxication when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as snake venom there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. Toxicity is species-specific, making cross-species analysis problematic. Newer paradigms and metrics are evolving to bypass animal testing, while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.

Determining the poverty line is usually done by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.{Poverty Lines-Martin Ravallion, in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, London: Palgrave Macmillan} The largest of these expenses is typically the rent required to live in an apartment, so historically, economists have paid particular attention to the real estate market and housing prices as a strong poverty line affector. Individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances, such as whether one is a parent, elderly, a child, married, etc. The poverty threshold may be adjusted annually.

[[Jealousy]]
CATEGORIES: Emotions, Philosophy of love, Personal life

Jealousy is an emotion, and the word typically refers to the negative thoughts and feelings of insecurity, fear, and anxiety over an anticipated loss of something of great personal value, particularly in reference to  a human connection. Jealousy often consists of a combination of emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness and disgust. In its original meaning, jealousy is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with jealousy now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone.
Jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships. It has been observed in infants five months and older.Draghi-Lorenz, R. (2000). Five-month-old infants can be jealous: Against cognitivist solipsism. Paper presented in a symposium convened for the XIIth Biennial International Conference on Infant Studies (ICIS), 16–19 July, Brighton, UK.Hart, S. (2002). Jealousy in 6-month-old infants.

Human Nature, 15, 283–300.
Some claim that jealousy is seen in every culture;Buss, D.M. (2000). The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy is as Necessary as Love and Sex. New York: Free Press.[tpl]Citation |author=Buss DM |title=Human nature and culture: an evolutionary psychological perspective |journal=J Pers |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=955–78 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11767825 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.696171 |url= |postscript=.[/tpl]White, G.L., & Mullen, P.E. (1989). Jealousy: Theory, Research, and Clinical Practice. New York, NY: Guilford Press.
however, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific phenomenon.Peter Salovey. The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy. 1991.  ISBN 978-0-89862-555-4
Jealousy is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience; it has been a theme of many artistic works. Psychologists have proposed several models of the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. Sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy. Artists have explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, movies, songs, plays, poems, and books. Theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.

Greek: Πρωτεύς), also known as Neptune VIII, is the second largest Neptunian moon, and Neptune's largest inner satellite. Discovered by Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus circles Neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at the distance of about 4.75 equatorial radii of the planet.
Despite being more than 400 km in diameter Proteus has a somewhat irregular shape with several slightly concave facets and relief as high as 20 km. Its surface is dark, neutral in color and heavily cratered. The largest crater is more than 200 km in diameter. There are also a number of scarps, grooves and valleys related to large craters.
Proteus is probably not an original body that formed with Neptune; it may have accreted later from the debris created when the largest Neptunian satellite Triton was captured.

[[Dialogue]]

Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in American EnglishSee entry on "dialogue (n)" in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.) is a literary and theatrical form consisting of a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more ("dia" means through or across) people. Its chief historical origins as narrative, philosophical or didactic device are to be found in classical Greek and Indian literature, in particular in the ancient art of rhetoric.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
While the dialogue was less important in the nineteenth century than it had been in the eighteenth, it was not extinct. The British author W.H. Mallock employed it successfully in his work "The New Republic," which was explicitly based on Plato's "Republic" and on the writings of Thomas Love Peacock. But the notion of dialogue reemerged in the cultural mainstream in the work of  cultural critics such as Mikhail Bakhtin and Paulo Freire, theologians such as Martin Buber, as an existential palliative to counter atomization and social alienation in mass industrial society.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type, named for the Pomerania region in Central Europe (today part of northern Poland and eastern Germany). Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed, and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (Dwarf Spitz).
The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by 50%. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issue is Luxating patella. Tracheal collapse can also be an issue. More rarely, the breed can suffer from a skin condition colloquially known as "black skin disease", or alopecia ex. This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pommania.co.uk/blackskindisease.htm |title=BSD (Black Skin Disease) Alopecia X, Coat Funk |date= |work= |publisher=Pommania Pomeranains |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl] The breed is currently among the top 15 most popular in the USA, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.

The C-5 Galaxy has landed for training, for cargo during Hurricane Katrina, and for the transportation of President Obama's motorcade on September 20 and 21, 2009. An Air Canada Airbus A340-300 (which has seating for 286 passengers) made an unscheduled arrival on December 21, 2007. Also, on August 10, 2012, a United Airlines Boeing 767-400 flight from Munich, Germany was diverted to Albany due to bad weather conditions at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey where the flight was expected to land.
Many times a week, UPS runs a 757-200 for cargo.  FedEx Airlines brings the Boeing 757-200 to the airport about 5 times a week for cargo. Today, about half of the planes that depart and land in ALB are regional aircraft. Airlines that operate mainline aircraft are Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and US Airways. The largest passenger aircraft to fly into ALB daily is the Boeing 737-800 operated by Southwest Airlines with seating for 175 passengers.
The airport previously had pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi access throughout the airport provided by WiFiFee, but recently introduced free WiFi service.

Aceh ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|tʃ|eɪ[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-ace|ʔaˈtɕɛh|[/tpl]); Atjeh (Dutch); or Acheh is a special region of Indonesia. The province is located at the northern end of Sumatra. Its capital is Banda Aceh. It is close to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India and separated from them by the Andaman Sea.
Aceh is thought to have been the place where the spread of Islam in Indonesia started, and was a key part of the spread of Islam in Southeast Asia. In the early seventeenth century the Sultanate of Aceh was the most wealthy, powerful and cultivated state in the Malacca Straits region. Aceh has a history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders, including the former Dutch colonists and the Indonesian government.
Aceh has substantial natural resources, including oil and natural gas—some estimates put Aceh gas reserves as being the largest in the world. Relative to most of Indonesia, it is a religiously conservative area.How An Escape Artist Became Aceh's Governor, Time Magazine, Feb. 15, 2007 It has the highest proportion of Muslims in Indonesia, who mostly live according to Sharia customs and laws.Map of areas with Sharia influence in law.
Aceh was the closest point of land to the epicenter of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which devastated much of the western coast of the province. Approximately 170,000 Indonesians were killed or went missing in the disaster.United Nations. Economic and social survey of Asia and the Pacific 2005. 2005, page 172 The disaster helped precipitate the peace agreement between the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM).
Aceh was first known as Aceh Darussalam  (1511–1959) and then later as the Daerah Istimewa Aceh (1959–2001), Nanggroë Aceh Darussalam (2001–2009) and Aceh (2009–present). Past spellings of Aceh include Acheh, Atjeh and Achin.

[[Northern Lapwing]]

CATEGORIES: Vanellinae, Migratory birds (Eastern hemisphere), Birds of Europe, British Isles coastal fauna, Birds of Ukraine

The Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), also known as the Peewit or Pewit  (imitative of its cry), Green Plover (emphasising the colour of the plumage) or (in the British Isles) just Lapwing (which refers to its peculiar, erratic way of flying), is a bird in the plover family. It is common through temperate Eurasia. 
It is highly migratory over most of its extensive range, wintering further south as far as north Africa, northern India, Pakistan, and parts of China. It migrates mainly by day, often in large flocks. Lowland breeders in westernmost areas of Europe are resident. It occasionally is a vagrant to North America, especially after storms, as in the Canadian sightings after storms in December 1927 and in January 1966.[tpl]cite book|pages=179|year=1986 |publisher=National Museum of Natural Sciences |title=The Birds of Canada |isbn=0-660-10758-9 |author= W. Earl Godfrey |edition=Revised Edition[/tpl]
It is a wader which breeds on cultivated land and other short vegetation habitats. 3[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]4 eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders, up to and including horses and cattle.
In winter it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly arable land and mud-flats.

[[Arrest]]

CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Law enforcement terminology, Law enforcement agency powers

An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the purported investigation or prevention of crime and presenting (the arrestee) to a procedure as part of the criminal justice system. The term is Anglo-Norman in origin and is related to the French word arrêt, meaning "stop".
 
 Arrest, when used in its ordinary and natural sense, means the apprehension of a person or the deprivation of a person's liberty. The question whether the person is under arrest or not depends not on the legality of the arrest, but on whether the person has been deprived of personal liberty of movement. When used in the legal sense in the procedure connected with criminal offences, an arrest consists in the taking into custody of another person under authority empowered by law, to be held or detained to answer a criminal charge or to prevent the commission of a criminal or further offence. The essential elements to constitute an arrest in the above sense are that there must be an intent to arrest under the authority, accompanied by a seizure or detention of the person in the manner known to law, which is so understood by the person arrested
Police and various other bodies have powers of arrest. In some places, the power is more general; for example in England and Wales—with the notable exception of the Monarch, the head of state—any person can arrest "anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence", although certain conditions must be met before taking such action.section 24a, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

It was a source of news, current affairs, and entertainment for millions of moviegoers until television supplanted its role in the 1950s. Newsreels are now considered significant historical documents, since they are often the only audiovisual record of historical and cultural events of those times.Australian Screen: Cine sound Movie tone Australian Newsreel Collection (1929 - 1975)

[[Bail]]
CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Imprisonment and detention, Bail

Traditionally, bail is some form of property deposited or pledged to a court to persuade it to release a suspect from jail, on the understanding that the suspect will return for trial or forfeit the bail (and possibly be brought up on charges of the crime of failure to appear). In some cases bail money may be returned at the end of the trial, if all court appearances are made, regardless of whether the person is found guilty or not guilty of the crime accused. If a bondsman is used and a surety bond has been obtained, the fee for that bond is the fee for the insurance policy purchased and is not refundable.
In some countries granting bail is common. Even in such countries, however, bail may not be offered by some courts under some circumstances; for instance, if the accused is considered likely not to appear for trial regardless of bail. Legislatures may also set out certain crimes to be not bailable, such as capital crimes.

The word authority is derived from the Latin word auctoritas, meaning 'invention', 'advice', 'opinion', 'influence', or 'command'. In English, the word authority can be used to mean power given by the state (in the form of government, judges, police officers, etc.) or by academic knowledge of an area (someone can be an authority on a subject).  
When the word Authority is used in the name of an organization, this name usually refers to the governing body upon which such authority  is vested; for example, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority or the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.

[[Royalist]]

CATEGORIES: Monarchism

A royalist supports a particular monarch as head of state for a particular kingdom, or of a particular dynastic claim. In the abstract, this position is royalism. It is distinct from monarchism, which advocates a monarchical system of government, but not necessarily a particular monarch. Most often, the term royalist is applied to a supporter of a current regime or one that has been recently overthrown to form a republic.
In the United Kingdom today, the term is almost indistinguishable from "monarchist," because there are no significant rival claimants to the throne. Conversely, in 19th-century France, a royalist might be either a Legitimist, Bonapartist, or an Orléanist, all being monarchists.

A sailor, seaman, mariner, or seafarer is a person who navigates waterborne vessels or assists as a crewmember in their operation and maintenance.  The term bluejacket may be used for British or US Navy sailors, the latter especially when deployed ashore as infantry. The Bluejacket's Manual is the basic handbook for United States Navy personnel. 700,000 of the world's mariners come from the Philippines, being the world's largest origin of seafarers.[tpl]cite news |title=Pinoy seafarers' concerns taken up with US Coast Guard head |author=VVP |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/291091/pinoyabroad/news/pinoy-seafarers-concerns-taken-up-with-us-coast-guard-head |newspaper=GMA News |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2013[/tpl]
Etymologically, the name "sailor" preserves the memory of the time when ships were commonly powered by sails, but it applies to the personnel of all vessels, whatever their mode of propulsion, and includes military (naval) and security (coast guard) maritime personnel and members of the merchant marine, as well as recreational sailors.

Paiute: "Shell Flower") (ca. 1844 – October 16, 1891) was a prominent female Paiute activist and educator; she helped gain release of her people from the Yakima Reservation following the Bannock War of 1878, lectured widely in the East in 1883 on injustices against Native Americans in the West, established a private school for Indian students in Nevada, and was an influential figure in development of United States' 19th-century Indian policies.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

Thomas Dartmouth Rice (May 20, 1808 – September 19, 1860) was an American performer and playwright who used African-American vernacular speech, song, and dance to become one of the most popular minstrel show entertainers of his time. Though his act drew on aspects of African American culture and popularized them with a national, and later international, audience, Rice’s “Jim Crow” persona was a racial caricature contrived to flatter contemporary belief in white superiority.

[[Jump Jim Crow]]
CATEGORIES: 1828 songs, Blackface minstrel characters, Blackface minstrel songs, Fictional slaves, Fictional characters introduced in 1828

"Jump Jim Crow" is a song and dance from 1828 that was done in blackface by white comedian Thomas Dartmouth (T.D.) "Daddy" Rice. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. The number was supposedly inspired by the song and dance of a crippled African slave named Jim Cuff or Jim Crow, who is variously claimed to have resided in St. Louis, Cincinnati, or Pittsburgh.[ref]
, see pages 137-138[/ref] The song became a great 19th century hit and Rice performed all over the country as "Daddy Jim Crow".
"Jump Jim Crow" was a key initial step in a tradition of popular music in the United States that was based on the imitation of African-Americans. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. A couple of decades would see the mockery genre explode in popularity with the rise of the minstrel show.  It was also the initial step in the extant tradition in popular music of incorporating African styles and subject matter.
The tune became very well known not only in the United States but internationally; in 1841 the US ambassador to Central America, John Lloyd Stephens, wrote that upon his arrival in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, the local brass band played "Jump Jim Crow" under the mistaken impression that it was the US national anthem.
As a result of Rice's fame, the term Jim Crow had become a pejorative meaning African American by 1838Woodward, C. Vann and McFeely, William S. The Strange Career of Jim Crow. 2001, page 7, ISBN 978-0-19-514690-5 and from this the laws of racial segregation became known as Jim Crow laws.
The expression to jump Jim Crow came to mean "to act like a stereotyped stage caricature of a black person".  See Uncle Tom.

Haverford College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Haverford, Pennsylvania, United States, a suburb of Philadelphia.  All students of the College are undergraduates, and nearly all reside on campus.
The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, the Quaker philosophy still influences campus life. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-ed in 1980.  Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion after the 1970s, and its current enrollment is 1,190 students. As of the 2012–2013 academic year, Haverford College's tuition is $43,310; room and board, $13,290; activity fee, $392; and orientation fee, $210. This amounts to a total of $57,202.[tpl]cite web |title=Haverford College Financial Aid |url=http://www.haverford.edu/financialaid/tuition.php |publisher=Haverford College |accessdate=29 December 2012[/tpl]
Haverford is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which allows students to register for courses at both Bryn Mawr College and Swarthmore College. The college enjoys an especially close relationship with Bryn Mawr College. It is also a member of the Quaker Consortium ("Penn-Pal") which allows students to cross-register at the College of General Studies (CGS) and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. The college was ranked 43rd among all colleges and universities in the 2013 edition of Forbes[tpl]-'[/tpl] "Top Colleges", and 9th among national liberal arts colleges by the 2013 edition of U.S. News and World Report.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/ | work=Forbes | title=America's Best Colleges List[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/haverford-college-3274 |title=Haverford College |publisher=US News & World Report |year=2012[/tpl]  A 2012 Forbes ranking on the colleges which produce the most entrepreneurs per capita placed Haverford first among liberal arts colleges (followed by business-oriented Babson College, Harvey Mudd College, Swarthmore College, Claremont McKenna College, Amherst College, and Williams College) and tenth overall (between Yale and Princeton).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelnoer/2012/08/01/the-most-entrepreneurial-colleges/| work=Forbes | title=America's Most Entrepeneurial Colleges[/tpl]

[tpl]About|the novels|other uses|The Famous Five (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]The Famous Five[/tpl]

The Famous Five is the name of a series of children's novels written by English author Enid Blyton. The first book, Five on a Treasure Island, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children – Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George) – and their dog Timmy.
The stories always take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective boarding schools. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, the location of which varies from book to book. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in Dorset: Kirrin Island, a picturesque island owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay, for example, presents many opportunities for adventure. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old, and often contain secret passages or smugglers' tunnels. In some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. The settings, however, are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and Welsh countryside and sea shores, as well as the adventures, picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips, home-made food, raspberry pop and lashings of ginger beer. (Although the supposed quote "lashings of ginger beer" does not appear in any of the books).
Blyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length Famous Five novels. By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold. Today, more than two million copies of the books are sold each year, making them one of the biggest-selling series for children ever written. Over a hundred million books have been sold.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-540056/Gosh-Look-Disneys-Enid-Blytons-Famous-Five.html |work=Daily Mail |title=Gosh!

Cuniculture is the agricultural practice of breeding and raising domestic rabbits, usually for their meat, fur, or wool.  This differs from the simpler practice of keeping a single or small group of rabbits as companions, without selective breeding, reproduction, or the care of young animals. Some people, called rabbit fanciers, practice cuniculture predominantly for exhibition. The distribution of rabbit farming varies across the globe, and while it is on the decline in some nations, in others it is expanding.

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean.
Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures spanning from the Norte Chico civilization, one of the oldest in the world, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima, which included most of its South American colonies. After achieving independence in 1821, Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and fiscal crisis as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. Economic cycles have mostly been based on the extraction of raw materials like guano (1845–1866) and rubber (ca. 1900).
Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions. Its geography varies from the arid plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the Andes Mountains and the tropical forests of the Amazon Basin. It is a developing country with a high Human Development Index score and a poverty level around 25.8 percent.UN: Peru Posts One of Region’s Best Reductions in Poverty in 2011. Andean Air Mail and Peruvian Times, November 28, 2012. Its main economic activities include mining, manufacturing, agriculture and fishing.
The Peruvian population, estimated at 30.4 million, is multiethnic, including Amerindians, Europeans, Africans and Asians. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua or other native languages. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.

[[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]

CATEGORIES: Louisiana Creole culture, Louisiana cuisine, American cuisine by ethnic group

Louisiana Creole cuisine is a style of cooking originating in Louisiana, United States which blends French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Native American, and African influences,Beggs, Cindy, Gipson, Bridget, Shaw, Sherrie. "Cajun and Creole Cuisine." University of West Florida. Accessed July 2011.  as well as general Southern cuisine. It is similar to Cajun cuisine in ingredients (such as the holy trinity), but the important distinction is that Cajun cuisine arose from the more rustic, provincial French cooking adapted by the Acadians to Louisiana ingredients, whereas the cooking of the Louisiana Creoles tended more toward classical European styles adapted to local foodstuffs. Broadly speaking, the French influence in Cajun cuisine is descended from various French Provincial cuisines of the peasantry, while Creole cuisine evolved in the homes of well-to-do aristocrats, or those who imitated their lifestyle. Although the Creole cuisine is closely identified with New Orleans culture today, much of it evolved in the country plantation estates so beloved of the pre-Civil War Creoles.George Washington Cable, The Creoles of Louisiana, Pelican Press, ISBN 1-56554-752-7 (Despite its aristocratic French roots, Creole cuisine does not include Garde Manger or other extremely lavish styles of the Classical Paris cuisine.)

El Vocero ([tpl]lang-en|The Spokesperson[/tpl]) is a Puerto Rican free newspaper that is published in San Juan.
Published since 1974, El Vocero was at first the third of the four largest Puerto Rico newspapers, trailing El Mundo and El Nuevo Día and leading The San Juan Star in sales. With the temporary demise in the late 1980s of El Mundo, El Vocero became even more popular, becoming the island's second largest newspaper. It is owned since 1985 by Caribbean International News Corp. The owners of Caribbean International News Corp, and therefore owners of El Vocero, are Elliot Stein, I. Martin Pompadur and The Henry Crown Co.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
For most of its history, El Vocero was known as a sensationalist tabloid that dramatized all the violent news. However, in the early 2000s, the newspaper changed its direction, becoming a mainstream newspaper, adding a much broader coverage of entertainment as well as business related news, and carrying more political news, as in the situation in Vieques.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In addition to its regular news section, El Vocero also has business, entertainment, sports, and travel sections, among others.

Colonel Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán ([tpl]IPA-es|xaˈkoβo ˈarβenz ɣuzˈman[/tpl]; 14 September 1913 – 27 January 1971) was a Guatemalan military officer and progressive politician who served as Defense Minister of Guatemala from 1944 to 1951, and as President of Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. 
Árbenz was born in 1913 to a middle-class family, and graduated with high honors from a military academy in 1935. He served in the army corp until 1944, steadily rising through the ranks. During this period, he witnessed the American backed dictator Jorge Ubico use the military to brutally suppress agrarian laborers. As on officer in the army, Árbenz himself was required to escort chain-gangs of prisoners. This process greatly radicalized him, and he began to form links to the labor movement. In 1938 he met and married his wife María Vilanova, who was also a great ideological influence on him. 
In 1944, Ubico's highly repressive policies resulted in a popular revolt against him, led by students and progressive factions within the military, including Árbenz. In the elections that followed, widely seen as free and fair, Juan José Arévalo was elected president with 85% of the vote. Árbenz was appointed minister of defense, and played a crucial role in putting down a military coup in 1949. The Arévalo government began a highly popular program of social reform, aimed at ending Guatemala's feudalistic labor system. 
Árbenz contested the presidential elections that were held in 1950, and defeated Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, his nearest challenger, by a margin of over 50%. He took office on March 15 1951, and continued the social reform policies of his predecessor, including the expansion of suffrage and educational access. The centerpiece of his policy was an Agrarian reform law that granted cultivable land to poverty stricken peasants in an attempt to end the system of debt peonage.  
His popular policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company which lobbied to have him overthrown. Árbenz was ousted in a coup d'état engineered by the United States government and the CIA and was replaced by a military junta headed by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas. Following the coup, Guatemala was ruled by a series of US backed military regimes until 1995, which committed massive human rights violations, including a genocidal campaign against the Mayan population during a civil war against leftist factions. Árbenz went into exile after the coup and died in Mexico in 1971.

The leader of the group is Darrel Frank, who was previously convicted for burglary and assault. Law enforcement officers and felons are excluded from this offer, meaning that Darrel Frank himself could not be able to accept the money since he is a felon.

A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea [tpl]IPAc-en|p|aɪ|ˈ|s|iː|ə[/tpl],Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the Family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the earth. Spruces are large trees, from [tpl]convert|20|–|60|m|ft[/tpl] tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small peg-like structure called a pulvinus. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pulvinus (an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera, where the branches are fairly smooth).
Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on spruces. They are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species).
In the mountains of western Sweden scientists have found a Norway Spruce tree, nicknamed Old Tjikko, which by reproducing through layering has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world's oldest known living tree.Swedish Spruce Is World's Oldest Tree: Scientific American Podcast

Fir (Abies) is a genus of 48–55 species of evergreen coniferous tree in the family Pinaceae. It is found through much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa, occurring in mountains over most of the range. Firs are most closely related to the genus Cedrus (cedar); Douglas firs are not true firs, being of the genus Pseudotsuga.
All native species reach heights of 10–80 m (30–260 ft) tall and trunk diameters of 0.5–4 m (2–12 ft) when mature. Firs can be distinguished from other members of the pine family by unique way of attachment of their needle-like leaves and by their different cones. 
Identification of the species is based on the size and arrangement of the leaves, the size and shape of the cones, and whether the bract scales of the cones are long and exserted, or short and hidden inside the cone.

[[Understory]]

CATEGORIES: Forest ecology, Forests, Plants, Plants by habitat, Habitat, Biology terminology

Understory (or understorey, underbrush) in forestry and ecology refers to plant life growing beneath the forest canopy without penetrating it to any extent. Plants in the understory comprise an assortment of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees together with specialist understory shrubs and herbs. Young canopy trees often persist in the understory for decades as suppressed juveniles until an opening in the forest overstory permits their growth into the canopy. In contrast understory shrubs complete their life cycles in the shade of the forest canopy. Some smaller tree species, such as dogwood and holly, rarely grow tall and generally are understory trees.
Forest understories receive less intense light than plants in the canopy and such light as does penetrate is impoverished in wavelengths of light that are most effective for photosynthesis. Understory plants therefore must be shade tolerant—they must be able to photosynthesize adequately using such light as does reach their leaves.  They often are able to use wavelengths that canopy plants cannot. In temperate deciduous forests towards the end of the leafless season, understory plants take advantage of the shelter of the still leafless canopy plants to "leaf out" before the canopy trees do. This is important because it provides the understory plants with a window in which to photosynthesize without the canopy shading them. This brief period (usually 1–2 weeks) is often a crucial period in which the plant can maintain a net positive carbon balance over the course of the year.
As a rule forest understories also experience higher humidity than exposed areas. The forest canopy reduces solar radiation, so the ground does not heat up as rapidly as open ground. Consequently, the understory dries out more slowly than more exposed areas do. The greater humidity allows fungi and other decomposers to flourish. This drives nutrient cycling, and provides favorable microclimates for many animals and plants, such as the pygmy marmoset.Kramer, D. M., G. Johnson, O. Kiirats, G. E. Edwards. 2004.

The birch family, Betulaceae, includes six genera of deciduous nut-bearing trees and shrubs, including the birches, alders, hazels, hornbeams and hop-hornbeams, numbering about 130 species. They are mostly natives of the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species reaching the Southern Hemisphere in the Andes in South America.
In the past, the family was often divided into two families, Betulaceae (Alnus, Betula) and Corylaceae (the rest). Recent treatments, including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, have described these two groups as subfamilies within an expanded Betulaceae: Betuloideae and Coryloideae.
The closest relatives of Betulaceae are believed to be the Casuarinaceae, or the she-oaks.

Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long-lived, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground, spreading about a metre per year, sometimes eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts can grow from the roots. One such colony of American aspen (P. tremuloides) in Utah, given the nickname of "Pando", is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens.

[[Cyclotron radiation]]
CATEGORIES: Electromagnetic radiation, Plasma physics, Experimental particle physics

Cyclotron radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted by moving charged particles deflected by a magnetic field.  The Lorentz force on the particles acts perpendicular to both the magnetic field lines and the particles' motion through them, creating an acceleration of charged particles that causes them to emit radiation as a result of the acceleration they undergo as they spiral around the lines of the magnetic field.
The name of this radiation derives from the cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator used since the 1930s to create highly energetic particles for study. The cyclotron makes use of the circular orbits that charged particles exhibit in a uniform magnetic field. Furthermore, the period of the orbit is independent of the energy of the particles, allowing the cyclotron to operate at a set frequency. Cyclotron radiation is emitted by all charged particles travelling through magnetic fields, not just those in cyclotrons. Cyclotron radiation from plasma in the interstellar medium or around black holes and other astronomical phenomena is an important source of information about distant magnetic fields. The power (energy per unit time) of the emission of each electron can be calculated:
Cyclotron radiation would likely be produced in a high altitude nuclear explosion. Gamma rays produced by the explosion would ionize atoms in the upper atmosphere and those free electrons would interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce cyclotron radiation in the form of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP).  This phenomenon is of concern to the military as the EMP may damage solid state electronic equipment.
Cyclotron radiation has a spectrum with its main spike at the
same fundamental frequency as the particle's orbit, and harmonics at higher integral factors. Harmonics are the result of imperfections in the actual emission environment, which also create a broadening of the spectral lines. The most obvious source of line broadening is non-uniformities in the magnetic field; as an electron passes
from one area of the field to another, its emission frequency will change with the strength of the field. Other sources of broadening include collisional broadening as the electron will invariably fail to follow a perfect orbit, distortions of the emission caused by interactions with the surrounding plasma, and relativistic effects if the charged particles are sufficiently energetic.  When the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, cyclotron radiation is known as synchrotron radiation.
The recoil experienced by a particle emitting cyclotron radiation is called radiation reaction. Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron. Cyclotrons are prime examples of systems which experience radiation reaction.

Urban secession is a city's secession from its surrounding region, to form a new political unit. This new unit is usually a subdivision of the same country as its surroundings, but in some cases, full sovereignty may be attained, in which case the unit is usually called a city-state. It is an extreme form of urban autonomy, which can be expressed in less formal terms or with ordinary legislation such as a City Charter.
Urban secession movements theories of why a city should be at least partially independent of surrounding regions, goes back to Classical Rome, 17th-century London, 18th-century Amsterdam and other centers of commercial activity. Comparisons focused on the modern nation-state and its relationships to the more traditional feudal city-state government.

Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was produced by Nigel Godrich and released on 5 June 2001 through Parlophone. Recorded in the same sessions as previous album Kid A (2000), Amnesiac incorporates similar influences of electronic music, classical music, jazz and krautrock, and explores lyrical themes of memory and reincarnation influenced by ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology. Bassist Colin Greenwood described the album as having "more traditional Radiohead-type songs together with more experimental, non-lyrical based instrumental-type stuff as well." Singer Thom Yorke described it as "another take on Kid A, a form of explanation."
Amnesiac produced three singles: "Pyramid Song", "I Might Be Wrong" and "Knives Out". It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the US Billboard 200, and received positive reviews from music critics, though many considered it inferior to its sister album Kid A. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked the album number 320 in their updated version of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

The Bends is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released on 13 March 1995 by Parlophone. The Bends was produced by John Leckie at EMI's studios in London, and engineered by Nigel Godrich, who would go on to produce all future albums by the band. Featuring five charting singles, the album also marked the beginning of a shift in aesthetics and themes for the band, with greater use of keyboards, and more abrasive guitar tracks balancing subtler ones. The introspective grunge-influenced style of Pablo Honey evolved toward more multi-layered rock with cryptic lyrics and larger ideas, as the band and singer Thom Yorke reacted against the rigors of near-constant world tours.
My Iron Lung was released as an EP and later, "High and Dry" was released as an A-side with "Planet Telex" as the B-side. "Fake Plastic Trees" was released as the second single, with "Just" as the album's third. "Street Spirit (Fade Out)", the final single and last song on the album, became their first top five UK hit.
The album was subject to greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), receiving an enthusiastic critical reaction, and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single "Creep" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88.[tpl]Allmusic|id=mn0000326249|tab=awards[/tpl] Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the United States and the European Union.

Pablo Honey is the debut studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, released in February 1993. The album was produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio, Oxfordshire from September to November 1992. It features three charting singles: "Anyone Can Play Guitar", "Stop Whispering" and perhaps the band's most well-known hit on mainstream radio, "Creep". Pablo Honey peaked at No. 22 in the United Kingdom charts and went platinum there and in other countries. The album title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says, "Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!" to his victim. This snippet is sampled by the band on the track "How Do You?".
Following the release of Pablo Honey, Radiohead would digress from its alternative rock influences toward more expansive and experimental works. The album received a generally favourable critical reaction, but was criticised for its derivative sound and inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and has been in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent albums. It has, nonetheless, been cited by listeners and critics as one of the best debut albums of recent years.

HiM is a dub influenced post-rock group formed in 1995 by Doug Scharin, drummer for the bands Codeine, Rex and June of 44.  Their first album, Egg, was their most dub-based effort. Each successive album has gone more in a quasi-world music direction.  After some recording for Crooklyn Dub Consortium and Wordsound, "Interpretive Belief System", HiM settled on a lineup of Scharin with Bundy K. Brown, Rob Mazurek and Jeff Parker, members or occasional members of Tortoise and Isotope 217.  Their first album was the underground hit Sworn Eyes, produced by Doug Scharin.  A few personnel changes followed, and the revamped lineup including members of June of 44. Golden released Our Point of Departure in 1999, which signified a very clear shift toward a more jazz-like sound, followed by a major American and European tour.  In 2003, HiM released Many In High Places Are Not Well on Fat Cat Records, which was received as their most successful and fully realized release. Peoples was released in mid-2006, featuring a cleaner sound with more vocals than any of HiM's previous releases.  Included in this line-up are Martin Perna and Jordan McLean from Antibalas, Griffin Rodriguez from Need New Body/Icy Demons, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade). The latest HiM records, "1110" and ん,released in 2008 and 2009 on Afterhours in Tokyo, are collaborations between Doug Scharin, Josh Larue and the Tokyo based group, Ultra Living.

[[Mood (psychology)]]
CATEGORIES: Feeling

A mood is an emotional state. Moods differ from emotions in that they are less specific, less intense, and less likely to be triggered by a particular stimulus or event. Moods generally have either a positive or negative valence. In other words, people typically speak of being in a good mood or a bad mood. 
Mood also differs from temperament or personality traits which are even longer lasting. Nevertheless, personality traits such as optimism and neuroticism predispose certain types of moods. Long term disturbances of mood such as clinical depression and bipolar disorder are considered mood disorders. Mood is an internal, subjective state but it often can be inferred from posture and other behaviors. "We can be sent into a mood by an unexpected event, from the happiness of seeing an old friend to the anger of discovering betrayal by a partner. We may also just fall into a mood." Schinnerer, J.L.
Research also shows that a person's mood can influence how they process advertising.Martin, Brett A. S. (2003), "The Inﬂuence of Gender on Mood Effects in Advertising", Psychology and Marketing,20 (3), 249-273.Martin, Brett A. S. and Robert Lawson (1998), "Mood and Framing Effects in Advertising", Australasian Marketing Journal, 2 (1), 35-50  Further mood has been found to interact with gender to affect consumer processing of information.

The Mountain Meadows massacre was a series of attacks on the Baker–Fancher emigrant wagon train at Mountain Meadows in southern Utah. The attacks culminated on September 11, 1857, with the mass slaughter of most in the emigrant party by members of the Utah Territorial Militia from the Iron County district, together with some Paiute Native Americans.
The wagon train—composed almost entirely of families from Arkansas—was bound for California on a route that passed through the Utah Territory during a turbulent time period, later known as the Utah War. After arriving in Salt Lake City, the Baker–Fancher party made their way south, eventually stopping to rest at Mountain Meadows. While the emigrants were camped at the meadow, nearby militia leaders, including Isaac C. Haight and John D. Lee, made plans to attack the wagon train.
The militia, officially called the Nauvoo Legion, was composed of Utah's Mormon settlers (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church). Intending to give the appearance of Native American aggression, their plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During the militia's first assault on the wagon train, the emigrants fought back and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants.
By this time the emigrants were running low on water and provisions, and allowed some approaching members of the militia—who carried a white flag—to enter their camp. The militia members assured the emigrants their protection and escorted them from the hasty fortification. After walking a distance from the camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the emigrants. Intending to leave no witnesses and to prevent reprisals to complicate the Utah War, the perpetrators killed all the adults and older children (totaling about 120 men, women, and children). Seventeen children, all younger than seven, were spared.
Following the massacre, the perpetrators hastily buried the victims, leaving the bodies vulnerable to wild animals and the climate. Local families took in the surviving children, and many of the victims' possessions were auctioned off. Investigations, temporarily interrupted by the American Civil War, resulted in nine indictments during 1874. Of the men indicted, only John D. Lee was tried in a court of law. After two trials in the Utah Territory, Lee was convicted by a jury, sentenced to death, and executed by Utah firing squad on March 23, 1877.
Today historians attribute the massacre to a combination of factors, including war hysteria about possible invasion of Mormon territory, and hyperbolic Mormon teachings against outsiders which were part of the excesses of the Mormon Reformation period. Scholars debate whether senior Mormon leadership, including Brigham Young, directly instigated the massacre or if responsibility lay with the local leaders in southern Utah.

They are notorious for boring into (and commonly eventually destroying) wood that is immersed in sea water, including such structures as wooden piers, docks and ships; they drill passages by means of a pair of very small shells borne at one end, with which they rasp their way through. Sometimes called "termites of the sea", they also are known by the common name "Teredo worms" or simply "teredo", from the Greek language "τερηδων", via Latin. Eventually biologists adopted the common name Teredo as the name for the best-known genus.

[[Uneconomic growth]]

CATEGORIES: Macroeconomics, Anti-globalization, Welfare economics, Economic problems

Uneconomic growth, in human development theory, welfare economics (the economics of social welfare), and some forms of ecological economics, is economic growth that reflects or creates a decline in the quality of life. The concept is attributed to the economist Herman Daly, though other theorists can also be credited for the incipient idea.Daly, H. 2007. Ecological economics: the concept of scale and its relation to allocation, distribution, and uneconomic growth. Pp. 82-103 in H. Daly. Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development: Selected Essays of Herman Daly. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.Daly, H. 1999. Uneconomic growth and the built environment: in theory and in fact. In C.J. Kibert (ed.). Reshaping the Built Environment: Ecology, Ethics, and Economics. Washington DC: Island Press. Note Uneconomic growth (or uneconomic degrowth) should not be confused with economic degrowth, the reduction of the size of the economy to increase well-being and sustainability.http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/en/
The cost, or decline in well-being, associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of "the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system."Daly, H. 1999. Uneconomic growth in theory and in fact. The First Annual Feasta Lecture, Trinity College, Dublin, 26th April. Available from: http://www.feasta.org/documents/feastareview/daly.htm. Accessed 28 March 2008.Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications. Washington: Island Press.

The Canadian province of Nova Scotia was a British colony with a system of responsible government since 1848, before it joined Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since Confederation, the province has been a part of the Canadian federation and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters.
Nova Scotia has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the Premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly.  The Premier is Nova Scotia's head of government, and the Queen of Nova Scotia is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Nova Scotia, and presides over that body.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 11, 2008|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2125-e.html|date=May 2, 2005|title=Nova Scotia |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801075902/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2125-e.html  |archivedate = August 1, 2008[/tpl]
Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the Premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also occur if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 11, 2008|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/bills_ls.asp?lang=E&ls=c16&source=library_prb&Parl=39&Ses=1|title=Bill C-16: An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act |publisher=Parliament of Canada[/tpl] Nova Scotia has had 27 individuals serve as premier since Confederation, of which 12 were Conservatives, 14 were Liberals, and one NDP.

A spoke is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.
The term originally referred to portions of a log that had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials he used.

Telecine ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|ə|s|ɪ|n|i[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|iː[/tpl]) is the process of transferring motion picture film into video and is performed in a color suite. The term is also used to refer to the equipment used in the post-production process.
Telecine enables a motion picture, captured originally on film stock, to be viewed with standard video equipment, such as television sets, video cassette recorders (VCR) or computers. This allows film producers, television producers and film distributors working in the film industry to release their products on video and allows producers to use video production equipment to complete their filmmaking projects. Within the film industry, it is also referred to as a TK, because TC is already used to designate timecode.

[[Shoegazing]]
CATEGORIES: Shoegazing, British styles of music

Shoegazing (also known as shoegaze) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the United Kingdom in the late 1980s by bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive and Ride. It lasted there until the mid-1990s, with a critical pinnacle reached from 1990–91 and a new zenith achieved again from resurgence in the early 2010s. The British music press—particularly NME and Melody Maker—named this style "shoegazing" because the musicians in these bands stood relatively still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state, hence the idea that they were gazing at their shoes.All Music: Genre: Shoegaze. Retrieved 6 Feb 2010. The heavy use of effects pedals also contributed to the image of performers looking down at their feet during concerts.
The shoegazing sound is typified by significant use of guitar effects, and indistinguishable vocal melodies that blend into the creative noise of the guitars. A general description given to shoegazing and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was The Scene That Celebrates Itself. In the early 1990s, shoegazing groups were pushed aside by the American grunge movement and early Britpop acts such as Suede, forcing the relatively unknown bands to break up or reinvent their style altogether. In the 2000s, there was renewed interest in the genre among "nu gaze" bands.

Lars Johan Hierta (22 January 1801 – 20 November 1872) was a Swedish newspaper publisher, social critic, businessman and politician. He is best known as the founder of the newspaper Aftonbladet in 1830. Hierta was a leading agitator for political and social reform in Sweden during the 19th century. He is sometimes credited as the "father of the free press" in Sweden.
Hierta was born to a noble family in Uppsala, Sweden, as the son of Carl Didrik Hierta and Hedvig Johanna Schméer. He received his primary education at a private school and began his studies at Uppsala University in 1814, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy and a Candidate of Law in 1821. In the same year he was employed as an unpaid trainee at the central government agency Bergskollegium, where he was promoted as a law clerk in 1825.
At the Riksdag of the Estates of 1823, Hierta served as a secretary at the Swedish House of Lords. At the following Estates Assembly, from 1828 to 1830, he was a representative of the nobility and also served as a law clerk. In the Riksdag, Hierta aligned himself with the liberal opposition critical of the conservative rule of King Charles XIV John.
Hierta started writing for Conservationsbladet in 1823. He also wrote for the papers Argus from 1824 to 1826 and, sporadically, Stockholmsposten from 1826 to 1828. He started writing as a humourist, later as a news writer and political editorialist.
In 1829, Hierta started the book publishing house Hiertas bokförlag ("Hierta's Publishing House").
In 1839 Lars Johan Hierta founded a candle factory still active today by the name of Liljeholmens Stearinfabriks AB.
At the time of his death, Hierta was one of the wealthiest persons in Sweden.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Wirén |first=Karl-Hugo |editor= |encyclopedia=Nationalencyklopedin |title=Hierta, Lars Johan |url= |accessdate=2007-12-02 |edition= |publisher=Bra Böcker |volume= |location=Höganäs |id= |doi= |pages= [/tpl] Of his fortunes, his widow Vilhelmina Fröding donated 100,000 SEK to Stockholm University for the establishment of a professorship in economics, and 400,000 to the foundation Lars Hiertas minne ("Lars Hierta's Memory").

[[Power pop]]

CATEGORIES: Power pop

Power pop is a popular musical genre that draws its inspiration from 1960s British and American pop and rock music. It typically incorporates a combination of musical devices such as strong melodies, clear vocals and crisp vocal harmonies, economical arrangements and prominent guitar riffs. Instrumental solos are usually kept to a minimum, and blues elements are largely downplayed.
Recordings tend to display production values that lean toward compression and a forceful drum beat. Instruments usually include one or more electric guitars, an electric bass guitar, a drum kit and sometimes electric keyboards or synthesizers.
While its cultural impact has waxed and waned over the decades, power pop is among rock's most enduring subgenres.Liner notes to The Roots of Powerpop! and the Poptopia! series of CDs.

Symptoms are initially mild, and then develop into severe coughing fits, which produce the namesake high-pitched "whoop" sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing.Symptoms, sounds, and a video WhoopingCough.net The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding.  Prevention by vaccination is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children. Although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected, antibiotics are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness. It is currently estimated that the disease annually affects 48.5 million people worldwide, resulting in nearly 295,000 deaths.

[[Reign]]
CATEGORIES: Monarchy, Time

A reign is the period of a person's or dynasty's occupation of the office of monarch of a nation (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Andorra), of a people (e.g., the Franks, the Zulus) or of a spiritual community (e.g., Roman Catholicism, Tibetan Buddhism, Nizari Ismailism). In most hereditary monarchies and some elective monarchies (e.g. Holy Roman Empire) there have been no limits on the duration of a sovereign's reign or incumbency, nor is there a term of office. Thus, a reign usually lasts until the monarch dies, unless the monarchy itself is abolished or the monarch abdicates or is deposed. 
In elective monarchies, there may be a fixed period of time for the duration of the monarch's tenure in office (e.g. Malaysia). 
The term of a reign can be indicated with the abbreviation "r." after a sovereign's name, such as the following:

[[List of television spin-offs]]

CATEGORIES: Television spin-offs

A spin-off in television is a new series which contains either characters, a different character or theme elements from a previous series. They are particularly common in situation comedy. A related phenomenon, not to be confused with the spin-off, is the crossover.
Many, if not all spinoffs, are produced by some of the original producers of the root show.
A revival series, a later remake of a pre-existing show, is not a spin-off (e.g. The Battlestar Galactica series of 2003 is a revival, not a spin-off of the 1978 version). An exception can be made to series such as The Transformers where the lines of continuity are blurred. If a television pilot was written but never shot, it is not considered a spin-off. When a show undergoes a name change, its successor is considered a spin-off from the original program. For example, Archie Bunker's Place is considered a spin-off from All in the Family, though these types of shows are often considered a "sequel" or "continuation" series.
Neither is a reboot series, a term recently invented for motion pictures, which can also occur in television. This is distinct from a revival in that there is little or no attempt to retain continuity with the original. A recent example is the 1987 series Beauty and the Beast, rebooted as the 2012 Beauty & the Beast, which keeps only the main premise of a female law enforcement official aided by a man-beast, the New York City locale, and the names of the two main characters.
Some spin-offs are "engineered" to introduce a character to one show, just so that that character can anchor a new show (that episode of the original show is often known as a "backdoor pilot"). For example, the character Horatio Caine appeared on one episode of the Las Vegas-based CSI: Crime Scene Investigation before the premiere of CSI: Miami. Shows such as Enterprise, What I Like About You, and Deadline which have no immediate connection to previous series but are still known to exist within the same fictional sphere are also spin-offs.

CATEGORIES: Lists of Canadian first ministers, Premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador, Newfoundland colonial leaders, Newfoundland and Labrador-related lists

The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is the First Minister for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, which was at certain points in its history a colony, dominion, and province. The province had a system of responsible government from 1855 to 1934, and again since 1949. Newfoundland became a British crown colony in 1855, in 1907 it became a dominion, and in 1949, it became a province and joined Canadian Confederation. Since then, the province has been a part of the Canadian federation and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters. The province was named Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=21 May 2013|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2230-e.html|date=2 May 2005|title=Newfoundland |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608210845/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2230-e.html  |archivedate = 8 June 2008[/tpl]
The province has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the Premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the House of Assembly. The Premier is Newfoundland and Labrador's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, and presides over that body. Members are first elected to the House during general elections. General elections must be conducted every four years from the date of the last election. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 12, 2008|url=http://www.assembly.nl.ca/pubinfo/history.htm|title=History of the House of Assembly |publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly [/tpl]

thumb|Brad Wall is the current premier of Saskatchewan.
This is a list of the premiers of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, since it was formed in 1905. Saskatchewan uses a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly.  The premier, sometimes called the prime, or first, minister, is Saskatchewan's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. The premier chooses a "cabinet" from the elected members to form the Executive Council of Saskatchewan, and presides over that body.
Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the premier may ask for early dissolution of the legislative assembly. An election may also happen if the Governing party loses the confidence of the legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.
Prior to 1905, Saskatchewan was part of the North-West Territories and was governed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories from 1870 until 1897, and the Premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905.

[[Production sound mixer]]

CATEGORIES: Film crew, Television crew, Sound recording, Film sound production

A production sound mixer, location sound recordist, location sound engineer or simply sound mixer is the member of a film crew or television crew responsible for recording all sound recording on set during the filmmaking or television production using professional audio equipment, for later inclusion in the finished product, or for reference to be used by the sound designer, sound effects editors, or foley artists.  This requires choice and deployment of microphones, choice of recording media, and mixing of audio signals in real time.
Usually, the recordist will arrive on location with his/her own equipment, which normally includes microphones, radio systems, booms, mixing desk, audio storage, headphones, cables, tools, and a small amount of stationery for making notes and logs.  The recordist may be asked to capture a wide variety of sound on location, and must also consider the format of the finished product (mono, stereo or surround sound). The recorded production sound track is later combined with other elements or re-recorded by automatic dialogue replacement.
Often when filming on video, the sound recordist may record audio directly onto the camera rather than use a separate medium, although a separate copy is often made, as it both provides an extra copy which may have more tracks and also may include other sound captured without the camera.
The sound mixer is considered a department head, and is thus completely responsible for all aspects of production sound including the hiring of a boom operator and utility sound technician, planning the technical setup involving sound including both sound equipment and ancillary devices involved in syncing and time offsets, anticipating and discussing sound-related problems with the rest of the crew, and ordering and preparing the sound equipment to be used on the set.

[[Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality]]

CATEGORIES: Inequalities

The Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality is a basic result of set theory.
It is named for Eugene Wigner and Bernard d'Espagnat who (as pointed out by Bell) both employed it in their popularizations of quantum mechanics.
Given a set S with three subsets, J, K, and L, the following holds:
The number of members of J which are not members of L is consequently less than, or at most equal to, the sum of the number of members of J which are not members of K, and the number of members of K which are not members of L;
n(incl J) (excl L) ≤ n(incl J) (excl K) + n(incl K) (excl L).
If the ratios N of these numbers to the number n(incl S) of all members of set S can be evaluated, e.g.
N(incl J) (excl L) = n(incl J) (excl L) / n(incl S), 
then the Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality is obtained as:
N(incl J) (excl L) ≤ N(incl J) (excl K) + N(incl K) (excl L).
Considering this particular form in which the Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality is thereby expressed, and noting that the various non-negative ratios N satisfy 
it is probably worth mentioning that certain non-negative ratios are readily encountered, which are appropriately labelled by similarly related indices, and which do satisfy equations corresponding to 1., 2. and 3., but which nevertheless don't satisfy the Wigner–d'Espagnat inequality. For instance:  
if three observers, A, B, and C, had each detected signals in one of two distinct own channels (e.g. as (hit A) vs. (miss A), (hit B) vs. (miss B), and (hit C) vs. (miss C), respectively), over several (at least pairwise defined) trials, then non-negative ratios N may be evaluated, appropriately labelled, and found to satisfy 
However if the pairwise orientation angles between these three observers are determined (following the inverse of a quantum-mechanical interpretation of Malus' law) from the measured ratios as
and if A's, B's, and C's channels are considered having been properly set up only if the constraints  
orientation angle( A, B ) = orientation angle( B, C ) = orientation angle( A, C )/2  
had been found satisfied (as one may well require, to any accuracy; where the accuracy depends on the number of trials from which the orientation angle values were obtained), then necessarily (given sufficient accuracy)
(cos( orientation angle( A, C ) ))² = 
Since
1 ≥ (N(hit A) (hit B) + N(miss A) (miss B)),
therefore
1 ≥ 2 (N(hit A) (hit B) + N(miss A) (miss B)) - 1,  
(2 (N(hit A) (hit B) + N(miss A) (miss B)) - 1) ≥ (2 (N(hit A) (hit B) + N(miss A) (miss B)) - 1)2,  
(2 (N(hit A) (hit B) + N(miss A) (miss B)) - 1) ≥(N(hit A) (hit C) + N(miss A) (miss C)),  
(1 - 2 (N(hit A) (miss B) + N(miss A) (hit B))) ≥ (1 - (N(hit A) (miss C) + N(miss A) (hit C))),  
(N(hit A) (miss C) + N(miss A) (hit C)) ≥ 2 (N(hit A) (miss B) + N(miss A) (hit B)),
(N(hit A) (miss C) + N(miss A) (hit C)) ≥ 
which is in (formal) contradiction to the Wigner–d'Espagnat inequalities
N(hit A) (miss C) ≤ N(hit A) (miss B) + N(hit B) (miss C), or  
N(miss A) (hit C)) ≤ N(miss A) (hit B)) + N(miss B) (hit C)), or both.
Accordingly, the ratios N obtained by A, B, and C, with the particular constraints on their setup in terms of values of orientation angles, cannot have been derived all at once, in one and the same set of trials together; otherwise they'd necessarily satisfy the Wigner - d'Espagnat inequalities.
Instead, they had to be derived in three distinct sets of trials, separately and pairwise by A and B, by A and C, and by B and C, respectively.
The failure of certain measurements (such as the non-negative ratios in the example) to be obtained at once, together from one and the same set of trials, and thus their failure to satisfy Wigner–d'Espagnat inequalities, has been characterized as constituting disproof of Einstein's notion of local realism.
Similar interdependencies between two particular measurements and the corresponding operators are the uncertainty relations as first expressed by Heisenberg for the interdependence between measurements of distance and of momentum, and as generalized by Edward Condon, Howard Percy Robertson, and Erwin Schrödinger.

Chrétien de Troyes ([tpl]IPA-fr|kʁe.tjɛ̃ də.tʁwa[/tpl]) (Christian) was a late 12th century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Chrétien may have become known as Christian of Troyes in contrast to the Jewish Rashi, also of Troyes[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl].  Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated).From "Four Arthurian Romances" gutenberg.org. Retrieved March 29, 2007.  One source of information on Chrétien de Troyes' novels is the book by M. Altieri entitled,  Les Romans de Chrétien de Troyes:  Leur perspective proverbiale et gnomique (1976, A G Nizet, Paris).

Pandora ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|d|ɔər|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|pan|DOHR|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Πανδώρα[/tpl]) is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated [tpl]nowrap|S/1980 S 26[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|IAUC 3532[/tpl] In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology.[tpl]sfn|IAUC 4157[/tpl] It is also designated as [tpl]nowrap|Saturn XVII[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|USGS: Planet and Satellite Names and Discoverers[/tpl]
Pandora is the outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters [tpl]convert|30|km[/tpl] in diameter. Majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.[tpl]sfn|Solar System, NASA: Pandora[/tpl]
The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean motion resonances with Prometheus.[tpl]sfn|Renner et al. 2005[/tpl] The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years,[tpl]sfn|Spitale Jacobson et al.|2006[/tpl] when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about [tpl]convert|1400|km[/tpl]. Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.[tpl]sfn|Spitale Jacobson et al.|2006[/tpl]
From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.

Robert Jenkins (born in Llanelli, Wales (fl. 1730s-40s) was a British master mariner, famous as the protagonist of the "Jenkins's ear" incident, which became a contributory cause of the War of Jenkins' Ear between Britain and Spain in 1739.
Returning home from the West Indies in command of the brig Rebecca in April 1731, Jenkins' ship was stopped and boarded by the Spanish guarda-costa La Isabela on suspicion of smuggling. Her commander, Captain Julio León Fandiño, had Jenkins bound to a mast, then sliced off one of his ears with his sword and told him to say to his King "same will happen to him (the king) if caught doing the same".
On arriving in England on 11 June, Jenkins addressed his grievances to the king, and gave a deposition which was passed to the Duke of Newcastle in his capacity as Secretary for the Southern Colonies. In his deposition of 18 June 1731, Jenkins stated that the Spanish captain, "took hold of his left Ear and with his Cutlass slit it down, and then another of the Spaniards took hold of it and tore it off, but gave him the Piece of his Ear again."Haga, Andrea K. Brinton 'Shaping British Identity: Transatlantic Anglo-Spanish Rivalry in the Early Modern Period, PhD dissertation, University of Texas at Arlington (August 2009) (accessed 15 May 2010), pp.152-153. Haga cites source as The Universal Spectator and Weekly Journal, No. CXLI, 19 June 1731.Wright, J. Leitch  Anglo-Spanish Rivalry in North America (University of Georgia Press: Athens, GA: 1971) ISBN 0-8203-0305-4; p. 87; citing Deposition of Robert Jenkins, in Newcastle to Greene, June 18, 1731, PRO SP 94/101. Leitch's "Greene" is possibly a typo, likely Duke of Newcastle's correspondence is to Benjamin Keene, England's ambassador in Madrid.  This report was then forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief in the West Indies, who then complained of Jenkins' treatment to the Governor of Havana.
At the time the incident received little attention, but it was reported in The Gentleman's Magazine in June 1731:The Gentleman's Magazine, June 1731, Ship News this Month, Vol. 1, page 265; accessed 13 May 2010.Dictionary of National Biography, Jenkins, Robert, (London: 1930) Vol. X, p. 743; citing Gent. Mag. i. 265.
In spring 1738, Jenkins repeated his story with dramatic details before a committee of the House of Commons, producing his severed ear (pickled in a jar.) As a result of this incident and petitions from West India merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted (257 "For" and 209 "Against") on 28 March to ask the King to seek redress from Spain.The Gentleman's Magazine, "Tuesday, 28 March", Vol. 8, March 1738, page 162; accessed 13 May 2010. By summer of 1739, all diplomatic efforts having been exhausted, King George II agreed, on 10 July, to direct the Admiralty Board to initiate maritime reprisals against Spain. The Gentleman's Magazine reported that on 20 July 1739 Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a squadron of warships departed England for the West Indies, and that on 21 July, "Notice was given by the Lords of the Admiralty, that in pursuance of his Majesty's Commission under the Great Seal, Letters of Marque or General Reprisals against the Ships, Goods and Subjects of the King of Spain, were ready to be issued."  However, the formal declaration of war against Spain was withheld until Saturday 23 October 1739 O.S..A Very Oddly Named War'The Gentleman's Magazine, "Historical Chronicle: Saturday 23 October" Vol. 9, October 1739, page 551: accessed 13 May 2010.
Jenkins was subsequently given the command of a ship in the British East India Company's service. In 1741 he was sent from England to St. Helena to investigate charges of corruption brought against the acting governor, and from May 1741 until March 1742 he administered the affairs of the island. Thereafter he resumed his career at sea. He is said to have preserved his own vessel and three others under his care during an engagement with a pirate vessel.

The THX system is not a recording technology, and it does not specify a sound recording format: all sound formats, whether digital (Dolby Digital, SDDS) or analog (Dolby Stereo, Ultra-Stereo), can be "shown in THX." THX is mainly a quality assurance system. THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality, predictable playback environment to ensure that any film soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements include a floating floor, baffled and acoustically treated walls, non-parallel walls (to reduce standing waves), a perforated screen (to allow center channel continuity), and NC30 rating for background noise ("ensures noise from air conditioning units and projection equipment does not mask the subtle effects in a movie's soundtrack.")[tpl]Cite web| title= THX Certified Cinemas| url=http://www.thx.com/professional/cinema-certification/thx-certified-cinemas/| publisher=THX, Ltd.| accessdate=2013-07-29[/tpl]

Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 – September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called "The Boy Wonder" for his youth and his extraordinary ability to select the right scripts, choose the right actors, gather the best production staff and make hundreds of very profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty and The Good Earth. His films carved out a major international market, "projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom," states biographer Roland Flamini.[tpl]rp|3[/tpl]
He was born in Brooklyn, NY, and as a child was afflicted with a congenital heart disease that doctors said would kill him before he reached the age of thirty. After graduating high school he took night classes in typing and worked as a store clerk during the day. He then took a job as a secretary at Universal Studios' New York office, and was later made studio manager for their Los Angeles facility, where he oversaw production of a hundred films during his three years with the company. Among the films he produced was The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
He then partnered with Louis B. Mayer's studio and, after it merged with two other studios, helped create Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). He was made head of production of MGM in 1925, at the age of twenty-six, and after three years MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood as a result of his supervision. During his twelve years with MGM, until his early death at age 37, he produced four hundred films, most of which bore his imprint, and their production had adapted his innovations. Among those innovations were story conferences with writers, sneak previews to gain early feedback, and extensive re-shooting of scenes to improve the film. In addition, he introduced horror films to audiences and coauthored the “Production Code,” guidelines for morality followed by all studios. During the 1920s and 1930s, he synthesized and merged the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.
Thalberg created numerous new stars and groomed their screen images. Among those whose stardom was guided by Thalberg were Lon Chaney, Ramon Novarro, John Gilbert, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, Luise Rainer, Greta Garbo, Lionel Barrymore, and Norma Shearer, who became his wife. He had the ability to combine quality with commercial success, and was credited with bringing his artistic aspirations in line with the demands of audiences. After his death, Hollywood's producers declared him to have been, despite his young age, "the foremost figure in motion-picture history" throughout the world. President Roosevelt wrote, "The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces."

[[Singer-songwriter]]

CATEGORIES: Occupations in music, Singer-songwriters, Sociological genres of music

Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose and perform their own musical material including lyrics and melodies. As opposed to contemporary pop music singers who write or co-write their own songs, the term singer-songwriter describes a distinct form of artistry, closely associated with the folk-acoustic tradition.about singer/songwriterThe Singer-Songwriter: Defining the Genre - Defining the Style Singer-songwriters often provide the sole accompaniment to an entire composition or song, typically using a guitar or piano; both the compositions and the arrangements are written primarily as solo vehicles, with the material angled toward topical issues—sometimes political, sometimes introspective, sensitive, romantic, and confessional.
Often, the songs written by these musicians serve not only as entertainment, but also as tools for political protest, as in the cases of the Almanac Singers, Pete Seeger, and Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was inscribed with the words, "This machine kills fascists".

The Nice were an English progressive rock band from the 1960s, known for their blend of rock, jazz and classical music. Their debut album, The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack was released in 1968 to immediate acclaim. It is sometimes considered[tpl]whom|date=October 2013[/tpl] the first truly progressive rock album. The Nice are also a forerunner of the much more widely known Emerson, Lake & Palmer.
The Nice consisted initially of keyboardist Keith Emerson, bassist/vocalist Lee Jackson, guitarist David O'List, more commonly known as "Davy", and drummer Ian Hague, quickly replaced by Brian Davison. The band took their name from Steve Marriott's slang term for being high, a term he used in the song "Here Come the Nice". Marriott originally wanted to give the name to a band he was producing, called The Little People. Andrew Loog Oldham took it upon himself to rename The Little People Apostolic Intervention, and dubbed the Emerson, Jackson, Davison, O'List group "The Nice". Emerson's autobiography Pictures of an Exhibitionist suggests that the name originated with a suggestion from P. P. Arnold. The reference to "being high" is not mentioned, instead a routine by hipster/comic Lord Buckley is quoted.

The Relay servers were connected so that messages would travel hop-by-hop along the network of servers until they reached their destination. The system was named after its behavior which can be compared to a relay race.
The time it took for a message to get to a recipient varied. Most of the time, messages within the United States didn't take more than a few seconds. If network links were down, however, BITNET would store and forward messages for later.  This process could take minutes or even hours.

[[Music of the United States]]

The music of the United States reflects the country's multi-ethnic population through a diverse array of styles. It is a mixture of West African traditions on the one hand and Irish and Scottish traditions with the later addition of Mexican and Cuban elements. Among the country's most internationally-renowned genres are hip hop, blues, country, rhythm and blues, ragtime, jazz, barbershop, pop, experimental, techno, and rock and roll. The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of 4,481.8 million dollars in 2012[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/issue/pdf/RIAJ2013E.pdf|title=RIAJ Yearbook 2013: IFPI 2011, 2012 Report: 29. Global Sales of Recorded Music (Page 24)|publisher=Recording Industry Association of Japan|accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl] and its music is heard around the world. Since the beginning of the 20th century, some forms of American popular music have gained a near global audience.Provine, Rob with Okon Hwang and Andy Kershaw. "Our Life Is Precisely a Song" in the Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2, pg. 167
Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.
Much of modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of African American blues and the growth of gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition to the original white settlers, such as country and bluegrass. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic and Jewish communities, among others.
Many American cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and old time music of the Southeastern states are a few examples of diversity in American music.

Raï ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|راي[/tpl]) is a form of folk music that originated in Oran, Algeria from Bedouin shepherds, mixed with Spanish, French, African and Arabic musical forms, which dates back to the 1930s.
Singers of raï are called cheb (shabab, young) as opposed to sheikh (shaykh, old), the name given to Chaabi singers. The tradition arose in cities like Oran, Relizane, Mostaganem, Chlef and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, primarily among the poor. Traditionally sung by men, by the end of the 20th century, female singers had become common. The lyrics of raï have concerned social issues, such as disease and the policing of European colonies, that affected native populations.Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg.

Chitin (C8H13O5N)n ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɨ|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KY|tin[/tpl]) is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulas of mollusks, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin.  Chitin has also proven useful for several medical and industrial purposes. Bird plumage and butterfly wing scales are often organized into stacks of nano-layers or nano-sticks made of chitin nanocrystals that produce various iridescent colors by thin-film interference.[tpl]cite journal | journal = J of Nanomaterials & Molecular Nanotechnology | year = 2012 | volume = 1 | pages = 2-4  | Author = Morganti P | title = Nanoparticles and Nanostroctures Man-made or Naturally recovered: the biomimetic activity of Chitin Nanofibrils[/tpl]

Alternative country (sometimes alt-country),"The story of No Depression", No Depression, retrieved 19 May 2010. insurgent country, or Americana is a loosely defined sub-genre of country music, which includes acts that differ significantly in style from mainstream or pop country music. It has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have incorporated influences ranging from roots rock, bluegrass, rockabilly, honky-tonk, alternative rock, folk rock, and sometimes punk.
Attempts to combine punk and country were pioneered by Jason and the Scorchers, and in the 1980s Southern Californian cowpunk scene with bands like the Long Ryders. These styles merged fully in Uncle Tupelo's 1990 LP No Depression, which is widely credited as being the first "alt-country" album, and gave its name to the online notice board and eventually magazine that underpinned the movement. Members and figures associated with Uncle Tupelo formed three major bands in the genre: Wilco, Son Volt and Bottle Rockets. Other influential bands included Blue Mountain, Whiskeytown, Blood Oranges and Drive-By Truckers, until they began to move more in the direction of rock music in the 2000s.

Esau is the progenitor of the Edomites and the elder twin brother of Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelites.Metzger & Coogan (1993). Oxford Companion to the Bible, pp. 191–2. Esau and Jacob were the sons of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandsons of Abraham and Sarah. Of the twins, Esau was the first to be born with Jacob following, holding his heel (the Hebrew name Yaacov meaning "Heel-holder"). Isaac was sixty years old and Rebekah is believed to have been younger when the boys were born. The grandfather Abraham was still alive, being 160 years old at that time.
Esau, a "man of the field" became a hunter who had "rough" qualities that distinguished him from his twin brother. Jacob was a shy or simple man, depending on the translation of the Hebrew word "Tam" (which also means "relatively perfect man"). Throughout Genesis, Esau is frequently shown as being supplanted by his younger twin Jacob (Israel).Attridge & Meeks.

The Galápagos Islands (official name: Archipiélago de Colón, other Spanish names: Islas Galápagos, [tpl]IPA-es|ɡaˈlapaɣos[/tpl]) are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the Equator in the Pacific Ocean, [tpl]convert|926|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west of continental Ecuador, of which they are a part.
The Galápagos Islands and their surrounding waters form an Ecuadorian province, a national park, and a biological marine reserve. The principal language on the islands is Spanish. The islands have a population of slightly over 25,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inec.gov.ec/estadisticas/|title=Censo 2010|year=2010|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos|accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl]
The islands are famed for their vast number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. His observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
The first recorded visit to the islands happened by chance in 1535, when the Bishop of Panamá Fray Tomás de Berlanga went to Peru to arbitrate in a dispute between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. De Berlanga was blown off course, though he eventually returned to the Spanish Empire and described the conditions of the islands and the animals that inhabited them. The group of islands was shown and named in Abraham Ortelius's atlas published in 1570. The first crude map of the islands was made in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley, who named the individual islands after some of his fellow pirates or after British royalty and noblemen. These names were used in the authoritative navigation charts of the islands prepared during the Beagle survey under captain Robert Fitzroy, and in Darwin's popular book The Voyage of the Beagle. The then new Republic of Ecuador took the islands from Spanish ownership in 1832, and subsequently gave the islands official Spanish names.Discovery, Darwin and Evolution The older names remained in use in English language publications, including Herman Melville's The Encantadas of 1854.

Although this can be a narrow definition as it mainly excludes heavy industrialised areas which didnt have or had few mines but had lots of forges, iron and steel works and glass works etc which produced lots of polution and would otherwise fit the description and often mines to the far east and west etc had thick coal but required deeper pits as it was further down as with Oldbury, Smethwick and East West Bromwich and that often Black Country dialect, traditions and food is found outside the bentley fault lines and miners, industrial workers and their families often settled in former agricultural cleaner areas due to overcrowding and slum clearances.

[[Public utility]]
CATEGORIES: Public utilities, Political economy, Monopoly (economics), Flow meters, Economics of transport and utility industries

A public utility (usually just utility) is an organization that maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to state-wide government monopolies. 
The term utilities can also refer to the set of services provided by these organizations consumed by the public: electricity, natural gas, water, and sewage. Telephone services may occasionally be included within the definition.[ref]

Greeklish, a portmanteau of the words Greek and English, also known as Grenglish, Latinoellinika/Λατινοελληνικά or ASCII Greek, is the Greek language written using the Latin alphabet. Unlike standardized systems of Romanization of Greek, as used internationally for purposes such as rendering Greek proper names or place names, or for bibliographic purposes, the term Greeklish mainly refers to informal, ad-hoc practices of writing Greek text in environments where the use of the Greek alphabet is technically impossible or cumbersome, especially in electronic media. Greeklish was commonly used on the Internet when Greek people communicate by forum, e-mail, IRC, instant messaging and occasionally on SMS, mainly because older operating systems didn't have the ability to write in Greek, or in a unicode form like UTF-8. Nowadays most Greek language content appears in the Greek alphabet.
Sometimes, the term Greeklish is also used informally for a non-standard language variety used by bilingual speakers of English and Greek, i.e. Greek with heavy admixture of English words or vice versa.

Jomo Kenyattapron. (~1889 – 22 August 1978) was the leader of Kenya from independence in 1963 to his death in 1978, serving first as Prime Minister (1963–64) and then as President (1964–78). He is considered the founding father of the Kenyan nation.
He was a well educated intellectual who authored several books, and is  remembered as a  Pan-Africanist. He is also the father of Kenya's fourth and current President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Kenyatta International Conference Centre, Nairobi's main street and main streets in many Kenyan cities and towns, numerous schools, two universities (Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology), the country's main referral hospital, markets and housing estates are named after him, considered by some a quasi-monarchical leader. A statue in Nairobi city centre and monuments all over Kenya stand in his honour. Kenya observed a public holiday every 20 October in his honour until the 2010 constitution abolished Kenyatta Day and replaced it with Mashujaa (Heroes') day. Kenyatta's face adorns Kenyan currency notes and coins of all denominations (save the 40 shilling coin), but this is expected to change as Kenya's 2010 constitution bars the use of the portrait of any person on Kenya's currency.

John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1 April 1647 – 26 July 1680), was an English poet and courtier of King Charles II's Restoration court. The Restoration reacted against the "spiritual authoritarianism" of the Puritan era. Rochester was the embodiment of the new era, and he is as well known for his rakish lifestyle as his poetry, although the two were often interlinked. In 1669 he committed treason by boxing the ears of Thomas Killigrew in sight of the monarch, and in 1673 he accidentally delivered an insulting diatribe to the King. He died at the age of 33 from venereal disease.
Rochester's contemporary Andrew Marvell described him as "the best English satirist", and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits.http://cerisia.cerosia.org/articles/251/Longman%20Anthology%20Instructors%20Manual/Restoration/76-JohnWilmot_IM.pdf His poetry, much of it censored during the Victorian era, enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards, with notable champions including Graham Greene and Ezra Pound.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Martyr to Sin[/tpl] The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked Rochester's libertinism to Hobbesian materialism. During his lifetime, he was best known for A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind, and it remains among his best known works today.

[[The Book of Five Rings]]

CATEGORIES: 1640s books, Japanese books, Martial arts manuals, Edo-period works, Warrior code

[tpl]Nihongo|The Book of Five Rings|五輪書|Go Rin No Sho[/tpl] is a text on kenjutsu and the martial arts in general, written by the swordsman Miyamoto Musashi circa 1645.  There have been various translations made over the years, and it enjoys an audience considerably broader than only that of martial artists: for instance, some business leaders find its discussion of conflict and taking the advantage to be relevant to their work.  The modern-day Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy.
Musashi establishes a "no-nonsense" theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one's opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on-one duel or a massive battle. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to "investigate this thoroughly" through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading.
Musashi describes and advocates a two-sword style (nitōjutsu): that is, wielding both katana and wakizashi, contrary to the more traditional method of wielding the katana two-handed.  However, he only explicitly describes wielding two swords in a section on fighting against many adversaries. The stories of his many duels rarely refer to Musashi himself wielding two swords, although, since they are mostly oral traditions, their details may be rather inaccurate.  Some suggest that Musashi's meaning was not so much wielding two swords "simultaneously", but rather acquiring the proficiency to (singly) wield either sword in either hand as the need arose.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] However, Musashi states within the volume that one should train with a long sword in each hand, thereby training the body and improving one's ability to use two blades simultaneously, though the aim of this was only for training purposes and wasn't meant to be a viable fighting style.

[[Mu'tazila]]

CATEGORIES: History of Islam, Islamic theology, Mutazilites, Abbasid Caliphate

[tpl]transl|ar|DIN|Muʿtazilah[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|المعتزلة[/tpl]) is an Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thoughthttp://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H052 that flourished in the cities of Basra and Baghdad, both in present-day Iraq, during the 8th–10th centuries. The adherents of the Mu'tazili school are best known for their having asserted that, because of the perfect unity and eternal nature of Allah, the Qur'an must therefore have been created, as it could not be co-eternal with God.Abdullah Saeed. The Qurʼan: an introduction. 2008, page 203 From this premise, the Mu'tazili school of Kalam proceeded to posit that the injunctions of God are accessible to rational thought and inquiry:  because knowledge is derived from reason, reason is the "final arbiter" in distinguishing right from wrong.Oussama Arabi. Studies in modern Islamic law and jurisprudence. page 27-8  It follows, in Mu'tazili reasoning, that "sacred precedent" is not an effective means of determining what is just, as what is obligatory in religion is only obligatory "by virtue of reason."
The movement emerged in the Umayyad Era, and reached its height in the Abbasid period.  Scholarship on the movement stagnated for centuries owing to an absence of sympathetic accounts of the movement (and an abundance of hostile accounts) until the latter part of the 20th century, when the 11th-century texts of Abd al-Jabbar al-Qadi were unearthed in Yemen.Julie Scott Meisami, Paul Starkey.

[[Europop]]

CATEGORIES: Pop music genres, 1980s in music, 1990s in music

Europop (also Euro pop) refers to a style of pop music that first developed in today's form in Europe, throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Many successful Europop artists came from France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] and the United Kingdom, but most[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010|reason=My guess is that, at least in the early '80s, German groups would be more well known in Continental Europe.[/tpl] were Swedish in origin.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, such groups were primarily popular in continental countries, with the exception of ABBA (1972–1983). The Swedish four-piece band achieved great success in the UK, where they scored nineteen top 10 singles and nine chart-topping albums, and in North America and Australia.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Roxette and Ace of Base led Europop in American and British mainstream audiences. In the 1990s, pop groups like the Spice Girls, Aqua, Backstreet Boys and singer DJ BoBo were strongly influenced by Europop. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Italian dance group Eiffel 65 were highly active in this genre. In the 2000s, one of the most popular representatives of Europop music was Swedish pop group Alcazar.
One of the main differences between American and European pop is that Europop is generally more dance and trance oriented. In central Europe, Italo disco (a.k.a. '80s Eurodisco) and Euro house (a.k.a. '90s Eurodance) were the predominant attempts by young musicians to have a hit record in and beyond the borders of their own country.

[[Ancient Greek philosophy]]

CATEGORIES: Western culture, History of ideas, Classical Greek philosophy, Philosophy by region

Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BCE and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated in the Roman Empire.  It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics.
Many philosophers today concede that Greek philosophy has influenced much of Western thought since its inception. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition
is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, Part II, Chap. I, Sect. I Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Early Islamic philosophy, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.
Some claim that Greek philosophy, in turn, was influenced by the older wisdom literature and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient Near East. Martin Litchfield West gives qualified assent to this view, stating, "contact with oriental cosmology and theology helped to liberate the early Greek philosophers' imagination; it certainly gave them many suggestive ideas. But they taught themselves to reason. Philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation."[tpl]cite book |author=Griffin, Jasper; Boardman, John; Murray, Oswyn |title=The Oxford history of Greece and the Hellenistic world |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=2001 |pages=140 |isbn=0-19-280137-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
Subsequent philosophic tradition was so influenced by Socrates (as presented by Plato) that it is conventional to refer to philosophy developed prior to Socrates as pre-Socratic philosophy.  The periods following this until the wars of Alexander the Great are those of "classical Greek" and "Hellenistic" philosophy.

[[Early Islamic philosophy]]
CATEGORIES: Islamic philosophy, History of philosophy, Medieval philosophy, Islamic Golden Age

Early Islamic philosophy or classical Islamic philosophy is a period of intense philosophical development beginning in the 2nd century AH of the Islamic calendar (early 9th century CE) and lasting until the 6th century AH (late 12th century CE). The period is known as the Islamic Golden Age, and the achievements of this period had a crucial influence in the development of modern philosophy and science; for Renaissance Europe, the influence represented “one of the largest technology transfers in world history.”.History of Europe - Middle Ages - Reform and renewal - Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, use TOC This period starts with al-Kindi in the 9th century and ends with Averroes (Ibn Rushd) at the end of 12th century. The death of Averroes effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Arabic School, and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries, namely in Islamic Spain and North Africa, though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular Persia and India where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: Avicennism, Illuminationist philosophy, Mystical philosophy, and Transcendent theosophy.
Some of the significant achievements of early Muslim philosophers included the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or "backing"; the development of a method of open inquiry to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which could be generally applied to many types of questions (although which to apply it to is an ethical question); the willingness to both accept and challenge authority within the same process; recognition that science and philosophy are both subordinate to morality, and that moral choices are prior to any investigation or concern with either; the separation of theology (kalam) and law (shariah) during the early Abbasid period, a precursor to secularism;Kevin Staley (1989). "Al-Kindi on Creation: Aristotle's Challenge to Islam", Journal of the History of Ideas 50 (3), p. 355-370. the distinction between religion and philosophy, marking the beginning of secular thought; the beginning of a peer review process; early ideas on evolution; the beginnings of the scientific method, an important contribution to the philosophy of science; the introduction of temporal modal logic and inductive logic; the beginning of social philosophy, including the formulation of theories on social cohesion and social conflict; the beginning of the philosophy of history; the development of the philosophical novel and the concepts of empiricism and tabula rasa;  and distinguishing between essence and existence.
Saadia Gaon, David ben Merwan al-Mukkamas, Maimonides, and Thomas Aquinas, were   influenced by the Mutazilite work, particularly Avicennism and Averroism, and the Renaissance and the use of empirical methods were inspired at least in part by Arabic translations of Greek, Jewish, Persian and Egyptian works translated into Latin during the Renaissance of the 12th century, and taken during the Reconquista in 1492.
Early Islamic philosophy can be divided into clear sets of influences, branches, schools, and fields, as described below.

Jean Crotti (24 April 1878 – 30 January 1958) was a French painter.
Crotti was born in Bulle, Fribourg, Switzerland. He first studied in Munich, Germany at the School of Decorative Arts, then at age 23 moved to Paris to study art at the Académie Julian. Initially he was influenced by Impressionism, then by Fauvism and Art Nouveau. Around 1910 he began to experiment with Orphism, an offshoot of Cubism, and a style that would be enhanced by his association in New York City with Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia.
A refugee from World War I, he looked to America as a place where he could live and develop his art. In New York, he shared a studio with Marcel Duchamp and met his sister, Suzanne Duchamp. She was part of the Dada movement in which Crotti would become involved. In 1916, he exhibited Orphist-like paintings, several of which had religious titles that also included his Portrait of Marcel Duchamp and his much discussed Les Forces MÈcaniques de l'amour Mouvement, created by using found objects. 
In the fall of 1916, Crotti separated from his wife, Yvonne Chastel, and returned to Paris. He had begun a relationship with Suzanne Duchamp that would culminate in his divorce in 1919 and immediate marriage to Suzanne. An artist in her own right, she would greatly influence Jean Crotti’s painting. In 1920, he produced one of his best known works, a portrait of Thomas Edison.  He would be part of the 1925 Exposition International in Paris, and the International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926 - 1927. Over the ensuing years, he would create numerous paintings and be the subject for several solo exhibitions at major galleries in England, France, Germany, and the United States.
Crotti died in Paris.  
Jean Crotti's heirs donated his personal papers to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, where they can be consulted by researchers.Jean Crotti Papers, 1910-1973. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.
In Spring 2011, Francis M. Naumann Fine Art showed an exhibition, Inhabiting Abstraction, including important examples from every significant phase and development in the realm of abstraction that Crotti explored, as well as one-of-a-kind works such as "Parterre de reve" (1920), in which he framed his painting palette and then signed it.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yau|first=John|title=Jean Crotti: Inhabiting Abstraction|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=April 2011|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2011/04/artseen/jean-crotti-inhabiting-abstraction[/tpl]

[[Carding]]

CATEGORIES: Spinning, Fibers

Carding is a mechanical process that disentangles, cleans and intermixes fibers to produce a continuous web or sliver suitable for subsequent processing.[tpl]cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Nasire Deniz|coauthors=Powell|year=2005|title=The Technology of Terry Towel production|journal=Journal of Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management|publisher=North Carolina Stare University|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://www.tx.ncsu.edu/jtatm/volume4issue4/Articles/Yilmaz/Yilmaz_full.pdf[/tpl] This is achieved by passing the fibers between differentially moving surfaces covered with card clothing. It breaks up locks and unorganised clumps of fibre and then aligns the individual fibres to be parallel with each other.
The word is derived from the Latin carduus meaning teasel, as dried vegetable teasels were first used to comb the raw wool. These ordered fibres can then be passed on to other processes that are specific to the desired end use of the fibre: Cotton, batting, felt, woollen or worsted yarn, etc. Carding can also be used to create blends of different fibres or different colors. When blending, the carding process combines the different fibres into a homogeneous mix. Commercial cards also have rollers and systems designed to remove some vegetable matter contaminants from the wool.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Common to all carders is card clothing.  Card clothing is made from a sturdy flexible backing in which closely spaced wire pins are embedded. The shape, length, diameter, and spacing of these wire pins is dictated by the card designer and the particular requirements of the application where the card cloth will be used. A later version of the card clothing product developed during the latter half of the 19th century and found only on commercial carding machines, whereby a single piece of serrated wire was wrapped around a roller, became known as metallic card clothing.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Carding machines are known as cards. Fibre may be carded by hand for hand spinning.

[[Hayes command set]]

CATEGORIES: Modems

In computer telecommunication, the Hayes command set is a specific command language originally developed for the Hayes Smartmodem 300 baud modem in 1981. The command set consists of a series of short text strings which combine together to produce complete commands for operations such as dialing, hanging up, and changing the parameters of the connection. The vast majority of dialup modems use the Hayes command set in numerous variations.
The command set covered only those operations supported by the earliest 300 bit/s modems. When new commands were required to control additional functionality in higher speed modems, a variety of one-off standards emerged from each of the major vendors. These continued to share the basic command structure and syntax, but added any number of new commands using some sort of prefix character - & for Hayes and USR, \ for Microcom, for instance. Many of these re-standardized on the Hayes extensions after the introduction of the SupraFAXModem 14400 and the subsequent market consolidation that followed.

[[Impasto]]
CATEGORIES: Artistic techniques, Painting techniques

Impasto is a technique used in painting, where paint is laid on an area of the surface (or the entire canvas) very thickly, usually thickly enough that the brush or painting-knife strokes are visible. Paint can also be mixed right on the canvas. When dry, impasto provides texture, the paint appears to be coming out of the canvas.
The word impasto is Italian in origin; in that language it means "dough" or "mixture"; the verb "impastare" translates variously as "to knead", or "to paste". Italian usage of "impasto" includes both a painting and a potting technique. According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, the root noun of impasto is pasta, whose primary meaning in Italian is paste.
Oil paint is most suitable to the impasto painting technique, due to its thickness and slow drying time.  Acrylic paint can also be impastoed. Impasto is generally not possible in watercolour or tempera without the addition of thickening agent due to the inherent thinness of these media. An artist working in pastels can produce a limited impasto effect by pressing a soft pastel firmly against the paper.
Impastoed paint serves several purposes. First, it makes the light reflect in a particular way, giving the artist additional control over the play of light on the painting. Second, it can add expressiveness to the painting, the viewer being able to notice the strength and speed applied by the artist. Third, impasto can push a painting into a three-dimensional sculptural rendering.  The first objective was originally sought by masters such as Rembrandt, Titian, and Vermeer, to represent folds in clothes or jewels: it was then juxtaposed with more delicate painting. Much later, the French Impressionists created entire canvases of rich impasto textures. Vincent van Gogh used it frequently for aesthetics and expression. Abstract expressionists such as Hans Hofmann and Willem de Kooning also made extensive use of it, motivated in part by a desire to create paintings which dramatically record the "action" of painting itself. Still more recently, Frank Auerbach has used such heavy impasto that some of his paintings become almost three-dimensional.
Because impasto gives texture to the painting, it can be opposed to flat, smooth, or blending techniques.

[[Lanolin]]

CATEGORIES: Animal glandular products, Waxes, Non-petroleum based lubricants

Lanolin (German use, from Latin lāna, "wool", and oleum, "oil birth"), also called wool wax or wool grease, is a yellow waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Most lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Lanolin is a wax. Historically, many pharmacopoeias have referred to lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), it is not a true fat.The Lanolin Book, Edited by Udo Hoppe, Published by Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg 1999[tpl]cite journal |author=Barnett G |title=Lanolin and Derivatives |journal=Cosmetics & Toiletries |volume=101 |pages=21–44 |year=1986 [/tpl] Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead.[tpl]cite doi|10.1002/14356007.a09_565.pub2[/tpl] Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin, and the extraction can be performed by squeezing the sheep's harvested wool between rollers. Most or all of the lanolin is removed from wool when it is processed into textiles, such as yarn or felt.
Lanolin's role in nature is to protect wool and skin against the ravages of climate and the environment; it also seems to play a role in skin (integumental) hygiene. Lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in products designed for the protection, treatment and beautification of human skin.

Fishbone is a U.S. alternative rock band formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, California, which plays a fusion of ska, punk rock, funk, hard rock and soul. Critics have noted of the band: "Fishbone was one of the most distinctive and eclectic alternative rock bands of the late '80s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious diversity, goofy sense of humor, and sharp social commentary, the group gained a sizable cult following during the late '80s, yet they were never able to earn a mainstream audience."[tpl]Cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4255|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Fishbone | publisher = AllMusic[/tpl]
Fishbone first assembled in 1979 with John Norwood Fisher (bass); his brother Phillip "Fish" Fisher (drums); Angelo Moore, who sometimes uses the stage name "Dr. Madd Vibe" (vocals, saxophones ranging from sopranino to bass, theremin); Kendall Jones (guitar); "Dirty" Walter A. Kibby II (vocals, trumpet); and Christopher Dowd, who sometimes uses the pseudonym "Charlie Down" (keyboards, trombone, vocals). Founding members John Norwood Fisher, Angelo Moore, and Walter Kibby remain with the band as of 2013.

Amelanchier ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|m|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n|ʃ|ɪər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|am-ə|LAN|sheer[/tpl]),[tpl]OED|amelanchier[/tpl] also known as shadbush, shadwood or shadblow, serviceberry or sarvisberry, wild pear, juneberry, saskatoon, sugarplum or wild-plum, and  chuckley pear is a genus of about 20 species of deciduous-leaved shrubs and small trees in the Rose family (Rosaceae).
Amelanchier is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxonomically in North America, especially in the northeastern United States and adjacent southeastern Canada, and at least one species is native to every U.S. state except Hawaii and to every Canadian province and territory. Two species also occur in Asia, and one in Europe. The taxonomic classification of shadbushes has long perplexed botanists, horticulturalists, and others, as suggested by the range in number of species recognized in the genus, from 6 to 33, in two recent publications.Landry, P. (1975). Le concept d'espece et la taxonomie du genre Amelanchier (Rosacees). Bull. Soc. Bot. France 122: 43-252.Phipps, J. B., Robertson, K. R., Smith, P. G., & Rohrer, J. R. (1990). A checklist of the subfamily Maloideae (Rosaceae). Canad. J. Bot. 68: 2209–2269. A major source of complexity comes from the occurrence of hybridization, polyploidy, and apomixis (asexual seed production), making species difficult to characterize and identify.University of Maine: Amelanchier Systematics and Evolution
The various species of Amelanchier grow to 0.2–20 m tall; some are small trees, some are multistemmed, clump-forming shrubs, and yet others form extensive low shrubby patches (clones).  The bark is gray or less often brown, and in tree species smooth or fissuring when older. The leaves are deciduous, cauline, alternate, simple, lanceolate to elliptic to orbiculate, 0.5–10 x 0.5–5.5 cm, thin to coriaceous, with surfaces above glabrous or densely tomentose at flowering, and glabrous or more or less hairy beneath at maturity. The inflorescences are terminal, with 1–20 flowers, erect or drooping, either in clusters of one to four flowers, or in racemes with 4–20 flowers. The flowers have five white (rarely somewhat pink, yellow, or streaked with red), linear to orbiculate petals, 2.6–25 mm long, with the petals in one species (A. nantucketensis) often andropetalous (bearing apical microsporangia adaxially). The flowers appear in early spring, "when the shad run" according to tradition (leading to names such as "shadbush"). The fruit is a berry-like pome, red to purple to nearly black at maturity, 5–15 mm diameter, insipid to delectably sweet, maturing in summer.
Amelanchier plants are valued horticulturally, and their fruits are important to wildlife.

[[The Orchids]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish pop music groups, Twee pop groups, Sarah Records

The Orchids are a Scottish band that achieved success with Sarah Records.  Formed near Glasgow in 1986, the Orchids released a series of underground singles on the influential Sarah Records (see 1986 in music). The group's line-up comprised James Hackett (vocals), John Scally (guitar), Chris Quinn (drums), Matthew Drummond (guitar) and James Moody (bass). Their producer, Ian Carmichael, often played keyboards on their records. The group split up in 1995, playing their final gig at the Sarah Records farewell party.
The Orchids were musically one of the most interesting Sarah bands[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] and certainly developed far more on that label than any band except, perhaps, The Field Mice.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  Starting with a fairly conventional[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] melancholy guitar pop sound on Lyceum and contemporaneous singles, they moved on to become more keyboard and sample/effects-based for their second and third albums, Unholy Soul and Striving For the Lazy Perfection, developing a more electronic sound, possibly as a result of their producer, Ian Carmichael, who was a member of dance band One Dove.
Their entire back catalogue was re-released on CD on LTM in 2005. The band had already reformed in 2004 with new bassist Ronnie Borland, and released their fourth album Good to Be a Stranger in February 2007. The album was issued on Madrid based label Siesta, with the band playing live gigs for the first time in twelve years. In 2010 the group released a fifth album, The Lost Star through Pebble Records, mixed by a returning Ian Carmichael.

Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music was "colourfully mind-altering, but not in the sense of the acid rock of the 1960s; instead, the band developed its own minimalistic psychedelia" (Stephen Erlewine, AllMusic).http://www.allmusic.com/artist/spacemen-3-p5489 AllMusic Allmusic.com website: Spacemen 3 profile with biography by Stephen Erlewine. Accessed 25/09/2011 Spacemen 3 came to prominence on the independent music scene around 1989, gaining a cult following. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. They gained a reputation as a ‘drug band’ due to the members’ drug taking habits and the candid interviews and outspoken views of Kember about recreational drug use.Vox, Spring 1991. Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their subsequent projects, Sonic Boom/Spectrum and Spiritualized.

East Coast hip hop is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in New York City, USA, during the 1970s. Hip hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in the East Coast. The style in the East Coast emerged as a definitive subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States emerged with different styles. Hip-hop culture has been internationally recognized after its huge popularity in the Bronx, specifically South of the Bronx in the 70s. The main components of hip hop culture during that time and still today are MC’ing, break-dancing, graffiti, and DJ’ing. Jeff Chang “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop”  The main purpose of the rise of hip-hop culture was to keep the people in power with something they could relate to. This ties back to the marginalization of African-Americans for years prior to the rise of hip hop culture. Jan Nederveen Pieterse “White on Black”

Arcesilaus succeeded Crates as the sixth head (scholarch) of the Academy c. 264 BC.http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/arcesil.htm He did not preserve his thoughts in writing, so his opinions can only be gleaned second-hand from what is preserved by later writers. He was the first Academic to adopt a position of philosophical skepticism, that is, he doubted the ability of the senses to discover truth about the world, although he may have continued to believe in the existence of truth itself. This brought in the skeptical phase of the Academy. His chief opponents were the Stoics and their belief that reality could be comprehended with certainty.

Originally a boxer, he came to Athens where he took up philosophy, listening to Zeno's lectures. He supported himself by working as water-carrier at night. After the death of Zeno, c. 262 BC, he became the head of the school, a post he held for the next 32 years. Cleanthes successfully preserved and developed Zeno's doctrines. He originated new ideas in Stoic physics, and developed Stoicism in accordance with the principles of materialism and pantheism. Among the fragments of Cleanthes' writings which have come down to us, the largest is a Hymn to Zeus. His pupil was Chrysippus who became one of the most important Stoic thinkers.

[[Nostalgia]]

CATEGORIES: Emotions, Nostalgia

The term nostalgia describes a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.[ref]
</ref>
The word is a learned formation of a Greek compound, consisting of [tpl]lang|grc|νόστος[/tpl] (nóstos), meaning "homecoming", a Homeric word, and [tpl]lang|grc|ἄλγος[/tpl] (álgos), meaning "pain, ache", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by Swiss mercenaries fighting away from home. Described as a medical condition—a form of melancholy—in the Early Modern period, it became an important trope in Romanticism.
In common, less clinical usage nostalgia can refer to a general interest in the past, their personalities and events, especially the "good old days" from one's earlier life. BoymBoym, S. (2001). The future of nostalgia. New York, NY: Basic Books argues that nostalgia is more prevalent during times of great upheaval.  
The scientific literature on nostalgia is quite thin, but a few studies have attempted to pin down its essence and causes. Smell and touch are strong evokers of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain. These recollections of our past are usually important events, people we care about, and places where we have spent time. Music and weather can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.

[[Countercurrent exchange]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical process engineering, Production and manufacturing, Animal anatomy, Renal physiology, Heat transfer

Countercurrent exchange is a mechanism occurring in nature and mimicked in industry and engineering, in which there is a crossover of some property, usually heat or some component, between two flowing bodies flowing in opposite directions to each other.  The flowing bodies can be liquids, gases, or even solid powders, or any combination of those. For example, in a distillation column, the vapors bubble up through the downward flowing liquid while exchanging both heat and mass.
The maximum amount of heat or mass transfer that can be obtained is higher with countercurrent than co-current (parallel) exchange because countercurrent maintains a slowly declining difference or gradient (usually temperature or concentration difference).  In concurrent exchange the initial gradient is higher but falls off quickly, leading to wasted potential.  For example, in the diagram at the right, the fluid being heated (exiting top) has a higher exiting temperature than the cooled fluid (exiting bottom) that was used for heating. With cocurrent or parallel exchange the heated and cooled fluids can only approach one another.  The result is that countercurrent exchange can achieve a greater amount of heat or mass transfer than parallel under otherwise similar conditions. See: flow arrangement.
Countercurrent exchange when set up in a circuit or loop can be used for building up concentrations, heat, or other properties of flowing liquids. Specifically when set up in a loop with a buffering liquid between the incoming and outgoing fluid running in a circuit, and with active transport pumps on the outgoing fluid's tubes, the system is called a Countercurrent multiplier, enabling a multiplied effect of many small pumps to gradually build up a large concentration in the buffer liquid.
Other countercurrent exchange circuits where the incoming and outgoing fluids touch each other are used for retaining a high concentration of a dissolved substance or for retaining heat, or for allowing the external buildup of the heat or concentration at one point in the system.
Countercurrent exchange circuits or loops are found extensively in nature, specifically in biologic systems. In  vertebrates, they are called a Rete mirabile, originally the name of an organ in fish gills for absorbing oxygen from the water. It is mimicked in industrial systems. Countercurrent exchange is a key concept in chemical engineering thermodynamics and manufacturing processes, for example in extracting sucrose from sugar beet roots.
Countercurrent multiplication is a similar but different concept where liquid moves in a loop followed by a long length of movement in opposite directions with an intermediate zone.  The tube leading to the loop passively building up a gradient of heat (or cooling) or solvent concentration while the returning tube has a constant small pumping action all along it, so that a gradual intensification of the heat or concentration is created towards the loop. Countercurrent multiplication has been found in the kidneysBoth countercurrent exchange and countercurrent multiplication systems have been found in the kidneys. The latter in the loop of Henle, the first in the vasa recta as well as in many other biological organs.

The bandwagon effect is a well documented form of groupthink in behavioral science and has many applications.[tpl]Which|date=August 2013[/tpl] The general rule is that conduct or beliefs spread among people, as fads and trends clearly do, with "the probability of any individual adopting it increasing with the proportion who have already done so".[tpl]cite book |first=Andrew |last=Colman |title=Oxford Dictionary of Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=77 |isbn=0-19-280632-7 [/tpl] As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.
The tendency to follow the actions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to conform, or because individuals derive information from others. Both explanations have been used for evidence of conformity in psychological experiments. For example, social pressure has been used to explain Asch's conformity experiments,[tpl]cite journal |last=Asch |first=S.

The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August, which had reached the outskirts of Paris. The counterattack of six French field armies and the British Expeditionary Force ("BEF") along the Marne River forced the German Imperial Army to abandon its push on Paris and retreat north-east, leading to the "Race to the Sea" and setting the stage for four years of trench warfare on the Western Front. The Battle of the Marne was an immense strategic victory for the Allies, wrecking Germany's bid for a swift victory over France and forcing it into a drawn-out two-front war.

The thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought.   Tillandsia species are epiphytes (also called aerophytes or air plants) – i.e. they normally grow without soil while attached to other plants. Epiphytes are not parasitic, depending on the host only for support. Moisture and nutrients are gathered from the air (dust, decaying leaves and insect matter) through structures on the leaves called trichomes.

An optical computer mouse uses a light-emitting diode and photodiodes to detect movement relative to a surface, unlike a mechanical mouse which has a ball which rotates orthogonal shafts which drive chopper wheels (for example, Gray code encoders) for distance measurement along each axis.
The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces, whereas the modern optical mouse works on most opaque surfaces; it is usually unable to detect movement on specular surfaces like glass, although some advanced models can function even on clear glass. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.

Albany Leon Bigard (March 3, 1906 – June 27, 1980), aka Barney Bigard, was an American jazz clarinetist who also played tenor saxophone.
Bigard was born in New Orleans to a family of Creoles and studied music and clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. He moved to Chicago in the early 1920s, where he worked with 'King' Oliver and others. During this period, much of his recording with Oliver and others, including clarinetist Johnny Dodds, was on tenor saxophone, an instrument he played often with great lyricism, as on Oliver's hit recording of "Someday Sweetheart".
In 1927 he joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in New York, where he remained until 1942. With Ellington, he was the featured clarinet soloist, while also doing some section work on tenor. After leaving Ellington's Orchestra, he moved to Los Angeles, California and did sound track work, including an onscreen featured role with an allstar band led by Louis Armstrong in the film New Orleans (1947).
He began working with trombonist Kid Ory's group during the late 1940s, and later worked with Louis Armstrong's touring band, the All Stars, and others. He appeared and played in the movie St. Louis Blues (1958), with Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Eartha Kitt. 
Bigard wrote an autobiography entitled With Louis and The Duke, and he is credited as composer or co-composer on several numbers, notably the Ellington standard "Mood Indigo".
He died in Culver City, California.

Theobald Wolfe Tone, posthumously known as Wolfe Tone (20 June 1763 – 19 November 1798), was a leading Irish revolutionary figure and one of the founding members of the United Irishmen and is regarded as the father of Irish republicanism. He was captured by British forces at Lough Swilly in Donegal and taken prisoner. Before he was to be executed, Wolfe Tone attempted suicide and subsequently died from his wounds eight days after the attempt, thus avoiding being hanged as a convicted traitor to the British Crown for his involvement in the 1798 Irish Rebellion.

The western part of the South Bohemian Region is former Prachens (Prácheňsko), a huge archaic region with distinctive features with its capital, Písek. In 2011, there were 623 municipalities in the region, whereof 54 had a status of town.
The region borders (from the west clockwise) the regions Plzeň, Central Bohemia, Vysocina and South Moravia. To the south it borders Austria and Germany. Until 30 May 2001, the region was named as [tpl]lang|cs|Budějovický kraj[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|cs|Českobudějovický kraj[/tpl], after its capital, České Budějovice. The South Bohemian Region is further divided into seven districts: České Budějovice District, Český Krumlov District, Jindřichův Hradec District, Písek District, Prachatice District, Strakonice District and Tábor District.
Thanks to its geographical location and natural conditions the region belongs to the areas where the first settlements began to appear in the distant past. In the past centuries, the South Bohemia was famous for fishpond cultivation and forestry. The region has been industrialized since the beginning of the twentieth century. Nowadays, it is an attractive destination due to its natural and culturally historical richness. The travel industry has been recently the fastest growing industry in the region.Characteristics of the South Bohemian Region; Available at: http://www.kraj-jihocesky.cz/foreign/eng/region.php

Coal Chamber is an American nu metal band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1993. Prior to Coal Chamber, Dez Fafara and Meegs Rascón formed the band She's In Pain in 1992. The two decided to create Coal Chamber. They disbanded in 2003 after ten years together, but announced a reunion in September 2011. Their first drummer, Jon Tor, was eventually replaced by Mike Cox (who beat out his older brother for the spot). After bass guitarist Rayna Foss joined, the Coal Chamber lineup was complete.
In 1997, their first album Coal Chamber was released. The album produced one single and a video, "Loco". The video was also added as an extra after the ending credits of Dee Snider's film Strangeland. The band also recorded an exclusive song for the soundtrack titled "Not Living".
Chamber Music followed two years later. Between the two releases and after the band's tour with the metal act Sevendust, bass guitarist Rayna Foss married Sevendust's drummer Morgan Rose and became pregnant, necessitating another bass guitar player on tour, a role filled by Nadja Peulen.
Foss came back for the recording of Coal Chamber's third album, but left after the studio sessions to raise her daughter. Dark Days was released in spring 2002. Their only single and video was for the track "Fiend".[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200316/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Coal Chamber Biography|work=Allmusic|accessdate=February 26, 2008[/tpl]

The Iraqi Republican Guard ([tpl]lang-ar|حرس العراقي الجمهوري[/tpl] ""Ḥaris al-‘Irāq al-Jamhūriyy") was a branch of the Iraqi military from 1969 to 2003, primarily during the presidency of Saddam Hussein. It later became the Republican Guard Corps, and then the Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) with its expansion into two corps. The Republican Guard was disbanded in 2003, after the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition.
The Republican Guard were the elite troops of the Iraqi army directly reporting to Saddam Hussein, unlike the paramilitary force Fedayeen Saddam, and the ordinary Iraqi Army. They were easily recognizable by their red or Maroon berets, rather than the ordinary black of the Iraqi Army. Guard members were mainly, but not exclusively, Sunni Arabs rather than Shi'a Arabs, or Sunni Kurds. They were better trained, disciplined, equipped, and paid than ordinary Iraqi soldiers, receiving bonuses, new cars, and subsidized housing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/02/military_fact_files/v3_special_forces/html/pay.stm |title=US Marines and the Republican Guard: Pay |work=BBC News[/tpl]

The Second Chechen War was launched by the Russian Federation, starting 26 August 1999, in response to the Invasion of Dagestan by the Islamic International Brigade (IIB).
On 1 October Russian troops entered Chechnya.[tpl]Cite book|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|year=2005|edition=1st|pages=1–42|chapter=Introduction: Why Chechnya?|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5|accessdate=28 May 2009[/tpl] The campaign ended the de facto independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and restored Russian federal control over the territory. Although it is regarded by many as an internal conflict within the Russian Federation, the war attracted a large number of foreign fighters.
During the initial campaign, Russian military and pro-Russian Chechen paramilitary forces faced Chechen separatists in open combat, and seized the Chechen capital Grozny after a winter siege that lasted from late 1999 to the following February 2000. Russia established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000 and after the full-scale offensive, Chechen militant resistance throughout the North Caucasus region continued to inflict heavy Russian casualties and challenge Russian political control over Chechnya for several more years. Some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. These attacks, as well as widespread human rights violations by Russian and separatist forces, drew international condemnation.
As of 2009, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement and large-scale fighting has ceased. Russian army and interior ministry troops no longer occupy the streets. The once-leveled city of Grozny has recently undergone massive reconstruction efforts and much of the city and surrounding areas have been rebuilt at a quick pace. However sporadic violence still exists throughout the North Caucasus; occasional bombings and ambushes targeting federal troops and forces of the regional governments in the area still occur.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Russia|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]It's over, and Putin won The Guardian Retrieved on 23 February 2009

Three months later, the exiled leader of the separatist government, Akhmed Zakayev, called for a halt to armed resistance against the Chechen police force starting on 1 August, and said he hoped that "starting with this day Chechens will never shoot at each other".Chechen self-proclaimed government-in-exile lays down weapons Russia Today Retrieved on 29 July 2009

[[Zone melting]]
CATEGORIES: Industrial processes, Semiconductor growth, Chemical processes, Crystals

Zone melting (or zone refining or floating zone process) is a group of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow region of a crystal is molten, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal (in practice, the crystal is pulled through the heater). The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot.  Zone refining was developed by William Gardner Pfann in Bell Labs as a method to prepare high purity materials for manufacturing transistors. Its early use was on germanium for this purpose, but it can be extended to virtually any solute-solvent system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid phases at equilibrium.Float Zone Crystal Growth  This process is also known as the float zone process, particularly in semiconductor materials processing.

[[Reduplication]]

CATEGORIES: Grammar, Linguistic morphology, Phonology, Reduplication

Reduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated  exactly or with a slight change.
Reduplication is used in inflections to convey a grammatical function, such as plurality, intensification, etc., and in lexical derivation to create new words. It is often used when a speaker adopts a tone more "expressive" or figurative than ordinary speech and is also often, but not exclusively, iconic in meaning. Reduplication is found in a wide range of languages and language groups, though its level of linguistic productivity varies.
Reduplication is the standard term for this phenomenon in the linguistics literature. Other terms that are occasionally used include cloning, doubling, duplication, repetition, and tautonym.

David Garshen Bomberg (5 December 1890 – 19 August 1957) was an English painter, and one of the Whitechapel Boys.
Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W. Nevinson and Dora Carrington."Nash, Nevinson, Spencer, Gertler, Carrington, Bomberg: A Crisis of Brilliance", Dulwich Picture Gallery, Retrieved 29 January 2014. Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.Jean Moorcroft Wilson — Isaac Rosenberg (2008)
Whether because his faith in the machine age had been shattered by his experiences as a private soldier in the trenches or because of the pervasive retrogressive attitude towards modernism in Britain Bomberg moved to a more figurative style in the 1920s and his work became increasingly dominated by portraits and landscapes drawn from nature. Gradually developing a more expressionist technique he travelled widely through the Middle East and Europe.
From 1945 to 1953, he worked as a teacher at Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in London, where his pupils included Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Cliff Holden, Dorothy Mead, Gustav Metzger, Dennis Creffield, Cecil Bailey and Miles Richmond.Miles Richmond's website David Bomberg House, one of the student halls of residences at London South Bank University, is named in his honor.

Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal subgenres and their second and third studio albums,  Keeper of the Seven Keys Part I and Part II, are considered masterpieces of the genre. Twelve musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Andi Deris, guitarists Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, and drummer Daniel Löble since 2005.
Helloween was formed in 1984 by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, and Powerfool. Its first line-up consisted of Weikath, Grosskopf, singer and guitarist Kai Hansen and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and a first album in 1985, it expanded into a quintet when singer Michael Kiske joined, with Hansen only acting as guitarist. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. However, Hansen left the band quickly after the release of Part II and was replaced by Roland Grapow. He then created the band Gamma Ray.
Helloween's first two albums without Hansen, Pink Bubbles Go Ape (1991) and Chameleon (1993), were commercial and critical failures, which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and the departure of Kiske. They were replaced by Uli Kusch and Andi Deris respectively. The albums released under this line-up, consisting of Master of the Rings (1994), The Time of the Oath (1996), Better Than Raw (1998) and The Dark Ride (2000), received a warm reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.
However, tensions following the release of The Dark Ride led to the dismissals of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found Masterplan together. Grapow was replaced by Gerstner, but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and no band member was credited for drums on the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in the person of Löble in 2005. Under this new and current line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy (2005), Gambling with the Devil (2007), 7 Sinners (2010), and Straight Out of Hell (2013), with all members except Löble contributing to songwriting.
Since its creation, Helloween has released fourteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than five million records worldwide.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/helloween-7-sinners-first-week-sales-revealed/

[[Nativity scene]]

CATEGORIES: Christmas traditions, Nativity of Jesus in art, Roman Catholic devotions, Christmas in Spain

A nativity scene or crèche ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|r|eɪ|ʃ[/tpl]; also known as a manger scene, or crib) is the special exhibition, particularly during the Christmas season, of art objects representing the scene of the birth of Jesus.Berliner, R. The Origins of the Creche. Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 30 (1946), p. 251.  While the term "nativity scene" may be used of any representation of the very common subject of the Nativity of Jesus in art, it has a more specialized sense referring to seasonal displays, either using model figures in a setting or enactments called "living nativity scenes" in which real humans and animals participate.  Nativity scenes exhibit figures representing the infant Jesus, his mother Mary, and Joseph.  Other characters from the nativity story such as shepherds and sheep, and angels may be displayed near the manger in a barn (or cave) intended to accommodate farm animals, as described in the gospels of Luke. A donkey and an ox  are typically depicted in the scene, as well as the Magi and camels belonging to the Magi described in the Matthew. Several cultures add other characters and objects that may be Biblical or not.
Saint Francis of Assisi is credited with creating the first nativity scene in 1223 (a "living" one) intending thereby to cultivate the worship of Christ, having been inspired by his recent visit to the Holy Land where he had been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.
Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in churches, homes, shopping malls, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings. In the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City annually displays a Neapolitan Baroque nativity scene before a [tpl]convert|20|ft[/tpl] blue spruce.
Nativity scenes have not escaped controversy. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges.

A Partridge Family Christmas Card was originally released as a vinyl album of Christmas music in 1971.  The case of the album contains a reproduction of a Christmas card that was signed by the whole Partridge Family, the stars of a 1970s sitcom. The song "My Christmas Card to You" was original, but the remainder of the tracks were standards.  Like most of the Partridge Family songs, the lead vocals are sung by David Cassidy, who played Keith Partridge in the show.  The album also features one of the few Partridge Family recordings featuring Shirley Jones as the lead singer ("The Christmas Song").
A Partridge Family Christmas Card was the best-selling Christmas album in the United States during the Christmas season of 1971.  It was the number 1 album on Billboard magazine's special Christmas Albums sales chart for all four weeks that the magazine published the chart that year.[tpl]cite book | last = Whitburn  | first = Joel | title = Christmas in the Charts (1920-2004) | publisher = Record Research Inc. | year=2004 | location = Wisconsin  | page = 179 | isbn = 0-89820-161-6 [/tpl]

The Duke of York is a title of nobility in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Since the 15th century, it has, when granted, usually been given to the second son of English (later British) monarchs. The equivalent title in the Scottish peerage is Duke of Albany.
Initially granted in the 14th century in the Peerage of England, the title Duke of York has been created eight times.  Additionally, the title Duke of York and Albany has been created three times.  These occurred during the 18th century, following the 1707 unification of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland into a single, united realm.  The double naming was done so that a territorial designation from each of the previously separate realms could be included.
Since 1461, when the great-grandson of the first duke became King Edward IV, not one of the ten subsequent holders of the title has ever passed it on: they either died without male heirs or became King themselves.
The current Duke of York is Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II. Andrew currently has no male heirs and (since his 1996 divorce) is unmarried.

Joseph Hooker (November 13, 1814 – October 31, 1879) was a career United States Army officer, achieving the rank of major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Although he served throughout the war, usually with distinction, Hooker is best remembered for his stunning defeat by Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863.
After graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1837, Hooker served in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican-American War, receiving three brevet promotions. Resigning from the Army in 1853, he pursued farming, land development, and (unsuccessfully) politics in California. After the start of the Civil War he returned to the Army as a brigadier general. He distinguished himself as an aggressive combat commander leading a division in the Battle of Williamsburg, May 5, 1862, resulting in his promotion to major general. As a corps commander, he led the initial Union attacks at the Battle of Antietam, in which he was wounded. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, he commanded a "Grand Division" of two corps, and was ordered to conduct numerous futile frontal assaults that caused his men to suffer serious losses. Throughout this period, he conspired against and openly criticized his army commanders. Following the defeat at Fredericksburg, he was given command of the Army of the Potomac.
Hooker planned an audacious campaign against Robert E. Lee, but he was defeated by the Confederate Army at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Hooker suddenly lacked the nerve to marshal the strength of his larger army against Lee, who boldly divided his army and routed a Union corps with a flank attack by Stonewall Jackson. Hooker began to pursue Lee at the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, but his poor performance at Chancellorsville prompted Abraham Lincoln to relieve him from command just prior to the Battle of Gettysburg. He returned to combat in November, leading two corps from the Army of the Potomac to help relieve the besieged Union Army at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and achieving an important victory at the Battle of Lookout Mountain during the Chattanooga Campaign. He continued in the Western Theater under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, but left before the end of the Atlanta Campaign when he was bypassed for a promotion to command the Army of the Tennessee. 
Hooker became known as "Fighting Joe" following a journalist's clerical error reporting from the Battle of Williamsburg; however, the nickname stuck. His personal reputation was as a hard-drinking ladies' man, and his headquarters was known for parties and gambling, although the historical evidence discounts any heavy drinking by the general himself. His name is often associated with the slang term for prostitute, although the word "hooker" has been documented to appear with that meaning in print well before he became a public figure.

Chinese social relations are social relations typified by a reciprocal social network. Often social obligations within the network are characterized in familial terms. The individual link within the social network is known by guanxi (关系/關係) and the feeling within the link is known by the term ganqing (感情). An important concept within Chinese social relations is the concept of face, as in many other Asian cultures. A Buddhist-related concept is yuanfen (缘分/緣分).
As articulated in the sociological works of leading Chinese academic Fei Xiaotong, the Chinese—in contrast to other societies—tend to see social relations in terms of networks rather than boxes. Hence, people are perceived as being "near" or "far" rather than "in" or "out".

Horace Greeley (February 3, 1811 – November 29, 1872) was an American newspaper editor, a founder of the Liberal Republican Party, a reformer, a politician, and an outspoken opponent of slavery. The New York Tribune (which he founded and edited) was the most influential U.S. newspaper from the 1840s to the 1870s and "established Greeley's reputation as the greatest editor of his day."Emery, Michael; Emery, Edwin, The Press and America (1988) 124-6. Greeley used it to promote the Whig and Republican parties, as well as opposition to slavery and in favor of a host of reforms ranging from vegetarianism to socialism.
Crusading against the corruption of Ulysses S. Grant's Republican administration, he was the new Liberal Republican Party's candidate in the 1872 U.S. presidential election. Despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party, he lost in a landslide. He is the only presidential candidate to have died prior to the counting of electoral votes.

Gǎnqíng ([tpl]zh|c=感情|p=gǎnqíng|w=kan-ch'ing[/tpl]) is an important concept in social relations in Chinese culture which is loosely translated as "feeling" and is related to the concept of guānxi (relationship network). Gǎnqíng reflects the tenor of a social relationship between two people or two groups.  One can speak of having good gǎnqíng, meaning that two people have a good rapport, or deep gǎnqíng, meaning that there is considerable feeling within a social relationship. However, gǎnqíng can also refer as "love affair" in Chinese.
The term gǎnqíng is often used in comments by the government of the People's Republic of China, and is sometimes mistranslated[tpl]Fact|date=March 2008[/tpl] when used in this context.  Often one will see a statement that an action "hurts the feelings of the Chinese people.""China Hurt by Bjork," The New York Times, March 8, 2008 This statement is better translated as an action that "offends the Chinese people."[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]  When used in this context the statement is actually implicitly threatening that should the action continue, cooperation would not be forthcoming in the future.

Cathy de Monchaux (born 1960) is a British sculptor.
Born in London, de Monchaux studied first at the Camberwell School of Art (1980–1983), and later at Goldsmiths College in London (1985–1987).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artist/11978/cathy-de-monchaux.html|title=Cathy de Monchaux|work=artnet|year=2008|accessdate=2008-07-29[/tpl] 
Her sculptures use materials such as glass, paper, metal and leather. They frequently juxtapose seductive soft elements, often with strongly sexual overtones, with harder materials, often spikey or in some way appearing to constrain the softer parts, resulting in work which is both sensual and threatening. Her 1997 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in particular made reference to organic forms (crustacea, fossils), animals, erotic and fetishistic imagery, turn of the century decorative traditions, architectural detailing and saintly relics.Pennina Barnett  ' Materiality,Subjectivity & Abjection in the Work of Chohreh Feyzdjou,Nina Saunders and Cathy de Monchaux' issue 7 July 1998 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online pp.4-11  
de Monchaux's work from the early 1990s often achieves this effect by the combination of red velvet and steel in simple and strong constructions, but later works have tended to move towards lighter colours, and a more ornamental approach.
de Monchaux was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1998. She currently lives in London and is a part-time teacher at the Slade School of Art. However, she  has exhibited in the United States almost as much, if not more, as she has in England.

Winfield Scott Hancock (February 14, 1824 – February 9, 1886) was a career U.S. Army officer and the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 1880. He served with distinction in the Army for four decades, including service in the Mexican-American War and as a Union general in the American Civil War. Known to his Army colleagues as "Hancock the Superb",Eicher, pp. 277–78. he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. One military historian wrote, "No other Union general at Gettysburg dominated men by the sheer force of their presence more completely than Hancock."Tagg, pp. 33–35. As another wrote, "his tactical skill had won him the quick admiration of adversaries who had come to know him as the 'Thunderbolt of the Army of the Potomac'."Tucker, p. 15. His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of the South and the Army's presence at the Western frontier.
Hancock's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his rare status as a prominent figure with impeccable Unionist credentials and pro-states' rights views, made him a quadrennial presidential possibility in the years after the Civil War. His noted integrity was a counterpoint to the corruption of the era, for as President Rutherford B. Hayes said, "... if, when we make up our estimate of a public man, conspicuous both as a soldier and in civil life, we are to think first and chiefly of his manhood, his integrity, his purity, his singleness of purpose, and his unselfish devotion to duty, we can truthfully say of Hancock that he was through and through pure gold."Jordan, p. 319. This nationwide popularity led the Democrats to nominate him for President in 1880.Tucker, pp. 300–301. Although he ran a strong campaign, Hancock was narrowly defeated by Republican James A. Garfield.

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are a British new wave group formed in 1978, whose founding members, Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), are originally from Wirral, England. While steadily eschewing pop star status, the band cultivated a fanbase in the United Kingdom from 1978–1980. They gained popularity throughout Europe with the hugely successful 1980 single "Enola Gay", and achieved broader recognition via seminal album Architecture & Morality (1981)[tpl]#tag:ref|See:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/event-146548-omd-diamond-rings.html|title=OMD, Diamond Rings|website=Salt Lake City Weekly|publisher=Copperfield Publishing|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/whats-on/music/preview-reinvigorated-omd-go-back-3012617|title=Reinvigorated OMD go back to the future|last=Turner|first=Andy|date=6 April 2013|website=Coventry Telegraph|publisher=Trinity Mirror|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Whats-on-leisure/Choice/This-tour-is-part-of-an-evil-master-plan.htm|title=This tour is part of an evil master plan|date=21 June 2007|website=Cambridge News|publisher=Local World|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]|group=lower-alpha[/tpl] and its singles.

Although retrospectively lauded, the sonically challenging Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European consumer interest during the mid 1980s; Junk Culture (1984) marked a shift toward more pop-oriented songwriting. Concurrently, OMD reached their peak in the United States and had a major hit with 1986's "If You Leave", written for the film Pretty in Pink. Humphreys departed in 1989 with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) to form The Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey to lead the outfit; Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits in Europe. By the mid 1990s, however, synthpop had become unfashionable amid the guitar oriented musical climate, and McCluskey dissolved the band in 1996, months after their last successful single, "Walking on the Milky Way". He founded pop group Atomic Kitten in 1998.
The band reformed in 2006 and began releasing new material in 2009. Their European fanbase remained steadfast: History of Modern (2010) became the group's biggest hit on the German chart; English Electric (2013) their largest in the UK since Sugar Tax.

[[Jetboat]]

CATEGORIES: Motorboats, Marine propulsion, New Zealand inventions

A jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft.  Unlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat, a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat, then expels it through a nozzle at the stern.
Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton (who developed a waterjet in 1954) for operation in the fast-flowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand, specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such waters.
Previous attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes, generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellers.  Unlike these previous waterjet developments, such as Campini's and the Hanley Hydrojet, Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in very-shallow water, and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solution.  From this, the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidly. Through further developments, it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types, and as such, waterjets are used widely today for many high-speed vessels, including passenger ferries, rescue craft, patrol boats and offshore supply vessels. 
Jetboats are highly maneuverable, and many can, from full speed, be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length, in a maneuver known as a "crash stop".  The well known Hamilton turn or "jet spin" is a high-speed maneuvre where the boat's engine throttle is cut, the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again, causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of water.
There is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats, though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of application.  Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about [tpl]convert|20|kn[/tpl], but as boat speed increases beyond this, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders, shafts (etc.) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range (up to [tpl]convert|50|kn|-1|disp=out[/tpl]).  Also, in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds (such as tug boats), the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical.  For these reasons, the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are main concerns.
The biggest jet-driven vessels are found in military use or the high-speed passenger/car ferry industry. South Africa's [tpl]sclass2-|Valour|frigate|2[/tpl]s (approximately [tpl]convert|120|m|-1|disp=or[/tpl] long) are the biggest jet-propelled vessels so far. Even these German-built vessels are capable of performing "crash stops".[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]

A configure script configures a software package for installation on a particular target system.  After running a series of tests on the target system, the configure script generates header files and a makefile from templates, thus customizing the software package for the target system.  Together with Automake and Libtool, Autoconf forms the GNU build system. It comprises several other tools, notably Autoheader.

The Hasmonean dynastyFrom Late Latin Asmonaeus from Ancient Greek Ἀσαμωναῖος (Asamōnaios) from Hebrew Ḥashmona'i.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-he|חשמונאים[/tpl], r Ḥashmona'im; Audio) was the ruling dynasty of Judea and surrounding regions during classical antiquity. Between [tpl]c.|140[/tpl] BC and [tpl]c.|116[/tpl] BC, the dynasty ruled semi-autonomously from the Seleucids in the region of Judea. From 110 BC, with the Seleucid empire disintegrating, the dynasty became fully independent, expanded into the neighbouring regions of Galilee, Iturea, Perea, Idumea and Samaria, and took the title "basileus". Some modern scholars refer to this period as an independent kingdom of Israel.Leon James Wood, David O'Brien, A survey of Israel's history, Zondervan, 1986 In 63 BC, the kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic, broken up and set up as a Roman client state. The Kingdom had survived for 103 years before yielding to the Herodian Dynasty in 37 BC. Even then, Herod the Great tried to bolster the legitimacy of his reign by marrying a Hasmonean princess, Mariamne, and planning to drown the last male Hasmonean heir at his Jericho palace.
The dynasty was established under the leadership of Simon Maccabaeus, two decades after his brother Judas the Maccabee ( יהדה המכבי "Hammer") defeated the Seleucid army during the Maccabean Revolt. According to historical sources, including 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees and the first book of The Jewish War by Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (AD 37–[tpl]c.|100[/tpl]),[tpl]cite book|title=Flavius Josephus|author=Louis H. Feldman, Steve Mason|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=1999[/tpl] after Antiochus IV's successful invasion of Ptolemaic Egypt was turned back by the intervention of the Roman Republic,Schäfer (2003), pp. 36–40.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, XLV:12 Antiochus instead moved to assert strict control over Israel, sacking Jerusalem and its Temple, suppressing Jewish religious and cultural observances, and imposing Hellenistic practices. The ensuing revolt by the Jews (167 BC) began a twenty-five-year period of Jewish independence potentiated by the steady collapse of the Seleucid Empire under attacks from the rising powers of the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire.  However, the same power vacuum that enabled the Jewish state to be recognized by the Roman Senate [tpl]c.|139[/tpl] BC was later exploited by the Romans themselves.  Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Simon's great-grandsons, became pawns in a proxy war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. The deaths of Pompey (48 BC), Caesar (44 BC), and the related Roman civil wars temporarily relaxed Rome's grip on Israel, allowing a very brief Hasmonean resurgence backed by the Parthian Empire.  This short independence was rapidly crushed by the Romans under Mark Antony and Octavian. The installation of Herod the Great (an Idumean) as king in 37 BC made Israel a Roman client state and marked the end of the Hasmonean dynasty. In AD 6, Rome joined Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea (biblical Edom) into the Roman province of Iudaea. In AD 44, Rome installed the rule of a Roman procurator side by side with the rule of the Herodian kings (specifically Agrippa I 41–44 and Agrippa II 50–100).

In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points).Ericson, Christer. Real-time Collision Detection. Elsevier, 2005, p. 13. Collision response deals with simulating what happens when a collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics).

[[Metropolis light transport]]

CATEGORIES: Monte Carlo methods, Global illumination algorithms

The Metropolis light transport (MLT) is a SIGGRAPH 1997 paper by Eric Veach and Leonidas J. Guibas,[tpl]Cite doi|10.1145/258734.258775[/tpl] describing an application of a variant of the Monte Carlo method called the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to the rendering equation for generating images from detailed physical descriptions of three-dimensional scenes.
The procedure constructs paths from the eye to a light source using bidirectional path tracing, then constructs slight modifications to the path.  Some careful statistical calculation (the Metropolis algorithm) is used to compute the appropriate distribution of brightness over the image.  This procedure has the advantage, relative to bidirectional path tracing, that once a path has been found from light to eye, the algorithm can then explore nearby paths; thus difficult-to-find light paths can be explored more thoroughly with the same number of simulated photons.  In short, the algorithm generates a path and stores the path's 'nodes' in a list. It can then modify the path by adding extra nodes and creating a new light path. While creating this new path, the algorithm decides how many new 'nodes' to add and whether or not these new nodes will actually create a new path.
Metropolis Light Transport is an unbiased method that, in some cases (but not always), converges to a solution of the rendering equation faster than other unbiased algorithms such as path tracing or bidirectional path tracing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

Terrazo is a book written in 1947 by Puerto Rican writer Abelardo Diaz Alfaro. The book won many awards, including that of the Sociedad de Periodistas Universitario y Instituto de Literatura Puertorriqueña,[tpl]cite book |title=Caribbean writers: a bio-bibliographical-critical encyclopedia |last=Herdeck |first=Donald E. |coauthors=Maurice Alcibiade Lubin, Margaret Herdeck |year=1979 |publisher=Three Continents Press |isbn=978-0-914478-74-4 |page=705 [/tpl] and made it to the national libraries of many other Latin American countries where Diaz Alfaro was a known and respected writer.
Terrazo tells the stories of abuse, racism and suffering of many Puerto Rican blacks during the 19th century at the hands of Puerto Rico's vast white majority. Its 20 chapters, while presumably made up of fictional stories, talk about the way many black workers used to be treated by many white slave owners.
The book has been considered by many as one of the tools that helped Puerto Rican people realize that there was some racism in Puerto Rico's past.

[[Elasticity (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Elasticity (economics), Microeconomics

In economics, elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another.  For example:
An elastic variable (or elasticity value greater than 1) is one which responds more than proportionally to changes in other variables.  In contrast, an inelastic variable (or elasticity value less than 1) is one which changes less than proportionally in response to changes in other variables.
Elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable, when the latter variable has a causal influence on the former. It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in a unitless way. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
Elasticity is one of the most important concepts in neoclassical economic theory. It is useful in understanding the incidence of indirect taxation, marginal concepts as they relate to the theory of the firm, and distribution of wealth and different types of goods as they relate to the theory of consumer choice. Elasticity is also crucially important in any discussion of welfare distribution, in particular consumer surplus, producer surplus, or government surplus.
In empirical work an elasticity is the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs. Elasticity is a popular tool among empiricists because it is independent of units and thus simplifies data analysis.
A major study of the price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand for US products was undertaken by Hendrik S. Houthakker and Lester D. Taylor.Hendrik S. Houthakker, Lester D. Taylor (1970).
