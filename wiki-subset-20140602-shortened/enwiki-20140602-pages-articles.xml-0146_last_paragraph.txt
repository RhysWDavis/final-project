[[Therapeutic index]]

CATEGORIES: Pharmacology

The therapeutic index (also known as therapeutic ratio) is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes death (in animal studies) or toxicity (in human studies).Katzung and Trevor's Pharmacology Examination & Board Review; 9th edition; A.J.Trevor, B.G. Katzung, S.B.Masters, McGraw Hill, 2010, p. 15.
Quantitatively, it is the ratio given by the lethal or toxic dose divided by the therapeutic dose.
In animal studies, the  therapeutic index is the lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population (LD50) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population (ED50).
Lethality is not determined in human clinical trials; instead, the dose that produces a toxicity in 50% of the population (TD50) is used to calculate the therapeutic index.
While the lethal dose is important to determine in animal studies, there are usually severe toxicities that occur at sublethal doses in humans, and these toxicities often limit the maximum dose of a drug. A higher therapeutic index is preferable to a lower one: a patient would have to take a much higher dose of such a drug to reach the lethal/toxic threshold than the dose taken to elicit the therapeutic effect.
Generally, a drug or other therapeutic agent with a narrow therapeutic range (i.e. having little difference between toxic and therapeutic doses) may have its dosage adjusted according to measurements of the actual blood levels achieved in the person taking it. This may be achieved through therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) protocols.
The therapeutic index varies widely among substances: most forgiving among the opioid analgesics is remifentanyl, which offers a therapeutic index of 33,000:1; tetrahydrocannabinol, a sedative and analgesic of herbal origin (cannabis), has a safe therapeutic index of 1000:1, while diazepam, a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant has a less-forgiving index of 100:1 and morphine, a sedative, antidepressant, and analgesic also of herbal origin (genus Papaver) has an index of 70:1[tpl]cite journal |pmc=1312206 | pmid=16389318| journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent)| year=2000| volume=13|issue=1|pages= 7–10|pmc= 1821133|title=Anesthesia for the 21st century|first=Theodore H| last=Stanley[/tpl] (which, however, is still considered very safe).
Less safe are cocaine, a stimulant and local anaesthetic; ethanol (colloquially, the "alcohol" in alcoholic beverages), a widely available sedative consumed world-wide: the therapeutic indices for these substances are 15:1 and 10:1 respectively.  Even less-safe are drugs such as digoxin, a cardiac glycoside; its therapeutic index is approximately 2:1. Other examples of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, which may require drug monitoring both to achieve therapeutic levels and to minimize toxicity, include: paracetamol (acetaminophen), dimercaprol, theophylline, warfarin and lithium carbonate. Some antibiotics require monitoring to balance efficacy with minimizing adverse effects, including: gentamicin, vancomycin, amphotericin B (nicknamed 'amphoterrible' for this very reason), and polymyxin B.
The effective therapeutic index can be affected by targeting, in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its area of effect.  For example, in radiation therapy for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to the profile of a tumor in the "beam's eye view" can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as is done in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors and in chemoembolization or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases.  This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.
Sometimes the term safety ratio is used instead, particularly when referring to psychoactive drugs used for non-therapeutic purposes, e.g. recreational use.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://rgable.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/toxicity-addiction-offprint2.pdf|title=Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances|first=Robert S|last=Gable,|journal=Addiction|pages=686–696|year=2004|format=PDF|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00744.x|pmid=15139867|volume=99[/tpl]  In such cases, the "effective" dose is the amount and frequency that produces the desired effect, which can vary, and can be greater or less than the therapeutically effective dose.
A therapeutic index does not consider drug interactions or synergistic effects.  For example, the risk associated with benzodiazepines increases significantly when taken with alcohol, opiates, or stimulants when compared with being taken alone.[tpl]medcn|date=September 2013[/tpl]  Therapeutic index also does not take into account the ease or difficulty of reaching a toxic or lethal dose. This is more of a consideration for recreational drug users, as the purity can be highly variable.
Protective index  is a similar concept, except that it uses TD50 (median toxic dose) in place of LD50.  For many substances, toxic effects can occur at levels far below those needed to cause death, and thus the protective index (if toxicity is properly specified) is often more informative about a substance's relative safety.  Nevertheless, the therapeutic index is still useful as it can be considered an upper bound for the protective index, and the former also has the advantages of objectivity and easier comprehension.

Bicycle messengers (also known as bike or cycle couriers) are people who work for courier companies (also known as messenger companies) carrying and delivering items by bicycle. Bicycle messengers are most often found in the central business districts of metropolitan areas. Courier companies use bike messengers because bicycle travel is less subject to unexpected holdups in city traffic jams, and is not deterred by parking limitations, fees or fines in high density development that can hinder or prevent delivery by motor vehicle, thereby offering a predictable delivery time.

[[Digitoxin]]

CATEGORIES: Cardenolides

Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside. It has similar structure and effects to digoxin (though the effects are longer-lasting).  Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so could be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function.  However, it is now rarely used in current Western medical practice.  While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.[tpl]cite journal | author = Belz, G.

Carmeli Brigade (Hebrew: חטיבת כרמלי, Hativat Carmeli, also known as the 2nd Brigade, former 165th Brigade) is a reserve infantry brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, part of the Northern Command. Today the brigade consists of four battalions, including one reconnaissance battalion. The brigade is made up of soldiers who have completed their mandatory service in the 13th (Gideon) Battalion of the Golani Brigade.
The brigade was formed on February 22, 1948 during the 1948 Palestine War, when the Levanoni Brigade in the Galilee split into the 1st Golani Brigade and the 2nd Carmeli Brigade. In its early days the brigade gained control over three battalions - 21st,22nd and 23rd, later during the war 24th battalion was established. It has since participated in all of Israel's major wars and nearly all major operations, including the Sinai War, Six-Day War, War of Attrition, Yom Kippur War, Operation Litani, the first and second wars in Lebanon, and various operations during the Palestinian intifadas.

[[Allopatric speciation]]
CATEGORIES: Ecology, Speciation, Biology terminology, Ecology terminology

Allopatric speciation (from the ancient Greek allos, "other" + Greek patris, "fatherland") or geographic speciation is  speciation that occurs when biological populations of the same species become vicariant — isolated from each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with genetic interchange. This can be the result of population dispersal leading to emigration, or by geographical changes such as mountain formation, island formation, or large scale human activities (for example agricultural and civil engineering developments). The vicariant populations then undergo genotypic or phenotypic divergence as: (a) they become subjected to different selective pressures, (b) they independently undergo genetic drift, and (c) different mutations arise in the populations' gene pools.[tpl]Harvnb|Hoskin |2005|p=1353[/tpl] 
The separate populations over time may  evolve distinctly different characteristics. If the geographical barriers are later removed, members of the two populations may be unable to successfully mate with each other, at which point, the genetically isolated groups have emerged as different species. Allopatric isolation is a key factor in speciation and a common process by which new species arise.[tpl]Harvnb|Lande|1980|p=463[/tpl] Adaptive radiation, as observed by Charles Darwin in Galapagos finches, is a consequence of allopatric speciation among island populations.

A rope is a group of plies, yarns or strands which are twisted or braided together in order to combine them into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting, but are too flexible to provide compressive strength. As a result, they cannot be used for pushing or similar compressive applications. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, line, string, and twine. Ropes made from metal strands are called wire rope.

[[Continental Baptist Churches]]

CATEGORIES: Religious organizations established in 1983, Baptist denominations in North America, Christian denominations founded in the United States, Reformed denominations in the United States, Baptist denominations established in the 20th century

[tpl]Baptist[/tpl]Continental Baptist Churches is an association of "Calvinistic"  Baptist churches holding New Covenant theology, organized in June 1983. The roots of this movement are in the Baptist Reformation Review, founded by Norbert Ward at Nashville, Tennessee in 1972, and the Sword and the Trowel, edited by Ron McKinney of Dallas, Texas. Both of these papers espoused the doctrines of grace. 
In 1979, the Sword and Trowel leaders began to sponsor an annual "Council on Baptist Theology." Through this form of exchange, it became clear that this "Dallas" group held different understandings, especially in the area of Covenant Theology, from those espoused by northeastern Reformed Baptists led by Walter Chantry and Albert N. Martin. This led the "Dallas" ("Sword and Trowel") churches to form their own association – Continental Baptist Churches. This group began with about twenty churches.
Beliefs held by the churches of this body include the doctrines of grace, often referred to as the Five Points of Calvinism, the gathered believers church, believers' baptism by immersion requisite to church membership and to participation at the Lord's table, and the autonomy of each local church. Continental Baptist Churches accept the First London Confession of Faith (1646 edition) as a general expression of their beliefs.
Continental Baptist churches generally disagree with other Baptists in the Reformed tradition concerning the function of the moral law and the ten commandments in the Christian age, maintaining, for instance, the seventh-day Sabbath position that Christians have no obligation to observe the first day of the week as Christian Sabbath because of the fourth commandment.
The organizational structure includes an Executive Committee composed of a Council elected by the churches and the officers (Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer) elected by the association. A periodical called Kindred Minds is the official publication of Continental Baptist Churches. The association holds a Bible Conference and business meeting each year. In 1995, 9 churches were participating in the association. Membership is open to any Baptist church "on the North American continent which subscribes to the Constitution and Articles of Faith of the Association." These churches must be received by majority vote of the messengers at the annual meeting. Continental Baptist Churches also cooperates with the Sovereign Grace Baptist Association of Churches.

[[Graphing calculator]]
CATEGORIES: Embedded systems, Graphing calculators, Programmable calculators, 1985 introductions

A graphing calculator (also graphics / graphic calculator) typically refers to a class of handheld scientific calculators that are capable of plotting graphs, solving simultaneous equations, and performing numerous other tasks with variables. Most popular graphing calculators are also programmable, allowing the user to create customized programs, typically for scientific/engineering and education applications. Due to their large displays intended for graphing, they can also accommodate several lines of text and calculations at a time.
Some of the more recent graphing calculators are capable of color output, and also feature animated and interactive drawing of math plots (2D and 3D), other figures such as animated Algebra theorems, preparation of documents which can include these plots and drawings, etc. This is giving the new graphing calculators a presence even in high school courses where they were formerly disallowed. Some calculator manufacturers also offer computer software for emulating and working with handheld graphing calculators.
Many graphing calculators can be attached to devices like electronic thermometers, pH gauges, weather instruments, decibel and light meters, accelerometers, and other sensors and therefore function as data loggers, as well as WiFi or other communication modules for monitoring, polling and interaction with the teacher. Student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning of math, especially statistics and mechanics.
Since graphing calculators are usually readily user-programmable, such calculators are also widely used for gaming purposes, with a sizable body of user-created game software on most popular platforms. Even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range, graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games. However, for developers and advanced users like researchers, analysts and gamers, 3rd party software development involving firmware mods, whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language, is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school and college tests where these devices are targeted. Nowadays graduate (Masters) students and researchers have turned to advanced Computer Aided Math software for learning as well as experimenting.

[tpl]nihongo|Falco Lombardi|ファルコ・ランバルディ|Faruko Rambarudi[/tpl] is an anthropomorphic bird  character from the Star Fox series of video games. He was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and designed by Takaya Imamura. Falco acts as the wingman and friend of title character Fox McCloud for the majority of the series.
Falco first appeared in the 1993 video game Star Fox. Since then, he has appeared in multiple Star Fox games. A variety of voice actors lend their voice to the character in the English language releases, but Hisao Egawa portrays Falco in all Japanese language releases. Besides the Star Fox games, Falco has starred in his own manga, and also appeared as a playable character in two Super Smash Bros. titles.
Falco was based on the model designer of the original Star Fox game. Reception to the character has been mixed, with popularity among fans high. Falco has been mainly criticized for his appearance and contentious attitude, but praised for being far less annoying than other characters in the series. Reaction to his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl has been similarly mixed, with many reviewers objecting to his moveset being cloned from Fox, citing it as an example of low effort on the part of the developers.

The Wars of Alexander the Great were fought by King Alexander III of Macedon ("The Great"), first against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, under its "King of Kings" Darius III, and then against local chieftains and warlords as far east as Punjab, India. Alexander the Great was one of the most successful military commanders of all time. He was undefeated in battle. By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks.See, e.g., ac.wwu.edu

Ltd, ISBN 0-09-475270-2, p. 16.  After reconfirming Macedonian rule by quashing a rebellion of southern Greek city-states and staging a short but bloody excursion against Macedon's northern neighbors, Alexander set out east against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, under its "King of Kings" (the title all Achaemenid kings went by), Darius III, which he defeated and overthrew. His conquests included Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Gaza, Egypt, Bactria and Mesopotamia, and he extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as Punjab, India.
Alexander had already made more plans prior to his death for military and mercantile expansions into the Arabian peninsula, after which he was to turn his armies to the west (Carthage, Rome and the Iberian Peninsula). However, Alexander's diadochi quietly abandoned these grandiose plans after his death. Instead, within a few years of Alexander's death, the diadochi began fighting with each other, dividing up the Empire between themselves, and triggering 40 years of warfare.

The Sooty Shearwater (Puffinus griseus) is a medium-large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. In New Zealand it is also known by its Māori name tītī and as muttonbird, like its relatives the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (P. pacificus) and the Australian Short-tailed Shearwater (P. tenuirostris).
It appears to be particularly closely related to the Great ("P." gravis) and Short-tailed Shearwaters, all blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure. In any case, these three species are among the larger species of shearwater which might belong into a separate genus Ardenna.

Walters first became known as a television personality when she was a writer and segment producer of "women's interest stories" on the morning NBC News program The Today Show, where she began work with host Hugh Downs in 1962, once even modeling a swimsuit when an expected model did not show up. Because of her excellent interviewing ability and her popularity with the viewers, and when other women left the program, she was eventually allowed more air time. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the show, she had no input in choosing a successor for Hugh Downs when he left the show in 1971. Frank McGee was hired. Although his salary was twice hers,[tpl]cite book|last=Walters|first=Barbara|title=Audition: a memoir|year=2008|publisher=Knopf|location=NY|isbn=978-0-307-26646-0|page=205[/tpl] at Frank McGee's death in 1974, because of a clause added to her contract by her agent (a family friend),[tpl]cite book|last=Walters|first=Barbara|title=Audition: a memoir|year=2008|publisher=Knopf|location=NY|isbn=978-0-307-26646-0[/tpl] she acquired the title "co-host", the first woman by that title for any network news or public affairs program.[tpl]cite news|last=Meaney, VP-TV News Programming|first=Donald|title=NBC-TV Press Release|date=April 22, 1974[/tpl] Jim Hartz became her co-host.

From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as co-host and producer for the ABC newsmagazine 20/20, again appearing with Hugh Downs. From 1976 to 2010, she contributed as an anchor, reporter, and correspondent for ABC News, along with producing and hosting her own special interview programs several times yearly.

[[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)]]

CATEGORIES: 1987 soundtracks, Albums produced by Patrick Leonard, Film soundtracks, Madonna (entertainer) soundtracks, Sire Records soundtracks, Warner Bros. Records soundtracks, English-language soundtracks

Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a soundtrack album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, from the film of the same name, and was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also because they wanted to cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.
Madonna began working on the soundtrack in December 1986, and contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had worked as producers on her third studio album True Blue (1986). She felt that an uptempo song and a downtempo song were needed for the album. Leonard composed the music for the uptempo song, with Madonna providing the melody and lyrics. The singer named the track "Who's That Girl" and, believing this to be a better title than Slammer, changed the name of the film to the same. Together, Madonna and Leonard also developed the downtempo ballad "The Look of Love". Two more songs were composed for the film with Bray, the first being the dance-y tune "Causing a Commotion", and the other being "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas.
After its release, the Who's That Girl soundtrack received a mostly negative response from critics. Some reviews described the album as plain and incomplete, although the title track and "The Look of Love" were praised as its highlights. The soundtrack was a commercial success, reaching the top ten of the album charts of the United States, Austria, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom, while topping the charts of Germany, and European Album chart. The album went on to sell six million copies worldwide.
Three of the Madonna tracks were released as singles. The title track became her sixth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist to accumulate six number-one singles in the 1980s, and the first female performer to get that many number-ones as a solo act. "Causing a Commotion" was released as the second single, and reached number two on the Hot 100. "The Look of Love" was a European market-only release, reaching the top ten in United Kingdom. Another track, "Turn It Up" was a promotional release in United States, reaching number 15 on the dance charts. Who's That Girl received further promotion from the successful Who's That Girl World Tour.

[[Budget crisis]]
CATEGORIES: Economic problems, Fiscal policy, Government budgets

A budget crisis is an informal name for a situation in which the legislative and the executive in a presidential system deadlock and are unable to pass a budget. In presidential systems, the legislature has the power to pass a budget, but the executive often has a veto in which there are insufficient votes in the legislature to override. If no emergency provisions are made for the government's budget, a budget crisis may develop into a government shutdown in which the government temporarily suspends non-essential services until a budget is passed.
Unlike parliamentary systems, where a loss of supply would trigger the immediate fall of the government, a budget crisis can often lead to an extended stand-off. At the federal level in the United States, a crisis can often be averted by a continuing resolution which appropriates funding at the same level as the previous budget.
A budget crisis can also occur if the legislative branch has a constitutionally mandated dissolution or suspension date and the budget hasn't been passed up to that point. The term "budget crisis" could be used for situation then executive branch is freezing certain funds (impoundment) despite directions of the law on annual budget already passed by parliament.
Politically, a budget crisis may develop in a situation of disagreement between state and civil society. Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.

CRALOG was created after the American Council had dispatched a survey team to occupied Germany, which had reported back on the situation in February 1946. CRALOG was then on February 19, 1946 established and designated by the Truman administration in a directive on relief contributions to Germany as the only channel through which aid to the U.S. occupation zone could go.
The survey team had been permitted to visit Germany only after president Truman had been subjected to increased pressure both by congress and public. On January 1946 34 U.S. senators had petitioned that private relief organizations be allowed to help Germany and Austria, stating that the desperate food situation in occupied Germany "presents a picture of such frightful horror as to stagger the imagination, evidence which increasingly marks the United States as an accomplice in a terrible crime against humanity."Steven Bela Vardy and T.

The Governors of the Western Allied Occupation Zones in Germany signed contracts permitting CRALOG to provide relief in their respective zones as follows: General Lucius D. Clay, military governor of the U.S. occupation zone signed on  January 29, 1946, the UK governor signed on July 12, 1946 and the French on July 30, 1946. The Allied Kommandatura that jointly ruled Berlin signed in April 1947.Mennonite encyclopedia
A relief worker described the situation encountered in Germany in 1946 thus:
The first CRALOG shipment arrived in Bremen harbor in April 1946, and by the termination of the programme in 1962 it had dispatched 300,000 tons of aid to Germany.

[[Compressive strength]]
CATEGORIES: Materials science

In the study of strength of materials, the compressive strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size. It can be measured by plotting applied force against deformation in a testing machine. 
Some material fracture at their compressive strength limit; others deform irreversibly, so a given amount of deformation may be considered as the limit for compressive load. 
Compressive strength is a key value for design of structures. 
Compressive strength is often measured on a universal testing machine;  these  range from very small table-top systems  to ones with over 53 MN[tpl]Elucidate|date=January 2014[/tpl] capacity.[ref]

At its most prosaic, science fiction features an endless variety of sidearms, mostly variations on real weapons such as guns and swords. Among the best-known of these are the phaser used in the Star Trek television series, films and novels and the lightsaber or laser gun featured in the Star Wars movies, comics, novels and TV series.
In addition to entertainment value and purpose, themes of weaponry in science fiction sometimes touch on deeper concerns, often motivated by contemporary concerns of the outside world.

Each phase carries a sinusoidal alternating current whose phase is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period.

[[Marquess of Zetland]]

CATEGORIES: Marquessates in the Peerage of the United Kingdom

Marquess of Zetland is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 22 August 1892 for the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Earl of Zetland. Zetland is an archaic spelling of Shetland. The Dundas family descends from the wealthy Scottish businessman and Member of Parliament, Lawrence Dundas. In 1762 he was created a Baronet, of Kerse in the County of Linlithgow, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. The title was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his brother Thomas Dundas and the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Richmond and Stirling in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1794 he was created Baron Dundas, of Aske, North Yorkshire in the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Dundas notably purchased the right to the earldom of Orkney and lordship of Zetland from James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton.
His son, the second Baron, was a Member of Parliament for Richmond and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1838 he was created Earl of Zetland in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He also represented Richmond and York in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl.

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture]]
CATEGORIES: Anglo-Saxon architecture

Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England, and parts of Wales, from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066.  Anglo-Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. No universally accepted example survives above ground.
There are, however, many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features, with many more claiming to be, although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick, and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work.
The architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period; Early Christian basilica influenced architecture; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period, an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings.  In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom a more general Romanesque style was introduced from the Continent, as in the now built-over additions to Westminster Abbey made from 1050 onwards, already influenced by Norman style.  In recent decades architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor "Romanesque" features post-date the Norman Conquest.  Although once common, it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term "Saxon" for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain.
Early Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers or sited to serve as ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.York and London both offer examples of this trend.

An alternative approach is using dedicated I/O processors—commonly known as channels on mainframe computers—that execute their own instructions.
Memory-mapped I/O (not to be confused with memory-mapped file I/O) uses the same address bus to address both memory and I/O devices[tpl]snd[/tpl] the memory and registers of the I/O devices are mapped to (associated with) address values. So when an address is accessed by the CPU, it may refer to a portion of physical RAM, but it can also refer to memory of the I/O device. Thus, the CPU instructions used to access the memory can also be used for accessing devices. Each I/O device monitors the CPU's address bus and responds to any CPU access of an address assigned to that device, connecting the data bus to the desired device's hardware register. To accommodate the I/O devices, areas of the addresses used by the CPU must be reserved for I/O and must not be available for normal physical memory. The reservation might be temporary—the Commodore 64 could bank switch between its I/O devices and regular memory—or permanent.
Port-mapped I/O often uses a special class of CPU instructions specifically for performing I/O. This is found on Intel microprocessors, with the IN and OUT instructions. These instructions can read and write one to four bytes (outb, outw, outl) to an I/O device. I/O devices have a separate address space from general memory, either accomplished by an extra "I/O" pin on the CPU's physical interface, or an entire bus dedicated to I/O. Because the address space for I/O is isolated from that for main memory, this is sometimes referred to as isolated I/O.

[[Source code compatibility]]

CATEGORIES: Backward compatibility, Source code

Source code compatibility (source compatible) means that a program can run on computers (or operating systems), independently of binary code compatibility and that the source code is needed for portability.
The source code must be compiled before running, unless the computers can work as interpreters (this is the case of a few bytecode processors). Confusingly, sometimes the term is used for assembly language compatibility, where the source is already human-readable machine code but must be converted to executable code by an assembler. This is different from binary code compatibility, where no recompilation is needed.
Source-compatibility is a major issue in the developing of computer programs. For example, most Unix systems are source compatible, as long as one uses only standard libraries. Microsoft Windows systems are source compatible across one major family (NT, 2000, XP or 95, 98, ME), with partial source compatibility between the two families.

Sæmundur Sigfússon (or Sæmundur fróði) (Sæmundur the Learned) (1056–1133) was an Icelandic priest and scholar. Sæmundur is known to have studied abroad. Previously it has generally been held that he studied in France, but modern scholars rather believe his studies were carried out in Franconia. In Iceland he founded a long-lived school at Oddi. He was a member of the Oddaverjar clan and had the son Loftur Sæmundsson.
Sæmundur wrote a work, probably in Latin, on the history of Norwegian kings. The work is now lost but was used as a source by later authors, including Snorri Sturluson. The poem Nóregs konungatal summarizes Sæmundur's work. The authorship of the Poetic Edda, or, more plausibly, just the editor's role in the compilation, was traditionally attributed to Sæmundur but is not accepted today.
In Icelandic folklore, Sæmundur is a larger-than-life character who repeatedly tricks the Devil into doing his bidding.

Polidoro Virgili, commonly Latinised as Polydorus Vergilius, or anglicised as Polydore Vergil (or Virgil), and often known as Polydore Vergil of Urbino (c. 1470 – 18 April 1555) was an Italian humanist scholar, historian, priest and diplomat who spent most of his life in England. He is particularly remembered for his works the Proverbiorum libellus (1498), a collection of Latin proverbs; De inventoribus rerum (1499), a history of discoveries and origins; and the Anglica Historia (drafted by 1513; printed 1534), an influential history of England. He has been dubbed the "Father of English History".Galdieri 1993, pp. 316–17. This sobriquet has, of course, also been assigned to other historians, notably the Venerable Bede.
Vergil is sometimes referred to in contemporary documents as Polydore Vergil Castellensis or Castellen, and it has sometimes been assumed that he was a kinsman of his patron, Cardinal Adriano Castellesi. However, it is more likely that the alias simply indicates that he was in Castellesi's service.Hay 1952, p. 3.

Richard Pace (c. 1482 – 28 June 1536) was an English diplomat of the Tudor period.  He was educated at Winchester College under Thomas Langton, and later at Padua, at Bologna, and probably at the University of Oxford. In 1509, he accompanied Cardinal Christopher Bainbridge, Archbishop of York, to Rome, and he remained in the service of the Archbishop until that man's death by poisoning in 1514; he was instrumental in bringing the murderer to justice. In 1515, upon his return to England, he entered the service of Cardinal Wolsey where he was employed in diplomacy and espionage. In 1515, Pace became Wolsey's secretary and in 1516 a secretary of state. He was also collated Archdeacon of Dorset in 1514. holding the post until 1523.
In 1515, Wolsey sent Pace to urge the Swiss to attack France.  He was engaged in a lengthy negotiation with Emperor Maximillian I regarding Henry's support of the Emperor's activities against the French in northern Italy, but upon Wolsey's instructions, used the 100,000 florins deposited on his behalf in Antwerp to pay for Swiss soldiers. Maximillian wanted use of the funds, which he claimed had been promised to him by Henry, to levy troops in Switzerland and parts of the Austrian territories. Pace refused to act without direct orders from Henry, despite Maximillian's cajolery, demands, and frustration.Great Britain, Public Record Office, pp. xiii-xxiii. Following the Battle of Marignano, Pace was captured by the French and imprisoned for some time, but released in early spring.Great Britain, Public Record, pp. lxxix.
In 1519, Pace returned to Germany to discuss with the Prince-Electors the impending election of Maximillan's grandson Charles V to the imperial throne. He was made dean of St Paul's in 1519, holding the office until 1536. He was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and in 1521 he went to Venice with the object of winning the support of the republic for Wolsey, who was anxious at this time to become pope. At the end of 1526 he was recalled to England, having been appointed dean of Exeter (1522?–1527) and Dean of Salisbury (1523–1536) in his absence.
In February 1536, it was reported that Pace's mental imbecillity sic for many years past has interfered with the due government of the cathedralLetters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, ed. James Gairdner, vol. X, no. 328 and he died in 1536. During his latter years co-adjutors were appointed to help with his ecclesiastical duties.

The Xerces Blue (Glaucopsyche xerces) is an extinct species of butterfly in the gossamer-winged butterfly family, Lycaenidae. The species lived in coastal sand dunes of the Sunset District of San Francisco. The Xerces Blue is believed to be the first American butterfly species to become extinct as a result of loss of habitat caused by urban development. The last Xerces Blue was seen in either 1941[tpl]cite book |first1=J.S. |last1=Garth |first2=J.W. |last2=Tilden |title=California Butterflies |publisher=University of California Press |year=1986[/tpl] or 1943[tpl]cite book |first1=J.A. |last1=Powell |first2=C.L. |last2=Hogue |title=California Insects |publisher=University of California Press |year=1979[/tpl] on land that is part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
The species was first described and documented in 1852. It was characterized by blue wings with white spots. The butterfly's food plants belonged to the genera Lotus and Lupinus. Xerces probably associated with ants in its larval stages as part of a symbiotic relationship. One of the theories regarding the extinction of the species is that with human settlement in the Bay Area, new species of ant were introduced which slowly replaced the existing ant species within the butterfly's super habitat.
Efforts are on to reestablish related butterflies in the Xerces Blue's former habitat. The Palos Verdes Blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis) which is considered a Los Angeles cousin of the Xerces, is being reared in labs. A new Xerces-like subspecies of the Silvery Blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus) has been discovered as well.
An endangered invertebrate conservation group known as the Xerces Society is named after the Xerces Blue. The specific name derives from the French spelling of "Xerxes", the name of Persian kings Xerxes I and Xerxes II of the fifth century BC.
Xerces is also a group of XML software packages named after this butterfly.

William Elphinstone (1431 – 25 October 1514) was a Scottish statesman, Bishop of Aberdeen and founder of the University of Aberdeen.
He was born in Glasgow, and educated at the High School of Glasgow and then University of Glasgow, taking the degree of M.A. in 1452. After practising for a short time as a lawyer in the church courts, he was ordained a priest, becoming rector of St. Michael's Church, Trongate, Glasgow, in 1465. Four years later he went to continue his studies at the University of Paris, where he became reader in Canon law, and then, proceeding to Orléans, became lecturer in the university there.
Before 1474 he had returned to Scotland, and was made academic rector of the university, and official of the see of Glasgow. Further promotion followed, but soon more important duties were entrusted to Elphinstone, who was made Bishop of Ross in 1481. He was a member of the Parliament of Scotland, and was sent by James III of Scotland on diplomatic missions to Louis XI of France and Edward IV of England. In 1483 he was appointed Bishop of Aberdeen, although his consecration was delayed for four years; and he was sent on missions to England, both before and after the death of Richard III of England in 1485.
Although he regularly attended the meetings of parliament he continued with his episcopal duties, and maintained the fabric of the cathedral. Early in 1488 he was made Lord High Chancellor, but on the king's death in the following June he left office, and retired to Aberdeen. As a diplomat, his services were quickly required by the new king, James IV of Scotland, in whose interests he visited the kings of England and France, and the German king, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.
Having been made Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1492, and having arranged a dispute between the Scots and the Dutch, Elphinstone's later years were mainly spent in the foundation of the University of Aberdeen. The papal bull was obtained in 1494, and the royal charter which made Aberdeen the seat of a university is dated 1498. A small endowment was provided by the king. The university, modelled on that of Paris and intended principally as a law school, soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, Hector Boece, the first rector. The building of the college of the Holy Virgin in Nativity, now King's College, was completed in 1506. Elphinstone also built the central tower of St Machar's Cathedral, and funded the building of the first stone bridge over the River Dee.[tpl]cite web|title=The Building Bishops of St Machar's|url=http://www.stmachar.com/building_biships.html|work=St Machar's Cathedral People and History|publisher=The Cathedral Church of St Machar|accessdate=14 February 2011[/tpl] Continuing to participate in public affairs he opposed the policy of hostility towards England which led to the Battle of Flodden in September 1513. He died in Edinburgh.
Elphinstone was partly responsible for the introduction of printing into Scotland, and for the production of the Breviarium Aberdonense. He may have written some of the lives in this collection, and gathered together materials concerning the history of Scotland.

Its goal was to drive a wedge between the Egyptian forces along the coast and the Beersheba–Hebron–Jerusalem road and ultimately to conquer the whole Negev. Operation Yoav was headed by the Southern Front commander Yigal Allon. The operation was named after Yitzhak Dubno, codenamed "Yoav" by his commanders in the Palmach. Dubno, a senior Palmach officer, was charged with planning and leading the defense of the kibbutzim Negba and Yad Mordechai.  Dubno was killed in an air raid on Kibbutz Negba shortly after Egyptian forces began their offensive on Israel's southern front.

He is the host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a satirical news show in which Colbert portrays a caricatured version of conservative political pundits. On April 10, 2014, Colbert was chosen to succeed David Letterman as the host of the Late Show on CBS after Letterman retires in 2015.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/04/10/stephen-colbert-taking-over-david-lettermans-late-night-spot/ | title=Stephen Colbert Leaving Character Behind To Take Over David Letterman's Late-Night Spot | work=Forbes | date=April 10, 2014| accessdate= April 10, 2014[/tpl]
Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the sketch comedy series Exit 57.
Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. His work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series The Daily Show first introduced him to a wide audience.
In 2005, he left The Daily Show to host a spin-off series, The Colbert Report.

[[Chamaesaura]]

CATEGORIES: Spinytail lizards

The Chamaesaura, also known as Grass Lizards, are a genus of legless lizards from southern and eastern Africa.  The limbs are reduced to small spikes.    The elongate shape and lack of limbs allows them to "swim" through grass.  They are viviparous and eat small invertebrates, especially grasshoppers.

[[Cordylus]]

CATEGORIES: Spinytail lizards

The genus Cordylus (Sauria: Cordylidae) includes a wide variety of small- to medium-sized spiny lizards from Africa, collectively called girdle-tailed or girdled lizards. All are diurnal and ovoviviparous (live-bearing, without shelled eggs). Most species are rupicolous (rock-dwelling), while a few species are arboreal or live in burrows. They defend themselves with osteoderms (flat bony plates in the skin) and by quickly retreating into rock crevices or burrows. Many species live in groups and males defend territories.  
Cordylids are generally listed under CITES Appendix II. They are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but trade is controlled to prevent overexploitation. Some species of Cordylus have limited ranges and may be threatened with habitat destruction or over collecting for the pet trade.

[[Pseudocordylus]]

CATEGORIES: Spinytail lizards

The Crag Lizards (Pseudocordylus) are small to large girdled lizards from South Africa.  Six species of Pseudocordylus are known; they are distinguished from other Cordylus by the presence of granular scales on the back instead of osteoderms.  Recent molecular data places Pseudocordylus within Cordylus.http://research.amnh.org/scicomp/pdfs/Frost_etal2001a.pdf

[[Ski boot]]
CATEGORIES: Boots, Sports footwear, Skiing equipment

Ski boots are specialized footwear that are used in skiing to provide a way to attach the skier to skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow.
Ski boots were originally made of leather and resembled standard winter boots. As skiing became more specialized as a form of recreation, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing (downhill) and cross-country skiing. The latter remain similar to standard footwear, but include an attachment point for the bindings near the toe. The former have become much more specialized, rising up the leg in order to transmit sideways rotations of the legs through the bindings and into the skis, a process known as "edging". A variety of techniques combine features of cross-country and downhill, notably Randoneé, and Telemark, and have led to further customization of boot styles to fill these niches.

According to Bandai, the name is a portmanteau combining the Japanese word "たまご" (tamago), which means "egg", and the English word "watch" (ウオッチ - uotchi).バンダイ タイムマシンバンダイ マシン (Older archived version) Consequently, the name is romanized as "Tamagotch" without the "i" in Japan. But recently in Japan, the romanized name has changed to the English "Tamagotchi" with the i.
Most Tamagotchi characters' names end in 'tchi' or 'っち' in Japanese, with the exception of a few newer characters, such as Makiko.

Various other previously used techniques and devices were instrumental as well, such as area bombing, Pathfinders, and H2S radar, which came together to work with particular effectiveness. An early form of chaff, code named 'Window', was successfully used for the first time by the RAF - clouds of shredded tinfoil dropped by Pathfinders as well as the initial bomber stream - in order to completely cloud German radar. The raids inflicted severe damage to German armaments production in Hamburg.

Islom Abdug‘aniyevich Karimov (Cyrillic Uzbek: Ислом Абдуғаниевич Каримов; Russian: Ислам Абдуганиевич Каримов, Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov; born January 30, 1938) is  the first President of Uzbekistan, having held this position since 1991.
Karimov was placed in an orphanage in Samarkand at birth, grew up to study economics and engineering at school.http://www.engology.com/eng5karimov.htm He became an official in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, becoming the party's First Secretary in Uzbekistan in 1989. On March 24, 1990 he became President of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Karimov's election to the Uzbek Communist Party resulted after his predecessor Rafik Nishanov failed to quell inter-ethnic clashes and instability in the Fergana region.Gulsen Aydin, Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi, "Authoritarianism versus democracy in Uzbekistan: domestic and international factors", (Ankara: METU, 2004) He declared Uzbekistan an independent nation on August 31, 1991 and subsequently won Uzbekistan's first presidential election on December 29, 1991, with 86% of the vote. The election was called unfair[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl], with state-run propaganda and a falsified vote count, although the opposing candidate and leader of the Erk (Freedom) Party, Muhammad Salih, had a chance to participate. Karimov permitted the participation of the opposition organizations Birlik ("Unity") and the Islamic Renaissance Party until his efforts to consolidate power over Shukrullo Mirsaidov, a former Communist Party elite who had originally supported Karimov's rise to the Party presidency. The period of political thaw was brief; Karimov began to complicate the registration process of opposition parties during elections. As Birlik grew in strength as a "popular movement", it was denied the ability to register as a "political party" without the required 60,000 signatures. The Karimov government allowed Birlik one day to gather these signatures, 25,000 of which they rejected. Karimov effectively took authoritarian measures to block any meaningful opposition.Gulsen Aydin, Orta Dogu Teknik Universitesi, "Authoritarianism versus democracy in Uzbekistan: domestic and international factors", (Ankara: METU, 2004), p. 41.

Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 and is headquartered at 200 West Street in the Lower Manhattan area of New York City, with additional offices in international financial centers. The firm provides mergers and acquisitions advice, underwriting services, asset management, and prime brokerage to its clients, which include corporations, governments and individuals.

It is recognized as one of the premier investment banks in the world,"Goldman Named 'The Most Prestigious European Bank' by Vault.com"."Goldman Number 1 in Prestige Rankings by Vault.com". but has sparked a great deal of controversy over its alleged improper practices, including the loosening of financial industry underwriting guidelines which had been intact since the 1930s, and in particular its actions since the 2007–2012 global financial crisis."'Since the Depression, there were strict underwriting guidelines that Wall Street adhered to when taking a company public,' says one prominent hedge-fund manager. 'The company had to be in business a minimum of five years, and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. But Wall Street took these guidelines and threw them in the trash.' Goldman completed the snow job by pumping up the sham stocks. 'Their analysts were out there saying Bullshit.com is worth $100 a share.' The problem was, nobody had told investors that the rules had changed. 'Everyone on the inside knew,' the manager said. 'Bob Rubin sure as hell knew what the underwriting standards were.

Claude Simon ([tpl]IPA-fr|simɔ̃|lang[/tpl]; 10 October 1913 – 6 July 2005) was a French novelist and the 1985 Nobel Laureate in Literature. He was born in Antananarivo, Madagascar, and died in Paris, France.
His parents were French, his father being a career officer who was killed in the First World War. He grew up with his mother and her family in Perpignan in the middle of the wine district of Roussillon. 
Among his ancestors was a general from the time of the French Revolution.
After secondary school at Collège Stanislas in Paris and brief sojourns at Oxford and Cambridge he took courses in painting at the André Lhote Academy. He then travelled extensively through Spain, Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Greece. This experience as well as those from the Second World War show up in his literary work. At the beginning of the war Claude Simon took part in the battle of the Meuse (1940) and was taken prisoner. He managed to escape and joined the resistance movement. At the same time he completed his first novel, Le Tricheur ("The Cheat", published in 1946), which he had started to write before the war.
He lived in Paris and used to spend part of the year at Salses in the Pyrenees.
In 1961 Claude Simon received the prize of L'Express for La Route des Flandres and in 1967 the Médicis prize for Histoire. The University of East Anglia made him honorary doctor in 1973.

Henrik Pontoppidan (24 July 1857 – 21 August 1943) was a Danish realist writer who shared with Karl Gjellerup the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1917 for "his authentic descriptions of present-day life in Denmark." Pontoppidan's novels and short stories — informed with a desire for social progress but despairing, later in his life, of its realization — present an unusually comprehensive picture of his country and his epoch. As a writer he was an interesting figure, distancing himself both from the conservative environment in which he was brought up and from his socialist contemporaries and friends. He was the youngest and in many ways the most original and influential member of the Modern Break-Through.

Jacinto Benavente y Martínez (12 August 1866 – 14 July 1954) was one of the foremost Spanish dramatists of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1922.
Born in Madrid, the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics.
A liberal monarchist and a critic of Socialism, he was a reluctant supporter of the Franco regime as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931–1936. Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona (Toledo) at the age of 87. He never married.

Her best-known play is Eli: Ein Mysterienspiel vom Leiden Israels (1950); other works include the poems "Zeichen im Sand" (1962), "Verzauberung" (1970), and the collections of poetry In den Wohnungen des Todes (1947), Flucht und Verwandlung (1959), Fahrt ins Staublose (1961), and Suche nach Lebenden (1971).

The Southern New England Telephone Company (commonly referred to as SNET by its customers) is a local exchange carrier owned by AT&T Inc. It started operations on January 27, 1878 as the District Telephone Company of New Haven. It was the founder of the first telephone exchange, as well as the world's first telephone book. Since its inception, SNET has held a monopoly on most of the telephone services in the state of Connecticut; the only remaining exception is the Greenwich and Byram exchanges where Verizon New York provides telephone service.AT&T SNET Fairfield County White Pages, Customer Service Guide page 14, "Local Toll-free Calling Areas", August 2006 edition
SNET and Cincinnati Bell were the only two companies in the old Bell System that the old AT&T only had a minority stake in; by 1983, AT&T's stake was only 19.6 percent. Therefore, neither is considered a Bell Operating Company; rather, they are considered independents.
The Southern New England Telephone Company was purchased for $ 4.4 Billion in 1998 by SBC Communications, which subsequently purchased the old AT&T, taking its name as the "new" AT&T. The Southern New England Telephone Company currently does business as AT&T Connecticut.
In 2006, AT&T merged the operations of Southern New England Telecommunications into AT&T Teleholdings. Southern New England Telephone then became a subsidiary of the company originally known as Ameritech within the AT&T corporate structure.
On June 1, 2007, the operations of Woodbury Telephone were merged into Southern New England Telephone. Woodbury Telephone is now defunct.

[[Deinopidae]]

CATEGORIES: Deinopidae

The spider family Deinopidae consists of stick-like elongate spiders that build unusual webs that they suspend between the front legs. When prey approaches, the spider will stretch the net to two or three times its relaxed size and propel itself onto the prey, entangling it in the web. Because of this, they are also called net-casting spiders.
Their excellent night-vision adapted posterior median eyes allow them to cast this net over potential prey items. These eyes are so large in comparison to the other six eyes that the spider seems to have only two eyes.
The genus Deinopis is the best known in this family. Spiders in this genus are also called ogre-faced spiders, due to the imagined similarity between their appearance and that of the mythological creature, the ogre. It is distributed nearly worldwide in the tropics, from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, Deinopis often hangs upside-down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. It emerges at night to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey.
The genus Menneus is also known as "humped-back spider", and Avellopsis as "camel-backed spider".
The entire family is cribellate.Coddington, J.A. & Levi, H.W. (1991). Systematics and Evolution of Spiders (Araneae). Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 22:565-592

[[Sugar Bowl]]
CATEGORIES: Sugar Bowl, Sports in Louisiana, Sports in New Orleans, Louisiana

The Sugar Bowl is an annual American college football bowl game played in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Sugar Bowl has been played annually since January 1, 1935, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on January 2, 2009. The Sugar Bowl, along with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl, are the second-oldest bowl games in the country, behind the Rose Bowl. 
The Sugar Bowl is also a member of the Bowl Championship Series. Presently, its official title is the Allstate Sugar Bowl after its current sponsor.
The Sugar Bowl has had a longstanding--albeit not exclusive--relationship with the Southeastern Conference (which once had a member based in New Orleans, Tulane University; another Louisiana school, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, is still in the SEC today).  From 1950—1995, only once did the Sugar Bowl not feature an SEC team.  That relationship has been altered over the past twenty years due to conference realignments and the emergence of a series of coalitions and alliances intending to produce an undisputed national champion in college football, but the ties between the Sugar Bowl and the SEC have persisted and have recently been strengthened.  Starting in January 2015, the Sugar Bowl game will be in a three-year rotation with the Rose, Orange, Cotton, Chick-fil-A, and Fiesta Bowls where they'll host a semifinal game the first year and feature the SEC and Big 12 conference champions the next two, an arrangement nearly identical with the relationship between the Rose Bowl and the champions of the Big Ten and Pac-12. Coincidentally, the SEC added two former Big 12 members in 2012 - Missouri and Texas A&M.
As a member of the Bowl Championship Series, the Sugar Bowl hosted the BCS National Championship Game twice (2000 and 2004). However, from the 2006 season to the 2013 season, the BCS National Championship Game had been a stand-alone event, following one week after the New Year's Day bowl games. This means that, under the now-defunct BCS format, no traditional bowl game hosted the BCS National Championship Game, but that game was played at the venue of one of those traditional major bowls, rotating amongst the four sites, including the Superdome.
The payout for the 2006 game was $14–17 million per participating team.  According to Sports Illustrated, the 2007 salary for Sugar Bowl CEO Paul Hoolahan was $607,500.Murphy, Austin, and Dan Wetzel, "Does It Matter?", Sports Illustrated, 15 November 2010, p. 45.

Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios.  Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon, it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story.
Woody is stolen by a toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him.  However, Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting.  Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story returned for this sequel, and several new characters, including Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson), and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Estelle Harris), were introduced.
Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel. Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998).  When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend.  Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.
Despite production struggles, Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $485 million, and highly positive critical reviews. Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics and audiences alike to be one of few sequels that outshine the original, and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made.  The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release.  The film's success led to the production of Toy Story 3 in 2010, which was also highly successful.

The Sun Bowl is an annual U.S. college football bowl game that is usually played at the end of December in El Paso, Texas. The Sun Bowl, along with the Sugar Bowl and the Orange Bowl are the second-oldest bowl games in the country, behind the Rose Bowl (first played 1902, played annually since 1916). In most of its early history, the game pitted the champion of the Border Conference against an at-large opponent. Games are now played at Sun Bowl stadium on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. The first three were played at El Paso High School stadium (1935–1937), then switched to Kidd Field until the present stadium was ready in 1963. For its first 24 years of existence the game was played on January 1 (New Year's Day) or January 2; since then, with the exception of a January 2 game in 1977, the game has been played in December with the last 15 games played on or near December 31.
The game's current full title is the Hyundai Sun Bowl, which became the name after Hyundai Motor Company's American subsidiary bought naming rights to the bowl from Helen of Troy Limited on June 24, 2010. Hyundai becomes the fourth title sponsor of the Sun Bowl, after Helen of Troy (through its Vitalis and Brut brands), Norwest/Wells Fargo, and John Hancock Insurance; the bowl was known as the John Hancock Bowl for the last five years of the firm's contract with the bowl. Hyundai signed a four-year contract with the Sun Bowl committee, which runs through the 2013 game.
Beginning in 2013, the Sun Bowl matches the Pac-12 Conference against the ACC. The Sun Bowl will have the fourth selection after the BCS from the Pac-12 and either the ACC Championship Game runner-up or the third pick after the BCS from the ACC. With the most recent agreement with the Sun Bowl the ACC keeps its Sun Bowl ties for at least four more years; the most recent prior Sun Bowl agreement was done in conjunction with the Gator Bowl, where the ACC, Big East, and Big XII conferences (as well as Notre Dame) had a rotating arrangement with the two bowls. 
The 1992 game was the final head coaching appearance of College Football Hall of Famer (and future AFCA Executive Director) Grant Teaff of Baylor.   Teaff's Bears won over Arizona.
The 1940 Sun Bowl set the record for fewest points scored, when the Arizona State Sun Devils played the Catholic University Cardinals to a 0–0 tie.

Juan Sánchez Vidal (born January 3, 1958) is a world renowned model aircraft collector. Sánchez Vidal, born in the Palma de Mallorca, has over one thousand commercial airline models, a collection which many experts believe to be the largest aircraft collection in the world.
Sánchez Vidal began working with defunct Spanish airline Spantax, acquiring his first model, a Convair CV-990 of that airline, in 1973. He made friendships with co-workers of other airlines, and he began receiving more models.
Eventually, his hobby led him to meet some airline personalities, some of them famous celebrities, like Niki Lauda, Formula One champion and owner of Lauda Air. The largest model in his collection, a model of an Air France Airbus A320, was obtained after he traded one of his planes with a local Air France worker who also collects models. He also made a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 model of Air Europa, airline for which he works now. Air Europa never actually used this type of aircraft in real life.
He also has models of American Airlines' Boeing 757 and Boeing 767, the same type of aircraft used for the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Sánchez Vidal and his collection have been the objects of many reports and interviews by many specialized magazines.
In 2000, personnel at Barajas International Airport in Madrid negotiated with Sánchez Vidal so that he could display his collection at the international arrivals terminal of that airport. In March of that year, his collection began being showcased at that airport. The collection lasted there until 2003.

The Capital One Bowl is an annual college football bowl game played in Orlando, Florida at the Citrus Bowl.  It was previously known as the Tangerine Bowl (1947–1982) and the Florida Citrus Bowl (1983–2002). Financial services company Capital One has been the title sponsor of the bowl since 2001 when it was the Capital One Florida Citrus Bowl but with the exclusive Capital One Bowl moniker since 2003. The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group which also organizes the Russell Athletic Bowl and Florida Classic.
Since becoming one of the premier bowls, the Capital One Bowl is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on January 1, New Year's Day, immediately before the Rose Bowl, both of which have been televised on ESPN since 2011. (In years when New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2 to avoid conflicting with the National Football League schedule.) In 2004, the Capital One Bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. On July 26, 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted 5–2 in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build a new arena for the Orlando Magic, a performing arts center, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl.
Currently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the BCS for both conferences.

CATEGORIES: All-American Bowl, Defunct college football bowls, Sports in Birmingham, Alabama, American football in Alabama

The All-American Bowl was an annual postseason  college football bowl game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama from 1977 to 1990. The game was known as the Hall of Fame Classic from 1977 to 1985.Foldesy, Jody. "Bowls burgeon as big business", The Washington Times. December 21, 1997. Page A1.
In the spring of 1986, the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame decided to relocate the Hall of Fame Bowl game to Tampa beginning in December 1986. The game in Birmingham continued for five years under a different name and organizing body. When the Southeastern Conference expanded to twelve schools and began contesting a championship game in 1992, Birmingham officials chose to host the conference title game and abandon the All-American Bowl. The SEC championship was moved to Atlanta's Georgia Dome two years later, leaving Legion Field without any Division I-A postseason college football until 2006, when the NCAA agreed to hold a new post-season game the Papajohns.com Bowl (now the BBVA Compass Bowl), proposed by ESPN.

"The Long and Winding Road" is a ballad written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney). It is the tenth track on the Beatles' album Let It Be. It became the group's 20th and last number-one song in the United States on 13 June 1970,[tpl]sfn|Whitburn|2000[/tpl] and was the last single released by the quartet while all four remained alive. "The Long and Winding Road" was listed with "For You Blue" as a double-sided hit when the single hit number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1970.
While the released version of the song was very successful, the post-production modifications to the song by producer Phil Spector angered McCartney to the point that when he made his case in court for breaking up the Beatles as a legal entity, McCartney cited the treatment of "The Long and Winding Road" as one of six reasons for doing so. New versions of the song with simpler instrumentation were subsequently released by both the Beatles and McCartney.

RS-422 (also EIA-422) is a technical standard originated by the Electronic Industries Alliance that specifies electrical characteristics of a digital signaling circuit. Differential signaling can transmit data at rates as high as 10 Mbit/s, or may be sent on cables as long as 1500 meters. Some systems directly interconnect using RS-422 signals, or RS-422 converters may be used to extend the range of RS-232 connections.  The standard only defines signal levels; other properties of a serial interface, such as electrical connectors and pin wiring, are set by other standards.

BellSouth was one of the seven original Regional Bell Operating Companies after the U.S. Department of Justice forced the American Telephone & Telegraph Company to divest itself of its regional telephone companies on January 1, 1984.
In a merger announced on March 5, 2006 and executed on December 29, 2006, AT&T Inc.

The merger consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless and YELLOWPAGES.COM, both of which were joint ventures between BellSouth and AT&T.
With the merger completed, wireless services previously offered by Cingular Wireless are now offered under the AT&T name. In addition, BellSouth has formally become AT&T South, its Bell Operating Company doing business as AT&T Southeast, and ceased doing business under the BellSouth name on June 30, 2007.
BellSouth was the last of the Regional Bell Operating Companies to keep its original corporate name after the 1984 AT&T breakup, as well as the last one to retain the Bell logo as part of its main corporate identity.
BellSouth also operated in the Australian and New Zealand market. BellSouth operated in New Zealand under the name of BellSouth New Zealand Limited from 1993 until 1998 when it was acquired by Vodafone to become Vodafone New Zealand.http://www.vodafone.co.nz/about/#history Vodafone acquires BellSouth NZ It competed against Telecom New Zealand.

Wigger is a slang term for a white person who emulates mannerisms, language, and fashions associated with African-American culture, particularly hip hop, and in Britain the Grime scene.Bernstein, Nell: Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers, 5th ed. 607 The term is a portmanteau of white and nigger.  
The term may be considered derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American or Black British culture. The wannabe connotation may be used pejoratively, implying a failed attempt at cultural appropriation by a white subject. It is also sometimes used in a racist manner, not only belittling the person perceived as "acting black", but also demeaning black people and culture, by proxy. 
Most, however, use the term neutrally, or as a light joke, without any racism intended. It has also been used as a self-description by proponents of a "wigger" subculture.[tpl]cite news | author=Wimsatt, William Upski | title= Wigger: Confessions of a White Wannabe | publisher=Chicago Reader | accessdate= 2012-07-07 | url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/wigger/Content?oid=884951 [/tpl]
Historically, the term "White Nigger" has been used in Northern Ireland to refer to the Roman Catholics, and also to Irish Catholic immigrants to the United States and their descendants. Today, the term may be considered derogatory to Irish-Americans.The IRA 12th impression, Tim Pat Coogan, page 448, William Collins, Sons & Co., Glasgow, 1987

USS ''Ticonderoga'' (CV/CVA/CVS-14) was one of 24 [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier[/tpl]s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ticonderoga was commissioned in May 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning five battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the Korean War, but was very active in the Vietnam War, earning three Navy Unit Commendations, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and 12 battle stars.
Ticonderoga differed somewhat from the earlier [tpl]Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier|0[/tpl] ships in that she was [tpl]convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] longer to accommodate bow-mounted anti-aircraft guns.

Future passenger stock orders – including contracts R4, R6, R7, R7A, and R9 – were virtually identical, with minor mechanical and cosmetic variations. Therefore, these car classes are frequently referred to collectively as Arnines, or R1-9s.

[[Hua (state)]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient peoples of China

Huáguó (滑国) was a vassal state of Western Zhou that existed in what is now Henan, whose ruling elites belonged to the royal family but which was destroyed by the State of Qin in 627 BC[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]. The population were the earlier Hua of the Spring and Autumn Period not the later Huá (滑) of the Hephthalites. The Huaguo in northern Henan was destroyed by Qin Shi Huang, and the Hua tribe sought refuge in Shanxi. They became part of the Xiongnu at Pingyang (平陽, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). When Liu Can was overthrown by Jin Zhun, and Shi Le established his state, many of the Huá (滑) around Pingyang fled west along the Silk Road causing the Xionites to harass Persia -though Pingyang remains the centre of the Huá (滑) clan even today. They later appear in the Qeshi region (Turpan area) under the Rouran. 
The word guo can be interpret as state or tribe, which depend on different cases, some of the problem including, perhaps vague in meaning, taking for example the Samhan which mentioned in the Records of Three Kingdoms consisted of seventy eight guo, where guo here could have been translated differently. Thus ([tpl]zh|c=滑国|p=Huáguó[/tpl]), the State of Huá (滑), can refer to the name of the Hephthalites' country or tribes mentioned in what is now north Afghanistan from the Book of Liang and Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang. However, Malyavkin (1989) insists that the Hephthalite country was called Yeda by the Chinese, and only the polity was called Hua.
In modern times, Huá (滑) refers to the southernmost county of Anyang, the northernmost prefecture-level city of Henan.

[[Arran distillery]]

CATEGORIES: 1995 establishments in Scotland, Isle of Arran, Scottish malt whisky

Arran distillery is a whisky distillery in Lochranza, Scotland, the only distillery on the Isle of Arran. In 1994 Arran Distillers was founded by Harold Currie, former director of Chivas with the intention of building a distillery on Arran.[tpl]cite book|isbn=9057642360|title=The single malt companion|author=Helen Arthur|publisher=Libero|year=2002|origyear=1997|others=Lisbeth Machielsen (translator)|language=dutch|page=196[/tpl] During the construction of the distillery, a pair of Golden Eagles built their nest on a cliff near the distillery; since Golden Eagles are a protected species, construction of the distillery was temporarily halted. The distillery opened in 1995.
There used to be about fifty distilleries on the island, but most of them were "moonlight" or illegal distilleries.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] The most recent legally founded distillery on Arran, called 'Lagg', closed in 1837.
Until recently a proportion of the casks were stored in the warehouses of Springbank, due to a lack of room in the distillery, and the legal impossibility of extending the current warehouses at the Arran distillery. However, the distillery now has a revolutionary storage warehouse, on site, that allows easier access to barrels.  
The distillery offers a cask purchase scheme which offers private individuals the opportunity to own their own cask of whisky, which can be stored on site at the distillery.
The Arran Distillery is a patron of the World Burns Federation and as such has created a Robert Burns Single Malt and Robert Burns Blended Whisky in honour of Scotland's National Poet. They are the only whisky distillery to be able to use the image and signature of Robert Burns on their packaging.
The whisky of Arran is mostly used to produce their Single Malt Whisky, but a small proportion also goes into the production of their range of blended whiskies : Lochranza Blend, Robert Burns Blend and Arran Gold Single Malt Whisky Cream Liqueur.
The Arran Distillery is now owned by a group of private shareholders and the Managing Director is Euan Mitchell. 2010 saw the release of a 15th Anniversary bottling on the occasion of the Distillery Open Day on 3 July. Autumn 2010 also saw the release of the first official 14 year-old to be released by the Distillery. The first peated Arran Single Malt (called Machrie Moor) is now available since December 8, 2010.

[[Erotophobia]]
CATEGORIES: Phobias, Non-sexuality, Sexual and gender prejudices, Sexuality and society

Erotophobia is a term coined by a number of researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe one pole on a continuum of attitudes and beliefs about sexuality. The model of the continuum is a basic polarized line, with erotophobia (fear of sex or negative attitudes about sex) at one end and erotophilia (positive feelings/attitudes about sex) at the other end.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fischer|first=W.A.|coauthors=Byrne, White & Kelley|title=Erotophobia-erotophilia as a dimension of personality|journal=Journal of Sex Research|year=1988|volume=25|pages=123–151[/tpl]
The word erotophobia is derived from the name of Eros, the Greek god of erotic love, and Phobos, Greek (φόβος) for "fear".

[[Dutton Speedwords]]

CATEGORIES: Shorthand systems, Constructed languages, International auxiliary languages

Dutton Speedwords, sometimes called rapmotz, is an international auxiliary language as well a shorthand writing system. It was invented by Reginald J. G. Dutton (1886–1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935 under the title International Symbolic Script and a year later using the name Speedwords. Revisions were made and published in 1946 and 1951.
The dual function of being both an international language and a shorthand system was intended as a way of encouraging more people to see the value of the method. The original Dutton Speedwords manuals are now out of print, but the method has seen a revival since the start of the 21st century, as its applications on online work have become noted, such as the benefit of using a shorthand method for typing e-mail.
Unlike other shorthand methods, such as Pitman's shorthand, the Speedwords method uses ordinary Roman letters to represent the semantic qualities of words rather than using new symbols. This not only makes it easier to learn[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl], but means it can be typed using a normal keyboard.
The vocabulary of Speedwords uses many international words and compressed forms of the writer's own language. 
Dutton conceived Speedwords not only as a system of shorthand but as an auxiliary spoken language; thus, he also provided rules of pronunciation. As a written system only, it is interesting to compare Speedwords to the shorthands used in mobile phone text messages.
The principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see information theory). Thus, there are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. For example, the top twelve most frequently used English words are listed below with their single-letter Dutton Speedword equivalents:
Some two- and three-letter words are
(Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from Latin roots —sapio, amo, bellus, lingua, ludus—as are "room" and "sleep" below—camera and dormio—while "good" and the root for "air" below come from German: gut, luft.)
The few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix -a indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, bixy = kill, bixya = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ky + luf (eat + air) to mean "picnic". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter  r indicates future tense and y indicates past. Thus,  j sa = I know, j ysa = I knew, j r sa = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (bel = "beautiful" and "beautifully"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ca + dor (room + sleep) = bedroom.

[[Education in England]]

CATEGORIES: Education in England, Secondary education by country

Education in England is overseen by the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Local authorities (LAs) take responsibility for implementing policy for public education and state schools at a local level.
The education system is divided into early years (ages 3–4), primary education (ages 4–11), secondary education (ages 11–18) and tertiary education (ages 18+).
Full-time education is compulsory for all children aged between 5 and 17 (from 2013, and up to 18 from 2015), either at school or otherwise, with a child beginning primary education during the school year he or she turns 5.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogalinski.com.pl/jezyki-obce/schools-in-britain/ |title=Schools in the Great Britain |publisher=Rogalinski.com | accessdate=7 January 2012[/tpl] Students may then continue their secondary studies for a further two years (sixth form), leading most typically to A-level qualifications, although other qualifications and courses exist, including Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC) qualifications, the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge Pre-U. The leaving age for compulsory education was raised to 18 by the Education and Skills Act 2008. The change takes effect in 2013 for 16-year-olds and 2015 for 17-year-olds.Education and Skills Act 2008, Office of Public Sector Information. State-provided schooling and sixth form education is paid for by taxes. England also has a tradition of independent schooling, but parents may choose to educate their children by any suitable means.
Higher education often begins with a three-year bachelor's degree. Postgraduate degrees include master's degrees, either taught or by research, and the doctorate, a research degree that usually takes at least three years. Universities require a Royal Charter in order to issue degrees, and all but one are financed by the state via tuition fees, which cost up to £9,000 per academic year for English, Welsh and EU students.

Mostly due to the rescheduling of the tournament on short notice, FIFA and the United States Soccer Federation were forced to creatively schedule matches. Nine doubleheaders were scheduled in group play (similar to the 1999 format). They also had to abandon the modern practice of scheduling the final matches of the group stage to kick off simultaneously. In Groups A and D, the final matches were scheduled as the two ends of a doubleheader. The final matches in Groups B and C were also scheduled as doubleheaders, but split between two cities, with a Group B match in each city followed by a Group C match. The four quarterfinals were also scheduled as two doubleheaders, and both semifinals were also a doubleheader.[tpl]cite news|author=Jere Longman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/17/sports/soccer-the-group-dynamics-of-the-women-s-world-cup.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=SOCCER; The Group Dynamics of the Women's World Cup - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=17 Sep 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl]

[[Parsnip]]
CATEGORIES: Edible Apiaceae, Invasive plant species, Medicinal plants, Root vegetables, Plants described in 1753

The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh and can be left in the ground when mature as it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time the stem is woody and the tuber inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat and winged.
The parsnip is native to Eurasia. It has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by the Romans, although there is some confusion in the literature of the time between parsnips and carrots. It was used as a sweetener before the arrival in Europe of cane sugar. It was introduced into the United States in the nineteenth century.
The parsnip is usually cooked but can also be eaten raw. It is high in vitamins and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils and is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. In sunlight, handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash.

[[Nosaltres, els valencians]]

CATEGORIES: Catalan literature, Essay collections, 1962 works

Nosaltres, els valencians ([tpl]IPA-ca|noˈza(ɫ)tɾes, eɫz valensiˈans|va[/tpl]; "We, the Valencians"), is a historical and political essay by the Valencian (Spain) author Joan Fuster, first published in 1962.
The book deals with Valencians, especially their national identity and their relationship with Spain, Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking community as a whole. It does so from an ardourous Catalanism.
The fact that it represented the first solid intellectual effort in the twentieth century to construct an overview of the past and the present of Valencians from a Catalanist point of view explains its relevance and controversy back in the day.
It was because of the novelty of this new Catalanist paradigm, consisting of Catalanism made from Valencia, that the book caused a stir in the Valencian Francoist establishment and, with the advent of democracy in Spain, still remained deeply controversial for its uncompromising views.
Nosaltres, els valencians marked the dawn of Valencian nationalism in its modern formulation. It was also the main force behind a revival of the Països Catalans idea and, with it, of the blaverist reaction against it as well.
The book was also criticized by some Valencian nationalists as well, who considered that Fuster took the Catalan nationalist model without adjusting it to the reality of what soon after (1982) became the present Valencian Community with the passing of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy.
The book remained most influential in the Valencian Community during the 1980s. It began losing relevance by the early 1990s,[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] as the Unitat del Poble Valencià, a party which had been partially inspired by it, started shifting their doctrine from Catalanism to Valencianism-proper, still within the Catalanist tenet, though.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] To date, Nosaltres els Valencians remains a fundamental cornerstone of the literature on Valencian identity, as much despised by some —who see in it a Catalanist fifth column in Valencia— as revered by others —who regard it as a yet to be surpassed reflection on the Valencian identity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

[[Soros Foundation]]

CATEGORIES: Foundations, Charitable organizations, Non-profit organizations based in Europe, George Soros

A Soros Foundation is one of a network of national foundations created by the international financier and philanthropist, George Soros, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe. They fund volunteer socio-political activity and have been coordinated since early 1994 by a management team called the Open Society Institute. He claims the principles underlying the philosophy of the Open Society is that there can be no absolute answers to political questions because the same principle of reflexivity applies as in financial markets.Soros on Soros John Wiley, ISBN 978-0-471-11977-7
Soros foundations are autonomous institutions established in particular countries or regions, especially those emerging from behind the Iron Curtain,Hoduski-Abbott, Bernadine E., Lobbying for Libraries and the Public's Access to Government Information, Lanham: Scarecrow, 2003. p. 75 to initiate and support open society activities. Such countries include the former Communist bloc in Central and Eastern Europe, parts of the former Soviet Union, South Africa, and Haiti. 
The priorities and specific activities of each Soros foundation are determined by a local board of directors and staff in consultation with George Soros and OSI boards and advisers. In addition to support from the Open Society Institute, many of the foundations receive funding from other sources. Intended programs include "the education of librarians and others; expansion of a free press, Internet, and e-mail communication; publishing; human rights; arts and culture; and social, legal, and economic reform". 
One such program, for example, is the Library of Congress - Soros Foundation Visiting Fellows Program for librarians. Soros insists that staff in local Soros Foundation offices conduct the initial interviews of applicants and then allow LC to make the final decisions. He very much seeks to "influence the future of the newly democratized Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union...through educating  librarians about how to improve their libraries and assist the policymakers of their countries..order to provide a strong foundation for democracy".Hoduski-Abbott, Bernadine E., Lobbying for Libraries and the Public's Access to Government Information, Lanham: Scarecrow, 2003. p. 76 Soros pledged $206 million USD to endow the Central European University.Soros Pledges $206 Million to Hungarian University", Chronicle of Philanthropy, July 2005, Vol. 17 Issue 19, p. 20 In 1997, he received the James Madison Award from the Coalition on Government Information. Barbara Ford, president of the American Library Association, compared Soros to Andrew Carnegie in honor of his philanthropy, implying that its influence on the world's libraries rivals that of the Carnegie family on the United States'.
However, his critics point out that "In 2010, tax records show that Soros, a convicted inside trader ... deployed grantees from his Open Society Foundations to lobby for and acquire federal contracts for job training, green energy, and community redevelopment programs." By employing such coordinated activities, critics aver, Soros "advanced his agenda for "green economics", open borders, and increased government handouts."Criticism of Soros' activities at sorosfiles.com (April 2012 entry)

The network of Open Society Foundations (OSF), formerly the Open Society Institute (OSI) until 2011, is a grantmaking operation founded by George Soros, aimed to shape public policy to promote democratic governance, human rights, and economic, legal, and social reform. On a local level, OSF implements a range of initiatives to support the rule of law, education, public health, and independent media. At the same time, OSF works to build alliances across borders and continents on issues such as combating corruption and rights abuses.

[[Treatise (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Cornelius Cardew, 1960s works

Treatise is a musical composition by British composer Cornelius Cardew (1936-1981). Treatise is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that eschew conventional musical notation. Implicit in the title is a reference to the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, which was of particular inspiration to Cardew in composing the work. The score neither contains nor is accompanied by any explicit instruction to the performers in how to perform the work. Cardew worked on the composition from 1963 to 1967.
Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, almost infinite possibilities for the interpretation of Treatise that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map-reading (Anderson 2006).
Subsequently Cardew embraced Maoism and wholeheartedly repudiated this and other works of his avant-garde period. A savage indictment of Treatise may be seen in a speech delivered by Cardew at the ‘International Symposium on the Problematic of Today’s Musical Notation’ held in Rome in October 1972, as transcribed in his highly polemical book Stockhausen Serves Imperialism (1974), available in PDF format at UBUweb.

The Swedish public broadcasting system is largely modeled after the system used in the United Kingdom, and Sveriges Television shares many traits with its British counterpart, the BBC.
SVT is a public limited company that can be described as a quasi-autonomous non-government organisation. Together with the other two public broadcasters, Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Utbildningsradio, it is owned by an independent foundation, Förvaltningsstiftelsen för Sveriges Radio AB, Sveriges Television AB och Sveriges Utbildningsradio AB,  The foundation's board consist of 13 politicians, representing the political parties in the Riksdag and appointed by the Government. The foundation in turn appoints the members of the SVT board. SVTs regulatory framework is governed by Swedish law. Originally, SVT and Sveriges Radio were a joint company, but since 1979 they and Sveriges Utbildningsradio are sister companies sharing some joint services.  
SVT maintained a monopoly in domestic terrestrial broadcasting from the start in 1956 until the privately held TV4 started broadcasting terrestrially in 1992. It is barred from accepting advertisements except in the case of sponsors for major sporting events. Until the launch of the Swedish language satellite television channel TV3 in 1987, Sveriges Television provided the only Swedish television available to the public. SVT is still the biggest TV network in Sweden, with an audience share of 36.4%.

[[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]

CATEGORIES: Eurozone fiscal matters

The European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was a system introduced by the European Community in March 1979, as part of the European Monetary System (EMS), to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability in Europe, in preparation for Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of a single currency, the euro, which took place on 1 January 1999.
After the adoption of the euro, policy changed to linking currencies of countries outside the eurozone to the euro (having the common currency as a central point). The goal was to improve stability of those currencies, as well as to gain an evaluation mechanism for potential eurozone members. This mechanism is known as ERM II and has superseded ERM. Currently there are just two countries in the ERM II, the Danish krone and the Lithuanian litas.

The QWERTZ or QWERTZU keyboard is a widely used computer and typewriter keyboard layout that is mostly used in Central Europe. The name comes from the first six letters at the top left of the keyboard: Q, W, E, R, T, and Z.
The main difference between QWERTZ and QWERTY is that the positions of the "Z" and "Y" keys are switched, this change being made for two major reasons:
Like in many other non-English keyboards:
Some of special key inscriptions are often changed from an abbreviation to a graphical symbol (for example "Caps Lock" becomes a hollow arrow pointing down, "Backspace" becomes a left-pointing arrow). In German and Austrian keyboards, most of the other abbreviations are replaced by German abbreviations (thus e.g. "Ctrl" for "control" is translated to its German equivalent "Strg" for "Steuerung"). "Esc" for "escape" is not translated however. 
A QWERTZ keyboard layout is sometimes informally nicknamed a kezboard, substituting the y with a z.

AZERTY is a specific layout for the characters of the Latin alphabet on typewriter keys and computer keyboards. The layout takes its name from the first six letters to appear on the first row of alphabetical keys. Like the German QWERTZ layout, it is modeled on the English QWERTY layout. It is used by most French speakers based in Europe, though France and Belgium each have their own national variations on the layout.

CATEGORIES: Glaucidium, Birds of Ukraine

The Eurasian Pygmy Owl, Glaucidium passerinum, is the smallest
owl in Europe. These owls are a dark reddish to greyish-brown, with spotted sides and half of a white ring around the back of their neck.
The owl preys on birds – some nearly as large as itself – and small mammals, such as voles.
It is found in the boreal forests of Northern and Central Europe to Siberia, usually at the edges of clearings. It nests in old woodpecker holes, often those of the Great Spotted Woodpecker.
This is a sedentary species, meaning that adults are resident throughout the year in its range. The exception would be during harsh winters, when the adults may move south. Young of the species usually move in autumn or winter. In the wild Eurasian Pygmy Owls may live six to seven years and sometimes even longer in captivity.
This  Starling-sized bird hunts at dawn, dusk, and even daytime, rather than in total darkness.

[[Breakfast sausage]]
CATEGORIES: Cuisine of the Southern United States, American sausages, Smoked meat

Breakfast sausage (or country sausage) is a type of fresh pork sausage usually served at breakfast in the United States (and, under different names and/or formulations, in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mrbreakfast.com/w_ireland.asp|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=Breakfast In Ireland – MrBreakfast.com[/tpl] It is a common breakfast item in traditional American "farmer" or "country" breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Often, scraps and trimmings that would ordinarily have been fed to a dog or discarded were instead ground, seasoned, refrigerated and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
It is perhaps most popular for home consumption in rural regions, especially in the southern states, where it is in the form of fresh or smoked patties or links (the latter with natural casings, synthetic casings, or no casing at all). Most diners, fast-food restaurants, and family restaurants across the country will also offer one or more versions of it during breakfast hours, whether on a sandwich, in a breakfast platter, or both; some fine-dining establishments will also have a sausage option on their breakfast or brunch menu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/breakfast.html|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=Breakfast :: McDonalds.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dbbistro.com/nyc/breakfast/|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=BREAKFAST - DB Bistro - New York City[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/pdfs/OscarBreakfastJune2013.pdf|archivedate=2013-09-14|title=www.waldorfnewyork.com/pdfs/OscarBreakfastJune2013.pdf[/tpl] The cased link variety is most similar to English-style sausages and has been made in the United States since colonial days.  It is essentially highly seasoned ground meat, so it does not keep and should be stored and handled appropriately. Newer variations made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found. There are also vegetarian varieties that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. In America, the predominant spices used for seasoning are pepper and sage, although there are varieties also seasoned with cayenne pepper, or even maple syrup. Some breakfast sausage is flavored with cured bacon or ham.
Most commonly served as patties or slices from a large roll, breakfast sausage also comes in links of various lengths and diameters. It is normally fried in a pan. Some people like to pour ketchup or other condiments like maple syrup onto their breakfast sausages.  Cooked breakfast sausage is also commonly mixed into egg casseroles before baking, and is a central component of sausage gravy.

'''Thomas Joseph Sestak''' (March 9, 1936 – April 3, 1987) was an American collegiate [[Professional Football]] [[defensive lineman]] for the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[American Football League]].
In 1962, following an innovative AFL trend of drafting players from small colleges, the Bills drafted Sestak as a tight end in the 17th round from McNeese State University.  Sestak would never play that position for the Bills, but instead became one of the league's greatest defensive tackles. At 6-4, he had the size, speed and strength to handle any offensive lineman. 
Sestak was a starter in his rookie year and, until a series of knee injuries ended his career after the 1967 season,used his strength to dominate the line of scrimmage.  Sestak was a three-time selection to All-American Football League teams and a unanimous All-AFL defensive tackle in three consecutive years; 1963, 1964 and 1965. Sestak served as the cornerstone of a defense that took the Bills to the playoffs four straight years (1963–1966) and consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Over the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Sestak and his defense mates held opposing rushers without a touchdown for seventeen consecutive games, a Professional Football record that still stands.  Twice during his outstanding career he realized the defensive lineman's "dream", returning interceptions for touchdowns, and once returned a recovered fumble for a score.  
His teammates described his play as "crazy as hell".
During the sixties, only six professional defensive linemen were unanimous All-League selections for three or more years, Sestak (3), Bob Lily (5), Merlin Olsen (4), Willy Davis (3), Gino Marchetti (3), and Deacon Jones (3).  The latter five, all former NFL players, have already been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Sestak, a star from the AFL,  like many other AFL players has been ignored by the Hall of Fame selectors.  
In January 1970, Sestak was selected as a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team, and in 2009 as a member of the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team. In 2007, Tom Sestak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. {http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/football/tom-sestak/}

Nightwing is a superhero identity assumed by numerous fictional characters in the DC Comics universe. Prior to DC's continuity-altering 1985 limited series, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Nightwing identity was depicted as an invention of Superman's during a time when he and Jimmy Olsen act as vigilantes in the Kryptonian city of Kandor; Superman draws inspiration from his encounters with Batman and Robin. Post-Crisis, the name is attributed to a historic Kryptonian crimefighter; this hero serves as an inspiration for Dick Grayson when he sheds his Robin identity and assumes the name and a new costume. Grayson was featured in an ongoing Nightwing series between 1996 and 2009, before Grayson took on the identity of Batman. After Grayson's return to the Nightwing identity during DC's 2011 event The New 52, a new Nightwing series was also established. In 2013 Nightwing moves from Gotham, where he had been since the start of the New 52, to Chicago.

The national flag of the Republic of Macedonia ([tpl]lang-mk|Знаме на Република Македонија[/tpl]) depicts a stylised yellow sun on a red field, with eight broadening rays extending from the centre to the edge of the field. It was created by Pr. Miroslav Grčev and was adopted on 5 October 1995 after a one-year economic blockade imposed by Greece in order to force the Republic of Macedonia to remove the ancient Macedonian Vergina Sun from the flag. Red and yellow have always been considered the main colours representing Macedonia, probably because of the colours of the historical coat of arms of Macedonia. The new eight-rayed sun represents "the new sun of Liberty" referred to in the national anthem of the Republic of Macedonia, Denes nad Makedonija ("Today over Macedonia"):
The change of the flag was at first not accepted by conservative Macedonians and self-proclaimed patriots. In the first years after the change, both flags were officially flown for a long time. Between 1995 and 1998, in the municipalities where then-opposition party VMRO-DPMNE ruled, only the old flag was flown from institution buildings. Popular opinion was divided about the merits of changing the flag; a survey carried out before the Assembly's vote found that a bare majority of the population, 56.33 percent, supported the adoption of a new flag. Nonetheless the Assembly voted for the new flag by an overwhelming majority, with 110 of the 115 delegates voting in favour, one voting against and four abstaining.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

[[Wait state]]

CATEGORIES: Central processing unit

A wait state is a delay experienced by a computer processor when accessing external memory or another device that is slow to respond.
As of late 2011, computer microprocessors run at very high speeds, while memory technology does not seem to be able to catch up: typical PC processors like the Intel Core 2 and the AMD Athlon 64 X2 run with a clock of several GHz, which means that one clock cycle is less than 1 nanosecond (typically about 0.3 ns to 0.5 ns on modern desktop CPUs), while main memory has a latency of about 15–30 ns. Some second-level CPU caches run slower than the processor core.
When the processor needs to access external memory, it starts placing the address of the requested information on the address bus. It then must wait for the answer, that may come back tens if not hundreds of cycles later. Each of the cycles spent waiting is called a wait state.
Wait states are a pure waste for a processor's performance. Modern designs try to eliminate or hide them using a variety of techniques: CPU caches, instruction pipelines, instruction prefetch, branch prediction, simultaneous multithreading and others. No single technique is 100% successful, but together they can significantly reduce the problem.

[[Nuclear Overhauser effect]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical physics, Spectroscopy, Nuclear magnetic resonance

The Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nuclear spin population to another via cross-relaxation.  It is a common phenomenon observed by  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The theoretical basis for the NOE was described and experimentally verified by Anderson and Freeman in 1962.  The NOE is an extension of the seminal work of American physicist Albert Overhauser who in 1953 proposed that nuclear spin polarization could be enhanced by the microwave irradiation of the conduction electrons in certain metals.  The general Overhauser effect was first demonstrated experimentally by T. R. Carver  and C. P. Slichter, also in 1953.  Another early explanation and experimental observation of the NOE was by Kaiser in 1963  in an NMR experiment where the  spin polarization was transferred from one population of nuclear spins to another, rather than from electron spins to nuclear spins. However, the theoretical basis and the applicable Solomon equationsThe Solomon Equations and NOE. chem.iitm.ac.in had already been published by Ionel Solomon in 1955.[tpl]cite journal|author=Solomon, I|title= Relaxation Processes in a System of Two Spins|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=99|page=559 |year=1955|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.99.559|url=http://www.mmrrcc.upenn.edu/mediawiki/images/d/df/A08.pdf|bibcode = 1955PhRv...99..559S [/tpl]
Subsequent to its discovery, the NOE was shown to be highly useful in NMR spectroscopy for characterizing and refining organic chemical structures. In this application, the NOE differs from the application of spin-spin coupling in that the NOE occurs through space, not through chemical bonds. Thus, atoms that are in close proximity to each other can give a NOE, whereas spin coupling is observed only when the atoms are connected by 2–3 chemical bonds. The inter-atomic distances derived from the observed NOE can often help to confirm a precise molecular conformation, i.e. the three-dimensional structure of a molecule.  In 2002, Kurt Wüthrich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that the NOE could be exploited using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy to determine the three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules in solution.[ref]

Some examples of two-dimensional NMR experimental techniques exploiting the NOE include:

Chorizo (Spanish) or chouriço (Portuguese) is a term originating from the Iberian Peninsula encompassing several types of pork sausages.
Chorizo can be a fresh sausage, in which case it must be cooked before eating. In Europe, it is more frequently a fermented, cured, smoked sausage, in which case it is often sliced and eaten without cooking, and can be added as an ingredient to add flavour to other dishes. Spanish chorizo and Portuguese chouriço get their distinctive smokiness and deep red color from dried smoked red peppers (pimentón/pimentão). Due to culinary tradition and the cost of imported Spanish smoked paprika, Mexican chorizo is usually made with chili peppers, used abundantly in Mexican cuisine. In Latin America, vinegar also tends to be used instead of the white wine usually used in Spain. Traditionally, chorizo is encased in natural casings made from intestines, a method used since Roman times.
Some types of chorizo can be eaten without further cooking  (e.g. sliced or in a sandwich). Chorizos can be grilled, fried, or simmered in liquid, including apple cider, other strong alcoholic beverage such as aguardiente.

A major characteristic is jaundice, caused by elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream (hyperbilirubinemia).
The cause of this hyperbilirubinemia is the reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, which conjugates bilirubin and a few other lipophilic molecules.  Conjugation renders the bilirubin water-soluble, after which it is excreted in bile into the duodenum.

[[Turret]]
CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Fortification (architectural elements), Medieval defences

In architecture, a turret (from Italian: torretta, little tower; Latin: turris, tower) is a small tower that projects vertically from the wall of a building such as a medieval castle. Turrets were used to provide a projecting defensive position allowing covering fire to the adjacent wall in the days of military fortification. As their military use faded, turrets were used for decorative purposes, as in the Scottish baronial style.
A turret can have a circular top with crenellations as seen in the picture at right, a pointed roof, or other kind of apex. It might contain a staircase if it projects higher than the building; however, a turret is not necessarily higher than the rest of the building; in this case, it is typically part of a room, that can be simply walked into – see the turret of Chateau de Chaumont on the collection of turrets,Ontarioarchitecture.com which also illustrates a turret on a modern skyscraper.
A building may have both towers and turrets; turrets might be smaller or higher but the difference is generally considered to be that a turret projects from the edge of the building, rather than continuing to the ground. The size of a turret is therefore limited by technology, since it puts additional stresses on the structure of the building. It would traditionally be supported by a corbel.

Mary Shakespeare,  Mary Arden (maiden name), (c. 1537–1608) was the mother of William Shakespeare. She was the daughter of Robert Arden. The Arden family had been prominent in Warwickshire since before the Norman Conquest. She was the youngest of eight daughters, and she inherited her father's farm, now called Mary Arden's House, in Wilmcote, Warwickshire when he died in December 1556. 
Richard Shakespeare, the father of John Shakespeare, Mary's husband, was a tenant farmer on land owned by her father in Snitterfield. As the daughter of Richard's landlord; she may have known John since childhood.Wood, Michael. Shakespeare. New York: Basic, 2003. Print. Mary married John Shakespeare in 1557, when she was 20 years old.Wood, Michael. Shakespeare. New York: Basic, 2003. Print. She birthed eight children: Joan (1558), Margaret (1562–63), William (1564–1616), Gilbert (1566–1612), Joan (1569–1646), Anne (1571–79), Richard (1574–1613), and Edmund (1580–1607).A Shakespeare Genealogy Though they had many children, the couple did not have good luck. Their first daughter, Joan, born 1558 died, the name was used again for their third daughter. Their second daughter, Margaret, also died in infancy.Wood, Michael. Shakespeare. New York: Basic, 2003. Print. Some members of the wider Arden family were of the Catholic faith.Wood, Michael. Shakespeare. New York: Basic, 2003. Print.
Mary was from a family of status and her ancestors had connections in society, such as Thomas Arden, who fought in the thirteenth century civil war for the Barons and Simon de Montfort; Robert Arden who fought in the War of Roses; John Arden who served on the court of King Henry VII. Upon her Father's death, Mary inherited land in Snitterfield and Wilmcote.Wood, Michael. Shakespeare. New York: Basic, 2003. Print.
Mary Arden's House in Wilmcote has been maintained in good condition because it had been a working farmhouse over the centuries. It was bought by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1930 and refurnished in the Tudor style.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.onlineshakespeare.com/arden.htm|title = Mary Arden's House (the mother of William Shakespeare)|publisher = Online Shakespeare[/tpl]
In 2000 it was discovered that the building preserved as Mary Arden's house had belonged to a friend and neighbour Adam Palmer and the house was renamed Palmer's Farm. The house that had belonged to the Arden family which was near to Palmer's Farm had been acquired by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1968 for preservation as part of a farmyard without knowing its true provenance.The Shakespeare Houses - The Official Guide, Revised 2008, ISBN 978-0-7117-2949-0  The house and farm are open as historic museum displaying 16th century life.

Arthur Judson Brown (December 3, 1856 – January 11, 1963) was an influential American clergyman, missionary and prolific author.
Brown was born in Holliston, Massachusetts, and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1883. He preached in various cities throughout the United States, including Portland, Oregon and Oak Park, Illinois from 1883 to 1895. 
Often termed a "missionary statesman," Brown traveled throughout the world—most notably in China and other Asian countries. During the time he surveyed China, he wrote a seventeen-volume diary of what he'd seen and discovered.  Over time, Brown communicated with Roman Catholic, Jewish, and Greek Orthodox leaders, in addition to such influential Protestant clergymen as Henry Sloane Coffin, Nathan Söderblom, and John R. Mott. Brown himself received letters from five American Presidents and various other government officials. Booker T. Washington, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1839–1937), and John Wanamaker were among his famous American correspondents. In addition, members of European and Asian royalty, including Chinese general and emperor, Yuan Shih-kai, were in communication with Brown. 
Overall, Brown will be remembered as a pioneer in the ecumenical and world missionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries and was an individual who was active in and out of the church. He served in a plethora of notable positions. The following is a lengthy chronology of Brown's achievements and activities. During this time Brown also preached at various churches.
Arthur Judson Brown died in New York City in 1963, 39 days after celebrating his 106th birthday. He was subsequently buried in Orange, New Jersey.

[[Reversal film]]
CATEGORIES: Photographic film types

In photography, a reversal film is a type of photographic film that produces a positive image on a transparent base. The film is processed to produce transparencies or diapositives (abbreviated as diafilm in many countries) instead of negatives and prints. Reversal film is produced in various sizes, from 35 mm roll film to 8×10 inch sheet film.
A slide is a specially mounted individual transparency intended for projection onto a screen using a slide projector. This allows the photograph to be viewed by a large audience at once. The most common form is the 35 mm slide, with the image framed in a 2×2 inch cardboard or plastic mount. Some specialized labs produce photographic slides from digital camera images in formats such as JPEG, from computer-generated presentation graphics, and from a wide variety of physical source material such as fingerprints, microscopic sections, paper documents, astronomical images, etc.
Reversal film is sometimes used as motion picture film, mostly in the 16 mm, Super 8 and 8 mm "cine" formats, to yield a positive image on the camera original. This avoids the expense of using negative film, which requires additional film and processing to create a positive film print for projection.

The mission church that stands today was completed in 1791 and attached next door is Mission Dolores Basilica.

The See of San Francisco is administered by the Archbishop of San Francisco, who as metropolitan oversees the entire ecclesiastical province of San Francisco. Its suffragans include the Dioceses of Honolulu, Las Vegas, Oakland, Reno, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Stockton.
San Francisco once included among its suffragans the former dioceses of Grass Valley, Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego, Monterey, Monterey-Fresno, and Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles.
The Chancellery Office of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, originally located in 1853 at California and Dupont Streets, moved in 1891 to 1100 Franklin Street, in 1955 re-located to 445 Church Street, on the Mission Dolores Basilica property.

The M3 Stuart, formally Light Tank M3, was an American light tank of World War II. It was supplied to British and Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war. Thereafter, it was used by U.S. and Allied forces until the end of the war.
The name General Stuart or Stuart given by the British comes from the American Civil War Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart and was used for both the M3 and the derivative M5 Light Tank. In British service, it also had the unofficial nickname of Honey after a tank driver remarked "She's a honey".Crisp, Robert. Brazen Chariots (W.W. Norton & Co., 2005), pp.17–18. To the United States Army, the tanks were officially known only as "Light Tank M3" and "Light Tank M5".

The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office requested that the American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank for use by the airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.
After a series of modifications were made to the initial prototype, production of the T9 began in April 1943. It was significantly delayed, however, when several faults were found with the tank's design. Marmon-Herrington only began to produce significant numbers of the T9 in late 1943 and early 1944, and by then the design was considered to be obsolete; only 830 were built by the time production ended in February 1945. As a result, the Ordnance Department gave the tank the specification number M22 but no combat units were equipped with it. However, the War Office believed that the tank would perform adequately despite its faults, so the tank was given the title of "Locust" and 260 were shipped to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. Seventeen Locusts were received by the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in late 1943, but mechanical problems led to the tanks being withdrawn in favour of the Tetrarchs previously used by the regiment.
In October 1944 however, the remaining Tetrarchs of the regiment were replaced by Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945. The tanks did not perform well in action; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German self-propelled gun. Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action, occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company. The tanks were forced to withdraw from the position after several hours however, because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties. The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946. A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post-war period however; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments, and the Egyptian Army used several company-sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

The Medium Tank M3 was an American tank used during World War II. In Britain the tank was called by two names based on the turret configuration. Tanks employing US pattern turrets were called the "General Lee", named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Variants using British pattern turrets were known as "General Grant", named after U.S. General Ulysses S. Grant.
Design commenced in July 1940, and the first M3s were operational in late 1941.Zaloga p. 16 & 20 The U.S. Army needed a good tank and coupled with the United Kingdom's demand for 3,650 medium tanks immediately,Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 20 & 21 the Lee began production by late 1940. The M3 was well armed and armoured for the period, but due to design flaws (high silhouette, archaic sponson mounting of the main gun, below-average off-road performance) it was not satisfactory and was withdrawn from front line duty as soon as the M4 Sherman became available in large numbers.

[[Omnibenevolence]]

CATEGORIES: Attributes of God in Christian theology, Superlatives in religion, Theodicy, Theology

Omnibenevolence (from Latin omni- meaning "all", and benevolent, meaning "good")http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omnibenevolent is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "unlimited or infinite benevolence". It is often held to be impossible, or at least improbable, for a deity to exhibit such property alongside omniscience and omnipotence as a result of the problem of evil. However, some philosophers, such as Alvin Plantinga, argue the plausibility of co-existence. The word is primarily used as a technical term within academic literature on the philosophy of religion, mainly in context of the problem of evil and theodical responses to such. Although even in said contexts the phrases "perfect goodness" or "moral perfection" are often preferred because of the difficulties in defining what exactly constitutes 'infinite benevolence'.

The Ludus de Antichristo is a liturgical drama from the 12th century whose original author is unknown.  Its origins are almost certainly from southern Germany.  The manuscript that contains the play was kept at the monastery in Tegernsee, Bavaria.  Most likely the play was written c. 1160 as much of the thematic material corresponds closely to events occurring during the reign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa I and his troubles with Pope Alexander III.https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/30891/Thomas_Kyle.pdf?sequence=1  The drama warned its audience of the dangers posed by the Antichrist, a prophesied figure of evil whose coming (according to the Old and New Testaments) was an indication that the end of the world, or apocalypse, was near.

The Archdiocese of Los Angeles ([tpl]lang-la|Archidioecesis Angelorum in California[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Arquidiócesis de Los Ángeles[/tpl])  is an archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. state of California. Headquartered in Los Angeles, the archdiocese comprises the California counties of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura. The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and its present archbishop is José Horacio Gómez. With approximately five million professing members, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles is numerically the single largest diocese in the United States.
The Archbishop of Los Angeles also serves as metropolitan bishop of the suffragan dioceses within the Ecclesiastical Province of Los Angeles, which includes the Dioceses of Fresno, Monterey, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego. 
Following the establishment of the Spanish missions in California, the Holy See established the Diocese of the Two Californias in 1840, when the Los Angeles region was still part of Mexico. In 1848, present-day California was ceded to the United States, and the U.S. portion of the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey. The diocese was renamed the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles in 1859, and the episcopal see was moved to Los Angeles upon the completion of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in 1876. Los Angeles split from Monterey to become the Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego in 1922. The diocese was split again in 1936 to create the Diocese of San Diego, and the Los Angeles see was elevated to an archdiocese. The archdiocese's present territory was established in 1976, when Orange County was split off to establish the Diocese of Orange.

It serves as a waterway, connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan. It connects to Osaka Bay and provides a sea transport link to industrial centers in the Kansai region, including Osaka and Kobe. Before the construction of the Sanyō Main Line, it was the main transportation link between Kansai and Kyūshū.
Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hyōgo, Osaka, Kagawa, Ehime, Fukuoka, and Ōita prefectures all have coastlines on the Inland Sea; the cities of Hiroshima, Iwakuni, Takamatsu, and Matsuyama are also located on it.
The Inland Sea region is known for its moderate climate, with a stable year-round temperature and relatively low rainfall levels. The sea is also famous for its periodic [tpl]nihongo|red tides|赤潮|akashio[/tpl] caused by dense groupings of certain phytoplankton that result in the death of large numbers of fish.

[[Software bloat]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-patterns, Software engineering

Software bloat is a process whereby successive versions of a computer program become perceptibly slower, use more memory/diskspace or processing power, or have higher hardware requirements than the previous version whilst making only dubious user-perceptible improvements. The term is not applied consistently; it is often used as a pejorative by end users to describe undesired user interface changes even if those changes had little or no effect on the hardware requirements. In long-lived software, perceived bloat can occur from the software servicing a large, diverse marketplace with many differing requirements. Most end users will feel they only need some limited subset of the available functions and will regard the others as unnecessary bloat, even if people with different requirements do use them. 
Actual (measurable) bloat can occur due to de-emphasising software efficiency in favour of other concerns like developer productivity, or possibly through the introduction of new layers of abstraction like a virtual machine or other scripting engine for the purposes of convenience when developer constraints are reduced. The perception of improved developer productivity, in the case of practising development within virtual machine environments, comes from the developers no longer taking resource constraints and usage into consideration during design and development; this allows the product to be completed faster but it results in increases to the end user's hardware requirements to compensate.

The Disney Afternoon was a created-for-syndication two-hour television programming block which aired from September 10, 1990, until August 29, 1997. At that time, Disney decided to retire the name and continued to run a 90-minute syndicated block until 1999. The Disney Afternoon was produced by The Walt Disney Company, with distribution through their syndication subsidiary, Buena Vista Television. Before and after its cancellation, the shows in the block were rerun both on The Disney Channel (during the mid-to-late 1990s) and on Toon Disney (all of them between the channel's launch in 1998 and 2004, with some remaining until as late as 2008). Starting on October 2, 1995, four of the shows (Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, DuckTales, and Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers) were rerun on The Disney Channel as a two-hour programming block called "Block Party" which aired on weekdays in the late-afternoon/early-evening."Block Party: Four Disney Animated Series." The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: p. 36. Several of the block's shows are available on DVD in the United States.
The Disney Afternoon's two-hour block was broken up into four half-hour segments, each of which contained a cartoon series. As each season ended, the first cartoon shown in the lineup would typically be dropped, and a new one added to the end. The Disney Afternoon itself featured unique animated segments consisting of its own opening and "wrappers" around the cartoon shows shown.
This block did not air in every market across the United States, but for those markets that did not air the block in full, individual shows featured on The Disney Afternoon could be packaged by themselves.

Siegfried Bing (26 February 1838 – 6 September 1905), who usually gave his name as S. Bing, and was thus often referenced erroneously as "Samuel Bing" (Samuel Otto Bing, 1850–1905, was his brother) was a German art dealer who lived in Paris as an adult, and who helped introduce Japanese art and artworks to the West and was a factor in the development of the Art Nouveau style during the late nineteenth century.

[[Peach Bowl]]

The Peach Bowl (officially the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, and simply as the Chick-fil-A Bowl from 2006 to 2013) is an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta, Georgia since December 1968. The first three Peach Bowls were played at Grant Field on the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta. Between 1971 and 1991, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium hosted the game. Since 1992, the Georgia Dome has played host. The proposed New Falcons Stadium is planned to begin hosting the game in 2017. Seven of the first ten meetings (all but the 1968, 1971, and 1974 games) pitted an Atlantic Coast Conference team against an at-large opponent. From 1993 until 2013, the game has matched a Southeastern Conference team against one from the ACC. In 2005, the bowl hosted its first-ever matchup of top 10 ranked teams.
The game was originally created as a fund-raiser by the Lions Clubs of Georgia in 1968, but after years of lackluster attendance and revenue, the game was taken over by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce.
Chick-fil-A, based in nearby College Park, became the title sponsor of the event with the January 1998 game. Starting with the 2006 season, Chick-fil-A assumed complete naming rights to the game in a five year, $22 million, sponsorship deal, ending almost forty years of the Peach Bowl name. A new logo was unveiled April 6, 2006.
The funds from the deal were used to increase payouts for the participating teams. In response, the ACC gave the committee the first pick of its teams after the BCS since 2006--usually the loser of the ACC Championship Game or one of the division runners-up. The bowl currently has the fifth overall selection from the SEC (including the BCS).  However, the BCS has taken two SEC schools in every season since 2006, leaving the Chick-Fil-A with the sixth pick from the conference--usually one of the division runners-up. As of 2013, the bowl was sold out for 17 straight years, the second-longest streak behind only the Rose Bowl.http://www.chick-fil-abowl.com/PressBox/BowlNews/BowlNewsViewer/tabid/122/ArticleId/106/Chick-fil-A-Bowl-Achieves-Earliest-Sellout-in-its-History.aspx In 2007, the Chick-fil-A Bowl became the best-attended non-BCS bowl for the previous decade.
Starting with the 2014 season, the bowl will feature College Football Playoff matchups, with the 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2025 games hosting a national semifinal, with matchups in all years selected by the playoff selection committee.[tpl]cite web|url = http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120407aad.html|title = Auburn-Clemson Match-up Gives Chick-fil-A Bowl 11th Straight Sellout|accessdate = 2007-12-11|date = 2007-12-04|publisher = Auburn University[/tpl] In conjunction with its inclusion in the playoff system, the game's name was changed from Chick-fil-A Bowl to Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on April 21, 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=Chick-fil-A Bowl will restore ‘Peach’ to its name|author=Tim Tucker|publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=April 20, 2014|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/college-football/chick-fil-a-bowl-will-restore-peach-to-its-name/nfcpT/[/tpl]

The French Fourth Republic was the republican government of France between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican constitution. It was in many ways a revival of the Third Republic, which was in place before World War II, and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.
The Fourth Republic saw an era of great economic growth in France and the rebuilding of the nation's social institutions and industry after World War II, and played an important part in the development of the process of European integration which changed the continent permanently. The greatest accomplishments of the Fourth Republic were in social reform and economic development. In 1946, the government established a comprehensive social security system that assured unemployment insurance, disability and old-age pensions, and health care to all citizens."France", Microsoft® Encarta® Encyclopedia 2001. © 1993-2000 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
Some attempts were also made to strengthen the executive branch of government to prevent the unstable situation that had existed before the war, but the instability remained and the Fourth Republic saw frequent changes in government – there were twenty-one administrations in its twelve year history. Moreover, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding decolonization of the numerous remaining French colonies. After a series of crises, most importantly the Algerian crisis of 1958, the Fourth Republic collapsed. Wartime leader Charles de Gaulle returned from retirement to preside over a transitional administration which was empowered to design a new French constitution. The Fourth Republic was dissolved by a public referendum on 5 October 1958 which established the modern-day Fifth Republic.

CATEGORIES: Fishing industry, Fishing techniques and methods, Fishing nets

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net through the water behind one or more boats. The net that is used for trawling is called a trawl.
The boats that are used for trawling are called trawlers or draggers. Trawlers vary in size; from small open boats with only 30 hp engines to large factory trawlers with over 10,000 hp. Trawling can be carried out by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling).
Trawling can be contrasted with trolling, where baited fishing lines instead of trawls are drawn through the water. Trolling is used both for recreational and commercial fishing whereas trawling is used mainly for commercial fishing. Trawling is also commonly used as a scientific sampling, or survey, method http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dmf/publications/tr_38.pdf.

Robert J. Collier, publisher of Collier's Weekly magazine, was an air sports pioneer and president of the Aero Club of America. He commissioned the 525 pound (240 kg) trophy in 1911, originally named the Aero Club of America Trophy. Collier also was the owner of a Wright Model B biplane which he purchased in 1911. After presenting it several times, Collier died in 1918 after the end of World War I.
It was renamed in his honor in 1922 when the Aero Club dissolved, and the award was taken over by the NAA. The name became official in 1944, and the award presented once a year by the NAA president, with the trophy on permanent display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum.  As such, the trophy was in the custody of its 1969 co-recipient, Michael Collins during his directorship of the museum.

Crossing Jordan is an American television crime/drama series that aired on NBC from September 24, 2001 to May 16, 2007. It stars Jill Hennessy as Jordan Cavanaugh, M.D., a crime-solving forensic pathologist employed in the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The show used an ensemble cast approach that featured a group of Jordan's co-workers and police detectives assigned to the various cases. Its roster of central characters was created by Tim Kring, who also developed its core format. The title refers to both the name of the main character, who is commonly shown as "crossing" others—especially authority figures—to learn what she wants to know, and the biblical metaphor of the ancient Hebrews crossing the Jordan River, commonly used in spiritual songs to represent death and passage to the afterlife.
During the first two seasons, the series used a gimmick whereby Jordan and her retired police detective father Maximilian "Max" Cavanaugh (Ken Howard) role-play the events leading up to that episode's murder, which were depicted by showing Jordan playing the part of the victim or suspect in a recreation of the scene, the idea being that such role-playing would help Jordan to figure out the circumstances of the crime, like a criminal profiler. This element of the series was mostly dropped when Howard left the series as a regular; however, there were instances of Jordan role-playing with other characters, such as Woody and Macy.
After six seasons and 117 episodes on May 16, 2007, the series was canceled by NBC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/2007-cancelled-shows-several-nbc-cancellations/ |title=2007 Cancelled Shows: Several NBC Cancellations |publisher=TVSeriesFinale.com |date=May 14, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]

[[Volvo P1900]]

The Volvo Sport (also known as P1900) is a Swedish fiberglass-bodied roadster of which sixty-eight units were built  between 1956 and 1957 by Volvo Cars.
Assar Gabrielsson, Volvo's president and founder, got the idea for the car when he saw a Chevrolet Corvette in the United States and wanted to make something similar. He asked Glasspar, an American boatbuilder in Santa Ana, California, to tool a fibreglass/reinforced polyester body, which was later produced in Sweden. 
Erik Quistgaard was appointed as development team leader.
The car was built on a tubular-steel chassis and used the Volvo PV444's 1,414 cubic centimetre engine producing [tpl]convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=February 2010|reason=unexplained car jargon[/tpl]. The engines (B14A and B16B [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]) were fitted with twin SU carburetors, driving through a three-speed manual gearbox. Many other parts were taken also from the Volvo PV444.
Demand was low, and the build quality was not up to Volvo standards.[tpl]Cite web|author=Hunt, David R.|date=undated|url=http://www.volvoadventures.com/1900.html|title=The Volvosport P1900|accessdate=February 24, 2010|publisher=volvoadventures.com[/tpl] Gunnar Engellau, who replaced Gabrielsson as president in 1956, took one for a drive on a holiday weekend and was dissatisfied enough that on returning to his office the following week cancelled the remaining production. "I thought it would fall apart!" is the legendary quote.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
The total "Volvo Sport" production was sixty-eight cars, plus four or five prototypes. Forty-four were built in 1956, mostly for the Swedish market, and most still survive.[tpl]Clarify|date=February 2010|reason=as of what date?[/tpl] The bulk of 1957's production went to the U.S. and elsewhere, and fewer of these are still in existence. 
Volvo's next sports car, the P1800, was much more successful with 47,492 units sold.
However the development of the P-1900 led to the tuning of the B-16 motor, which was later put into the PV 444 series, making this car powerful enough to enter the American market.

[[Restriction modification system]]

CATEGORIES: Bacteriophages, Molecular biology, Immune system

The restriction modification system (RM system) is used by bacteria, and perhaps other prokaryotic organisms to protect themselves from foreign DNA, such as the one borne by bacteriophages.  This phenomenon was first noticed in the 1950s.  Certain bacteria strains were found to inhibit (restrict) the growth of viruses grown in previous strains.  This effect was attributed to sequence-specific restriction enzymes.
Bacteria have restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, which cleave double stranded DNA at specific points into fragments, which are then degraded further by other endonucleases. This prevents infection by effectively destroying the foreign DNA introduced by an infectious agent (such as a bacteriophage). Approximately one quarter of known bacteria possess RM systems and of those about one half have more than one type of system.
Given that the sequences of the restriction enzymes recognize are very short, the bacterium itself will almost certainly have many of these sequences present in its own DNA. Therefore, in order to prevent destruction of its own DNA by the restriction enzymes, the bacterium marks its own DNA by adding methyl groups to it. This modification must not interfere with the DNA base-pairing, and therefore, usually only a few specific bases are modified on each strand.
Endonucleases cleave internal/non-terminal phosphodiester bonds. Restriction endonucleases cleave internal phosphodiester bonds only after recognising specific sequences in DNA which are usually 4-6 base pairs long, and often palindromic.

[[Lingayatism]]
CATEGORIES: Karnataka society, Lingayatism, Hindu denominations, Monotheistic religions, Social groups of Karnataka

Lingayatism is an independent religion, is a distinct Shaivite tradition in India, established in  12th century by  social reformer Basavanna. It makes several departures from mainstream Hinduism and propounds monotheism through worship centered on Lord Shiva in the form of linga or Ishtalinga. It also rejects the authority of the Vedas, the caste system, and some Hindu beliefs such as reincarnation and karma.[ref]
</ref><ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342355/Lingayat Lingayat]." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 09 Jul. 2010.</ref>
The adherents of this faith are known as Lingayats ([tpl]lang-kn|ಲಿಂಗಾಯತರು[/tpl], Telugu: లింగాయత, Tamil: இலிங்காயதம், Marathi: लिंगायत). The term is derived from Lingavantha in Kannada, meaning 'one who wears Ishtalinga (kan: ಇಷ್ಟಲಿಂಗ) on their body'. Ishtalinga is an oval-shaped emblem symbolising Parasiva, the absolute reality, and is worn on the body by a cord hung around the neck. A linga, on the other hand, is found inside a temple.
Contemporary Lingayatism is a rich blend of progressive reform-based theology propounded by Basava and ancient Shaivite tradition and customs, with huge influence among the masses in South India, especially in the state of Karnataka. Today, Lingayats, along with Shaiva Siddhanta followers, Kashmiri Shaivites, Naths, Pashupaths of Nepal, Kapalikas and others, constitute the major portion of the Shaivite population.For an overview of the Shaiva Traditions, see Flood, Gavin, "The Śaiva Traditions", in: Flood (2003), pp. 200-228. For an overview that concentrates on the Tantric forms of Śaivism, see Alexis Sanderson's magisterial survey article Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions, pp.660--704 in The World's Religions, edited by Stephen Sutherland, Leslie Houlden, Peter Clarke and Friedhelm Hardy, London: Routledge, 1988.Shaivam[tpl]Harvnb|Tattwananda|1984|p=54[/tpl].

[[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]]

CATEGORIES: Consciousness studies, Transhumanism, Conceptual models, Theories of mind

The eight-circuit model of consciousness is a  theory proposed by Timothy Leary and expanded on by Robert Anton Wilson and Antero Alli. The model describes eight circuits of information (eight "brains") that operate within the human nervous system. Each circuit is concerned with a different sphere of activity.
The lower four, the larval circuits, deal with normal psychology, while the upper four, the stellar circuits, deal with psychic, mystical, enlightened and psychedelic states of mind. These higher circuits are thought to have only recently evolved, with just a fraction of human beings using them. The higher the circuit, the fewer people have activated it. Leary describes the four larval circuits as necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society. Leary proposed that the higher four exist primarily for [tpl]em|future[/tpl] use by humans who might someday migrate to outer space and live extraterrestrially.
Leary, Alli and Wilson have written about the model in depth and how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies.
The term "circuits" came from the first wave of cybernetics research and development in the United States in the 1970s. (Others[tpl]weasel-inline|date=August 2011[/tpl] have proposed that the term "systems" should be substituted for "circuits" to reflect both a systems theory approach and also the changing anatomy of an entity as it goes through a neurological change).
Each successive circuit represents a more complex phase of evolution. In line with recapitulation theory, the model applies equally to the evolution of an individual organism and the evolution of the whole tree of life. Each neurological circuit provides a new cognitive function (whether or not the organism is aware of the circumstances that led to its activation).

[tpl]Baptist[/tpl]The Association of Regular Baptist Churches is one of the smaller Canadian Baptist bodies. Formed in 1957, the association is fundamentalist and separatist in its doctrine. ARBC supports the Toronto Baptist Seminary and Bible College, and publishes The Gospel Witness. Currently (2003) the ARBC has 10 churches (mostly in Ontario) with approximately 1500 members. In addition to these ten churches that are considered "recognized" members of the association, about 10 more are considered "supporting" churches. One of its leading churches is Jarvis Street Baptist Church of Toronto, Ontario, whose well-known pastor of 45 years, Thomas Todhunter Shields (1873–1955), led fundamentalist forces in the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec during the fundamentalist/modernist controversies in the first half of the 20th century. Forerunners of the ARBC include the Union of Regular Baptist Churches, which was formed in 1928 in Hamilton, Ontario by 77 churches withdrawing from Ontario/Quebec Convention over the election of a liberal professor at McMaster University. Another descendant of the Union of Regular Baptists is the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada.
According to the ARBC, they are "a group of free, self-governing churches holding steadfastly to the great doctrines of Grace always held by Baptists, and acknowledging the sole authority of the Word of God and the headship of Christ."

Boris I, also known as Boris-Mikhail (Michael) and Bogoris ([tpl]lang-bg|Борис I / Борис-Михаил[/tpl]; died 2 May 907), was the Knyaz (Prince) of the First Bulgarian Empire in 852–889. At the time of his baptism in 864, Boris was named Michael after his godfather, Emperor Michael III. The historian Steven Runciman called him one of the greatest persons in history.Runciman, p. 152
Despite a number of military setbacks, the reign of Boris I was marked with significant events that shaped Bulgarian and Slavic history. With the Christianization of Bulgaria the traditional state religion Tengriism was abolished. A skilful diplomat, Boris I successfully exploited the conflict between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy to secure an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, thus dealing with the nobility's concerns about Byzantine interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs.
When in 885 the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius were banished from Great Moravia, Boris I gave them refuge and provided assistance to develop the Slavic alphabet and literature. After he abdicated in 889, his eldest son and successor tried to restore the old pagan religion but was deposed by Boris I. During the Council of Preslav which followed that event, the Byzantine clergy was replaced with Bulgarians, and the Greek language was replaced with Old Church Slavonic as an official language of the Church and the state.
He is regarded as a saint in the Orthodox Church, as the Prince and baptizer of Bulgaria, and as Equal-to-the-Apostles, with his feast day observed on May 2.[tpl]gr icon[/tpl] Ὁ Ἅγιος Βόρις – Μιχαὴλ ὁ Ἱσαπόστολος ὁ πρίγκιπας καὶ Φωτιστῆς τοῦ Βουλγαρικοῦ λαοῦ. 2 Μαΐου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.

[[Olmec figurine]]
CATEGORIES: Olmec art, Mesoamerican artifacts, Figurines, Pre-Columbian pottery, Hardstone carving, Terracotta

This article on the Olmec figurine describes a number of archetypical figurines produced by the Formative Period inhabitants of Mesoamerica.  While many of these figurines may or may not have been produced directly by the people of the Olmec heartland, they bear the hallmarks and motifs of Olmec culture.  While the extent of Olmec control over the areas beyond their heartland is not yet known, Formative Period figurines with Olmec motifs were widespread in the centuries from 1000 to 500 BCE, showing a consistency of style and subject throughout nearly all of Mesoamerica.
These figurines are usually found in household refuse, in ancient construction fill, and (outside the Olmec heartland) in graves, although many Olmec-style figurines, particularly those labelled as Las Bocas- or Xochipala-style, were recovered by looters and are therefore without provenance.
The vast majority of figurines are simple in design, often nude or with a minimum of clothing, and made of local terracotta.  Most of these recoveries are mere fragments: a head, arm, torso, or a leg.Castro-Leal, p. 143 .  It is thought, based on wooden busts recovered from the water-logged El Manati site, that figurines were also carved from wood, but, if so, none have survived.
More durable and better known by the general public are those figurines carved, usually with a degree of skill, from jade, serpentine, greenstone, basalt, and other minerals and stones.

[[Reusable launch system]]

CATEGORIES: Spacecraft propulsion, Reusable space launch systems, Space launch vehicles, Space access, Reuse

A reusable launch system (or reusable launch vehicle, RLV) is a launch system which is capable of launching a launch vehicle into space more than once. This contrasts with expendable launch systems, where each launch vehicle is launched once and then discarded.
No true orbital reusable launch system is currently in use.  The closest example was the partially reusable Space Shuttle. The orbiter, which included the main engines, and the two solid rocket boosters, were reused after several months of refitting work for each launch.  The external fuel drop tank was discarded, but it would have been possible for it to be re-used in space for various applications.NASA-CR-195281, "Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system". NASA, August 23–27, 1982.STS External Tank Station. astronautix.com
Orbital RLVs are thought to provide the possibility of low cost and highly reliable access to space. However, reusability implies weight penalties such as non-ablative reentry shielding and possibly a stronger structure to survive multiple uses, and given the lack of experience with these vehicles, the actual costs and reliability are yet to be seen.

It is a fairly large wader though is mid-sized by the standards of its family. Length ranges from [tpl]convert|38|to|46|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], wingspan from [tpl]convert|76|to|88|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and weight from [tpl]convert|290|to|535|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl].http://www.birdsinbulgaria.org/birds.php?l=en&semeystvo=24&vid=174&type=bird (2011).CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B.

The bird is striking in flight, with black and white wing markings.
Despite being classed as a wader, this species prefers dry open habitats with some bare ground. It is largely nocturnal, particularly when singing its loud wailing songs, which are reminiscent of that of curlews. Food consists of insects and other small invertebrates, and occasionally small reptiles, frogs and rodents. It lays 2-3 eggs in a narrow scrape in the ground.
The stone curlew occurs throughout Europe, north Africa and southwestern Asia. It is a summer migrant in the more temperate European and Asian parts of its range, wintering in Africa.

[[Internal affairs (law enforcement)]]

CATEGORIES: Law enforcement

The internal affairs (United States terminology) division of a law enforcement agency investigates incidents and plausible suspicions of lawbreaking and professional misconduct attributed to officers on the force. In different systems, internal affairs can go by another name as "Internal Investigations Division" (usually referred to as 'IID'), "professional standards," "inspectorate general", Office of Professional Responsibility or similar. Non-internal affairs officers often derisively refer to the departments as the "rat squad".New York Times article "N.Y.P.D. Confidential"
Several police departments in the USA have been compelled to institute civilian review or investigation of police misconduct complaints in response to community perception that internal affairs investigations are biased in favor of police officers. For example, San Francisco, California, has its Office of Citizen Complaints, created by voter initiative in 1983, in which civilians who have never been members of the San Francisco Police Department investigate complaints of police misconduct filed against members of the San Francisco Police Department. Washington, DC, has a similar office, created in 1999, known as the Office of Police Complaints.D.C. Office of Police Complaints
Due to the sensitive nature of this responsibility, in many departments, officers working internal affairs are not in a detective command, but report directly to the agency's chief, or to a board of civilian police commissioners.
Internal Affairs investigators are bound by stringent rules when conducting their investigations.  In California, the Peace Officers Bill of Rights (POBR) is a mandated set of rules found in the Government Code.Text of "Peace Officers Bill of Rights" - Peace Officers Research Association of California (PORAC)

P. D. Q. Bach is a fictitious composer invented by musical satirist "Professor" Peter Schickele. In a gag that Schickele has developed over a five-decade-long career, he performs "discovered" works of the "only forgotten son" of the Bach family. Schickele's music combines parodies of musicological scholarship, the conventions of Baroque and classical music, and some slapstick comedy.
The name "P. D. Q." is a parody of the three-part names given to some members of the Bach family that are commonly reduced to initials, such as C. P. E., for Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. PDQ is an initialism for "pretty damn quick".

Horn & Hardart was a food services company in the United States noted for operating the first food service automats in Philadelphia and New York City.
Philadelphia's Joseph Horn (1861–1941) and German-born, New Orleans-raised Frank Hardart (1850–1918)[tpl]cite web|title=Frank Hardart, Sr.|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10481130|work=Find A Grave Memorial|accessdate=13 July 2012[/tpl]  opened their first restaurant together in Philadelphia on December 22, 1888. The small (11 x 17 foot) lunchroom at 39 South Thirteenth Street had no tables, only a counter with 15 stools. Formerly, the location had housed the print shop of Dunlap & Claypoole, printers to the American Congress and George Washington.
By introducing Philadelphia to New Orleans-style French-drip coffee, which Hardart promoted as their "gilt-edge" brew, they made their tiny luncheonette a local attraction. News of the coffee spread, and the business flourished. They incorporated as the Horn & Hardart Baking Company in 1898.Find a Grave: Frank Hardart Sr.

In Christian churches with episcopal polity, the rank of metropolitan bishop, or simply metropolitan, pertains to the diocesan bishop or archbishop (then more precisely called metropolitan archbishop) of a metropolis; that is, the chief city of a historical Roman province, ecclesiastical province, or regional capital.
Before the establishment of patriarchs (beginning in AD 325), metropolitan was the highest episcopal rank in the Eastern rites of the Church. They presided over synods of bishops, and were granted special privileges by canon law and sacred tradition.
The Early Church structure generally followed the Roman imperial practice, with one bishop ruling each city and its territory. The bishop of the provincial capital, the metropolitan, enjoyed certain rights over other bishops in the province, later called suffragans."metropolitan." Cross, F. L., ed.

Hebephilia is approximate in its age range because the age of onset of puberty varies.

According to research by Ray Blanchard et al. (2009), sex offenders could be separated into groups by victim age preference on the basis of penile plethysmograph response patterns. Based on their results, Blanchard suggested that the DSM-5 could account for these data by subdividing the existing diagnosis of pedophilia into hebephilia and a narrower definition of pedophilia. Psychologist Bruce Rind and sociologist Richard Yuill have published criticism of the classification of hebephilia as a mental disorder, though their view is that Blanchard et al. successfully established hebephilia as a "genuine sexual preference"; they suggested that if hebephilia were listed in the DSM-5, that it be coded as a condition that results in significant social problems today.Rind, Bruce; Yuill, Richard (2012).

[[Look and feel]]
CATEGORIES: Usability, User interfaces, Graphical user interfaces, Graphical user interface elements

In software design, look and feel is a term used in respect of a graphical user interface and comprises aspects of its design, including elements such as colors, shapes, layout, and typefaces (the "look"), as well as the behavior of dynamic elements such as buttons, boxes, and menus (the "feel"). The term can also refer to aspects of an API, mostly to parts of an API that are not related to its functional properties. The term is used in reference to both software and websites.
Look and feel applies to other products. In documentation, for example, it refers to the graphical layout (document size, color, font, etc.) and the writing style. In the context of equipment, it refers to consistency in controls and displays across a product line.
Look and feel in operating system user interfaces serves two general purposes. First, it provides branding, helping to identify a set of products from one company. Second, it increases ease of use, since users will become familiar with how one product functions (looks, reads, etc.) and can translate their experience to other products with the same look and feel.

[[DCF77]]

DCF77 is a German longwave time signal and standard-frequency radio station. It started service as a standard-frequency station on 1 January 1959. In June 1973 date and time information was added. Its primary and backup transmitter are located at [tpl]coord|50|0|56|N|9|00|39|E[/tpl] in Mainflingen, about 25 km south-east of Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
DCF77 is controlled by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany's national physics laboratory and transmits in continuous operation (24 hours). It is operated by Media Broadcast GmbH (previously a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG), on behalf of the PTB. With Media Broadcast GmbH, a temporal transmission availability of at least 99.7% per year has been agreed upon. In the year 2002 almost 99.95% availability or just over 4.38 hours of downtime was realized.[tpl]cite web |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news59790%20 |title=Das abwechslungsreichste Radioprogramm der Welt |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2003-02-21 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |language= German[/tpl] The timestamp sent is either in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)+1 or UTC+2 depending on daylight saving time.[tpl]cite web|title=Time and Standard Frequency Station DCF77 (Germany)|url=http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/dcf77.html[/tpl] 100503 eecis.udel.edu

[[Amphidromic point]]
CATEGORIES: Wave mechanics, Tides

An amphidromic point is a point of zero amplitude of one harmonic constituent of the tide.http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/ag/article/view/729/1081  The tidal range (the amplitude, or height difference between high tide and low tide) for that harmonic constituent increases with distance from this point.https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth540/content/c6_p1.html These points are sometimes called tidal nodes.
The term amphidromic point derives from the Greek words amphi (around) and dromos (running), referring to the rotary tides running around them.[tpl]Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-79746-7 | last = Cartwright | first = David Edgar | title = Tides: A Scientific History | year = 2000 | page = 243 [/tpl]
Amphidromic points occur because of the Coriolis effect and interference within oceanic basins, seas and bays creating a wave pattern — called an amphidromic system — which rotates around the amphidromic point.https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth540/content/c6_p1.htmlhttp://www.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides.html At the amphidromic points of the dominant tidal constituent, there is almost no vertical movement from tidal action. There can be tidal currents since the water levels on either side of the amphidromic point are not the same.  A separate amphidromic system is created by each periodic tidal component.http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/645fall2003_web.dir/ellie_boyce/amphidromic.htm
In most locations M2 is the largest (semidiurnal) tidal constituent, with an amplitude of roughly half of the full tidal range. Having cotidal points means they reach high tide at the same time and low tide at the same time. In the accompanying figure, the low tide lags or leads by 1 hr 2 min from its neighboring lines. Where the lines meet are amphidromes, and the tide rotates around them; for example, along the Chilean coast, and from southern Mexico to Peru, the tide propagates southward, while from Baja California to Alaska the tide propagates northward.

CATEGORIES: 1989 introductions, Linked lists, Probabilistic data structures

In computer science, a skip list is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, each skipping over fewer elements. Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically.[tpl]cite doi|10.1145/78973.78977[/tpl]Deterministic skip lists

"Jute" is the name of the plant or fiber that is used to make burlap, Hessian or gunny cloth.
Jute is one of the most affordable natural fibers and is second only to cotton in amount produced and variety of uses of vegetable fibers. Jute fibers are composed primarily of the plant materials cellulose and lignin. It falls into the bast fiber category (fiber collected from bast or skin of the plant) along with kenaf, industrial hemp, flax (linen), ramie, etc. The industrial term for jute fiber is raw jute. The fibers are off-white to brown, and 1–4 metres (3–13 feet) long. Jute is also called "the golden fiber" for its color and high cash value.

Magdalene asylums, also known as Magdalen institutions, were institutions from the 18th to the late-20th centuries ostensibly to house "fallen women", a term used to imply female sexual promiscuity or work in prostitution. Asylums operated throughout Europe and North America for much of the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century. London's Magdalen Asylum was active from 1758 to 1966,"Magdalen Hospital for the Reception of Penitent Prostitutes". Retrieved 18 February 2013. and the last laundry in Ireland closed in 1996.
The institutions were named after Mary Magdalene, in earlier centuries characterised as a converted prostitute from the Bible who was rewarded by Jesus with forgiveness and love.^ "Parrot, Cummings 7". These institutions (also called laundries and asylums) were complexes in Europe, Australia and North America that enslaved women, institutionalizing them against their will, and stripping them of their rights and identities.  Between the late 1700s to the late 1990s, women were "locked away performing menial domestic chores such as laundering prison and priest’s uniforms, cooking, scrubbing floors and windows and caring for the sick and aging nuns".
In Ireland, such asylums were known as Magdalen laundries where it is estimated that, since their inception, up to 30,000 women had been incarcerated.Ryan, Carol.

COLI was originally purchased on the lives of key employees and executives by a company to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner. This use is commonly known as "key man" or "key person" insurance.

[[History of copyright law]]

CATEGORIES: History of copyright law, Legal history by issue

The history of copyright law starts with early privileges and monopolies granted to printers of books. The British Statute of Anne 1710, full title "An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned", was the first copyright statute. Initially copyright law only applied to the copying of books. Over time other uses such as translations and derivative works were made subject to copyright and copyright now covers a wide range of works, including maps, performances, paintings, photographs, sound recordings, motion pictures and computer programs.
Today national copyright laws have been standardized to some extent through international and regional agreements such as the Berne Convention and the European copyright directives. Although there are consistencies among nations' copyright laws, each jurisdiction has separate and distinct laws and regulations about copyright. Some jurisdictions also recognize moral rights of creators, such as the right to be credited for the work.
Copyright are exclusive rights granted to the author or creator of an original work, including the right to copy, distribute and adapt the work. Copyright does not protect ideas, only their expression or fixation. In most jurisdictions copyright arises upon fixation and does not need to be registered. Copyright owners have the exclusive statutory right to exercise control over copying and other exploitation of the works for a specific period of time, after which the work is said to enter the public domain. Uses which are covered under limitations and exceptions to copyright, such as fair use, do not require permission from the copyright owner. All other uses require permission and copyright owners can license or permanently transfer or assign their exclusive rights to others.

[[Texas root rot]]

CATEGORIES: Pezizales, Plant pathogens and diseases, Cotton diseases

Texas root rot (also known as Phymatotrichopsis root rot, Phymatotrichum root rot, cotton root rot, or, in the older literature, Ozonium root rot) is a
pathogen fairly common in Mexico and the southwestern
United States that causes sudden wilt and death of
affected plants, usually during the warmer months.  It is a
soil-borne fungus of the species
Phymatotrichopsis omnivora that attacks the roots of
susceptible plants.  Because the damaged roots are unable to
take up enough water to maintain the plant in warm weather,
the leaves wilt and the plant dies.  The
dead leaves usually remain attached to the plant.
A multitude of dicotyledonous tree, shrub and herbaceous plants are susceptible to
Texas root rot, including figs, pomegranates, elms, grapes,
cotton, alfalfa, oleander, and roses. The largest compilation of hosts, more than 1,700, was made by J. Taubenhaus and W. Ezekiel.J.J. Taubenhaus and W.N. Ezekiel. 1936. A rating of plants with reference to their relative resistance or susceptibility to Phymatotrichum root rot. Texas Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 527 It is
one of the most destructive fungal plant diseases.  Some
monocot plants are tolerant and others are immune.
Eradication or control of Texas root rot is difficult, at best.
The fungus is known to thrive in moist and alkaline
soils.  It can survive for long periods in the soil,
sometimes lying dormant for decades, and can penetrate to
depths of up to twelve feet.  Increasing the organic
content of the soil with compost and green manure may
help to reduce growth of the fungus.
A monograph of this disease, which includes a historical review, was written by Streets and Bloss in 1973.R.B. Streets and H.E. Bloss. 1973. Phymatotrichum Root Rot. Monograph #8. The American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN

Ernest Lalor "Ern" Malley was a fictitious poet and the central figure in Australia's most celebrated literary hoax. He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax Max Harris and Angry Penguins, the modernist magazine Harris had founded and edited.James McAuley at the Australian Dictionary of Biography Online
In the decades after their publication, the hoax had a negative effect on the cause of modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as John Ashbery and Robert Hughes.

The Pericopes of Henry II (Munich, Bavarian State Library, Clm 4452) is a luxurious medieval illuminated manuscript made for Henry II, the last Ottonian Holy Roman Emperor, made  c. 1002 – 1012 AD. The manuscript, which is lavishly illuminated, is a product of the Liuthar circle of illuminators, who were working in the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenau, which housed a scriptorium and artists' workshop that has a claim to having been the largest and artistically most influential in Europe during the late 10th and early 11th centuries.  An unrivalled series of liturgical manuscripts was produced at Reichenau under the highest patronage of Ottonian society. (Other centers include  scriptoria at Lorsch, Trier and Regensburg.)
Unlike a Gospel Book, gospel pericopes contain only the passages from the gospels which are to be read during the liturgical year, making it easier for the priest celebrating Mass to find the gospel reading. It is 425 mm by 320 mm and has 206 vellum folios.

[[Drogo Sacramentary]]
CATEGORIES: 9th-century books, 9th-century Christian texts, Christian illuminated manuscripts, Carolingian art

The Drogo Sacramentary (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, MS lat. 9428) is a Carolingian illuminated manuscript on vellum of c.850 AD, one of the monuments of Carolingian book illumination.  A sacramentary is a book containing all the prayers spoken by the officiating priest during the course of the year.
The Sacramentary was written and painted for the personal use of Charlemagne's son Drogo, bishop of Metz. Metz was an important bishopric: Charles the Bald was crowned in the Basilica, and there Louis the Pious and his illegitimate half-brother Drogo the Bishop are buried. In 843 Metz became the capital of the kingdom of Lotharingia, and several diets and councils were held there.
Drogo's position enabled him to be one of the great patrons of 9th-century arts.  He embellished his cathedral in Metz with works which rank among the highlights of Carolingian art in beauty and preciousness. Among them are three surviving manuscripts from the court school, of which the Drogo Sacramentary is the most mature and most accomplished.
This Sacramentary is not the product of a monastic scriptorium but reveals an origin in a court school. It contains only those liturgical sections that the bishop spoke. An example of the individual character of its iconography is the initial O for Palm Sunday prayers, which contains a Crucifixion of a new iconographic type, one that would be called christus patiens rather than the triumphant Christ on the cross (christus triumphans) that had been the norm. In the image, the dead and tortured body of Christ spouts water and blood, which are collected by a female figure recognizable as Ecclesia, the Church, in a chalice, that would become entangled with the Holy Grail legend in the future. The Serpent entwines the base of the cross and figures representing the Sun and Moon witness the event from above. The manuscript's style, too, is considered to show the patron's influence, in an unusually unified work of a small group of artists working in close cooperation.
It is 264 mm by 214 mm and has 130 folios.  It is lavishly illuminated.

[[Approximation]]
CATEGORIES: Approximations, Numerical analysis

An approximation is anything that is similar but not exactly equal to something else. The term can be applied to various properties (e.g. value, quantity, image, description) that are nearly but not exactly correct; similar, but not exactly the same.
Although approximation is most often applied to numbers, it is also frequently applied to such things as mathematical functions, shapes, and physical laws.
In science, approximation can refer to using a simpler process or model when the correct model is difficult to use. An approximate model is used to make calculations easier. Approximations might also be used if incomplete information prevents use of exact representations. 
The type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree of accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the savings (usually in time and effort) that can be achieved by approximation.

Selden G. Hooper (25 December 1904 – 7 February 1976) was the only Admiral of the United States Navy to be convicted by court-martial.
Hooper was the commissioning commanding officer of the [tpl]Sclass|Fletcher|destroyer[/tpl] [tpl]USS|Uhlmann|DD-687[/tpl] on 22 November 1943.
In U.S. V. Hooper, 26 CMR 417 (CMA, 1958), Hooper was tried by general court-martial for sodomy, conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Hooper had retired as a Rear Admiral in 1950, and the acts for which he was tried were committed after he had retired. The defense questioned the military court's jurisdiction, but the court explained that "retired personnel are a part of the land or naval forces." The military retiree, then, is not simply a civilian. The court held that the admiral was "a part of the military forces of this country." He was described as "an officer of the Navy of the United States, entitled to wear the uniform and to draw pay as such." He was convicted and sentenced to dismissal and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.
Hooper was the only flag officer of the U.S. Navy to be convicted by court-martial, and strictly speaking, the only Navy flag officer to ever be tried by court-martial.  In 1995 Everett L. Greene was acquitted of sexual harassment and other related charges; he had been selected for promotion to Rear Admiral but was still a Captain when he was tried.

[[Wimple]]
CATEGORIES: History of clothing (Europe), Roman Catholic religious clothing, Headgear, Medieval costume, Belarusian clothing, Religious headwear, Ukrainian clothing

A wimple is a garment worn around the neck and chin, and which usually covers the head. Its use developed among women in early medieval Europe.  At many stages of medieval culture it was unseemly for a married woman to show her hair. A wimple might be elaborately starched, and creased and folded in prescribed ways, even supported on wire or wicker framing (cornette).
Italian women abandoned their headcloths in the 15th century, or replaced them with transparent gauze, and showed their elaborate braids. Both elaborate laundry and elaborate braiding demonstrated status, in that such grooming was being performed by others. Today the wimple is worn by some nuns who still don the traditional habit.

The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock temples in Abu Simbel ([tpl]lang|ar|أبو سمبل[/tpl] in Arabic) in Nubia, southern Egypt. They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km southwest of Aswan (about 300 km by road). The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments,"Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae - UNESCO World Heritage Centre which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan).
The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC, as a lasting monument to himself and his queen Nefertari, to commemorate his alleged victory at the Battle of Kadesh. However, the complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir.
The relocation of the temples was necessary to avoid their being submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River.

Voice Crack was a Swiss electronic free improvisation group. Formed in late 1972 by Andy Guhl and Norbert Möslang, Voice Crack were initially a free jazz duo. They began incorporating pre-recorded tape effects and live sound processing, and by 1983 they eliminated any normal instrumentation in favor of what they call "cracked everyday electronics:" Mundane objects such as "radios, turntables, transmitters, dictating machines" and other items are cracked open and manipulated to produce "new sounds using magnetic and radio waves in a complex system controlled by movements of their hands and by light."For4ears.com 
The resulting music - which consisted of various overlapping buzzes, clicks, drones and oscillations - has been described as, "Cascading magnetic waves arc across the sky as three-headed critters race and rummage through alien flora ... or at least that's what it sounds like.";Erstwhilerecords.com and was favorably compared to some of John Cage's work.Allmusic.com [tpl]Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot[/tpl]

The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in Ireland, but they are most widely associated with combat operations in the American Revolutionary War.
About 30,000 German soldiers fought for the British during the American Revolutionary War. Nearly half were from the Hesse region of Germany; the others came from similar small German states. Several more German units were placed on garrison duty in the British Isles to free up British regulars for service in North America.Daniel Marston, The American Revolution 1774–1783 (Osprey Publishing, 2002)

The National Religious Party ([tpl]lang-he-n|מִפְלָגָה דָּתִית לְאֻומִּית[/tpl], Miflaga Datit Leumit, commonly known in Israel by its Hebrew acronym Mafdal, (Hebrew: מפד"ל)) was a political party in Israel representing the religious Zionist movement. Formed in 1956, at the time of its dissolution in 2008, it was the second oldest surviving party in the country after Agudat Yisrael, and was part of every government coalition until 1992. Traditionally a practical centrist party, in its later years it drifted to the right, becoming increasingly associated with Israeli settlers, and towards the end of its existence was part of a political alliance with the strongly right-wing National Union. The 2006 elections saw the party slump to just three seats, the worst electoral performance in its history. In November 2008 party members voted to disband the party in order to join the new Jewish Home party created by a merger of the NRP and most of the National Union factions.As NRP folds to create united front, signs of dissent emerge The Jerusalem Post, 19 November 2008 However, most of the National Union left the merger shortly after its implementation.

The Aramaic inscription: Ya'akov bar-Yosef akhui diYeshua (English translation: "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus") is cut into one side of the box.

Mother Ruby Muhammad (March 20, 1907 – March 2, 2011) was an African American religious figure known as the "Mother of the Nation of Islam." She was born in Sandersville, Georgia and grew up in Americus. No birth certificate exists to confirm her age, and it has been reported with significant disparity, although she claimed in newspaper interviews that she was born Ruby Macie Grayer on March 20, 1897. Recent research, however, suggests she was born in 1907, a decade later, based on the listing of Ruby Macie Grier, aged 3, in the 1910 census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/CalmentFraud.html|title=Ruby Muhammed Claims She Is 112 Years in Sacramento, CA|publisher=Gerontology Research Group|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-04|last=Prista Lucas|first=Filipe[/tpl]
Her mother died when she was very young, and she was raised by a woman she called her aunt, although she would later say that this woman was probably not her biological aunty. She did not know her father until she was a teenager. Community records in Sandersville, where she was born, indicate her father died at age 107 and her great-grandfather died at age 110.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/seniors/story/6745838p-7696920c.html|title=Seniors - Number of centenarians expected to double every decade|accessdate=2007-04-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070212084545/http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/seniors/story/6745838p-7696920c.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007[/tpl]

Mathilde Carré (30 June 1908 – 1970), known as "La Chatte", was a French Resistance agent during World War II who turned double agent.
Mathilde Carré was born in Le Creusot, Saône-et-Loire. In the 1930s she attended Sorbonne University and became a teacher. After her marriage, she moved to Algeria with her husband Maurice Carré, who was later killed in World War II, during the campaign of Italy.
She returned to France, worked as a nurse and witnessed the country fall to the Germans. In 1940, she met a Polish Air Force Captain named Roman Czerniawski cryptonymed "Walenty" to the Poles and "Armand" or "Victor" to the French. Carré, who had contacts with the Vichy Second Bureau, joined the headquarters section of his Franco-Polish Interallié espionage network based in Paris under the cryptonym "Victoire" (as all the headquarters section staff had "V" initial names, in a network which named its agents and their sectors or areas of coverage for Christian names grouped by the letters of the alphabet) although nicknamed La Chatte, ("The She-cat") for her feline predatory and stealthy propensities.
On 17 November 1941, the Abwehr's Hugo Bleicher arrested Czerniawski, Carré and many other members of Interallié; they had been uncovered when an informant in Normandy had been exposed to the Gestapo. She was interrogated by him, threatened with death and also offered financial reward, she agreed to become a double agent herself and revealed all of the members of the network known to her. She began to work for Germans continuing to use the code name Victoire. She may also have become Bleicher's mistress.
According to Pierre de Vomécourt, an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), he and a Resistance contact began to suspect her. When he confronted Carré, who had become his mistress, she confessed and together they planned to outwit the Abwehr.
She claimed she convinced Bleicher, and through him, his superiors, to send her to London to infiltrate the SOE. In February 1942, she was exfiltrated to London with de Vomécourt. MI5 interrogated her about Abwehr techniques and played back her radio link for a period until her usefulness was exhausted, whereupon she was arrested and taken first to HM Prison Holloway and then to HM Prison Aylesbury for the rest of the war, where she acted as an informant against other detainees.
After the war Carré was deported to France where she faced charges for treason. At the trial, which started on 3 January 1949, the prosecution read from her diary: "What I wanted most was a good meal, a man, and, once more, Mozart's Requiem."Time: La Chatte Despite being defended by her wartime commander, Paul Archard, she was sentenced to death on 7 January 1949.  Three months later, the sentence was commuted to 20 years in jail.
Mathilde Carré was released in September 1954. She published an account of her life in J'ai été "La Chatte" (1959; revised in 1975 as On m'appelait la Chatte ("I Was Called The Cat")), in which she denied many claims that had been made about her and her activities during the war. She soon fell out of public view. In 1980 her book Ainsi vécut Marie, jeune-fille de Nazareth, mère du Christ was published.Mathilde Bélard Carré: Ainsi vécut Marie, jeune-fille de Nazareth, mère du Christ, with a preamble from 1976 by Père Michel Riquet, S.J., Limoges, Droguet et Ardant, ca 1980 Mathilde Carré died in 1970 in Paris.

Hugo Ernst Bleicher (9 August 1899 - August 1982) was a German senior non-commissioned officer of the Abwehr who worked against French Resistance in German-occupied France.
Bleicher was born in Tettnang. He served as a private soldier in the First World War in the pioneer gas corps and was captured near the Somme. He was held as a Prisoner of War in 165 POW Camp near Abbéville and succeeded in escaping four times, although he was never able to return to the German lines. He is misreported as having been taken prisoner by the British in Belgium as a spy when wearing a British uniform. After the war he became a businessman but was recruited into the Abwehr during the Second World War because of his knowledge of French and Spanish. However, he never rose above the rank of Feldwebel.
Bleicher was ruthless in his pursuit of anyone in France who opposed German domination. He disabled the Franco-Polish "Interallié" network, and captured both Polish Air Force Captain Roman Czerniawski and some of his headquarters staff, one of whom was Mathilde Carré, who had contacts with the Vichy 2nd Bureau. She reportedly became Bleicher's lover, betrayed everyone she knew in the network, and agreed to act as an Abwehr agent. Subsequently, she changed sides again and betrayed her dealings with the Abwehr to MI5, who used her radio link for deception purposes for a period in conjunction with the Poles and the SIS and then imprisoned her when her usefulness had ceased, until the end of the war.
In March 1943, Bleicher arrested André Marsac, a member of the resistance organisation known as Carte. Masquerading, on his own initiative, as a German intelligence colonel attempting to defect to the Allies, he deceived Marsac and his associate Roger Bardet, and in April 1943 succeeded in capturing SOE agents Peter Churchill and Odette Sansom. Both Churchill and Sansom were subjected to brutal treatment and torture during interrogation before being transferred to a concentration camp, although none of this was carried out by Bleicher himself.
Bleicher persuaded Bardet to work for him. As a result of this, in July 1944 Bleicher captured Henri Frager, another former Carte member who had been commissioned by the SOE as leader of its Donkeyman circuit.
He was also associated with SOE agent Henri Dericourt (Farrier), who was a double agent as well for the Sicherheitsdienst.
Hugo Bleicher, together with two of his French Abwehr agents Jean Rocquefort and Francois Barbier, was arrested in Amsterdam on 15 May 1945 by the Dutch NBS, who interrogated him for two weeks on his activities in the Netherlands before handing him over to the 1st Canadian Army, who interrogated him for a further period, also on his operations in the Netherlands, before handing him over to the British authorities, who transferred him on 16 June 1945 to the UK for longer term interrogation at Camp 020, where he co-operated willingly with his MI5 interrogators. He was handed over to the French government on 12 October 1945, and they subsequently placed him on trial and imprisoned him, as they also did with Mathilde Carré.
In 1954, he published his memoirs, Colonel Henri's story. Bleicher (sometimes misreported as Bliechert) actively employed the aliases Jean Verbeck and Colonel Henri (often misreported as Colonel Heinrich). He held, but never used, identity papers in the name of Jean Castel. He landed in the UK under the Canadian supplied alias of Charles Davidson, and has been misreported as using the names von Stahlen, Henri Bothereau or Gottschalk. He was decorated by the Abwehr with the War Merit Cross 1st Class for his services.

Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière (October 29, 1765 – April 9, 1845) was a French general who fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.
Gazan started his military career as a cannonier in the French Coast Guard. He was later appointed to the Royal Life Guards and, upon the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, he joined the French National Guard. After service in the Upper Rhine valley and the Netherlands, he joined André Masséna in Switzerland in 1799, and fought at the battles of Winterthur and First Zurich. In August 1805, Gazan commanded of a division of the Army that encircled the Austrians in Ulm. On November 11, under Joseph Mortier, his division provided the advance guard in the advance on Vienna. Mortier over-extended his line of march and Gazan's division was surrounded by Kutuzov's Coalition army; Gazan lost 40 percent of his force in the Battle of Dürenstein. Following the Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, he transferred with Jean Lannes to the Iberian peninsula. There he participated in the French capture of Zaragoza and in several important actions of the long Peninsular War, including the Battle of Albuera and the Battle of Vitoria.
During the Hundred Days, Gazan eventually joined Napoleon's cause, although he did not have a field command.  In 1815, he judged Michel Ney's trial for treason, but refused to reach a verdict. He dabbled briefly, and unsuccessfully, in politics in the 1820s. In 1830, He was raised to the French peerage and held a divisional command in Marsailles, but by then was an old man, and he retired in 1832. He died in 1845.

[[Communists in the United States Labor Movement (1919–37)]]
CATEGORIES: History of labor relations in the United States, Communism in the United States

The Communist Party and its allies played an important role in the United States labor movement, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but never succeeded, with rare exceptions, either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda of fighting for socialism and full workers' control over industry, or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO's expulsion of the unions in which they held the most influence in 1950. After the expulsion of the Communists, organized labor in the United States began a steady decline.
Historians disagree why the union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers in the last ninety years. Some[tpl]Who|date=December 2009[/tpl] have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others[tpl]Who|date=December 2009[/tpl] have attributed the left's failure to its own successes in building strong unions, but at the cost of downplaying its own political and social agendas for the sake of unity or short-term gains. Others[tpl]Who|date=December 2009[/tpl] take just the opposite position: that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by its ideological zig-zags. The CP's history within the labor movement can support all of these thesis.

Specialty Records was an American record label based in Los Angeles. It was originally launched as Juke Box Records in 1946, but later renamed by its owner Art Rupe when he parted company with a couple of his original partners.  Specialty is noted for the rhythm and blues, blues, gospel and early rock and roll music recorded by the label.
The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert "Bumps" Blackwell, Johnny Vincent and J. W. Alexander.
Art Rupe was known for being one of the most honest owners of an independent R&B record company in the 1950s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]  He was known for paying his artists, recording them well, and allowing some of the wildest R&B to be issued on any label of the day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]  He was also known for hating the payola environment at the time and never paid it, which probably hindered some potential sales.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
Specialty also had two music publishing companies, Venice Music for BMI licensed songs and Greenwich Music for ASCAP licensed songs.
The record label was sold to Fantasy Records in 1991 and is now part of the Concord Music Group.  The music publishing unit was sold to Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

[[Lakeside, Cumbria]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Cumbria

Lakeside is a small settlement at the south end of Windermere, England. Now in the English county of Cumbria, before county reorganisation of 1974 it was in Lancashire, as part of the region known as Furness. It was established as a steamer pier for services along the lake when the Lakeside branch of the Furness Railway reached it in 1869, meaning that steamer services no longer had to negotiate the River Leven to Newby Bridge. Also built at Lakeside was a hotel to serve the tourists brought by the railway and steamers.
The steamers still call at Lakeside and the railway is now a steam-hauled heritage railway, operated as the Lakeside & Haverthwaite Railway. However, it now only operates as far as Haverthwaite, with the route beyond to Ulverston closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts.
It now contains the Aquarium of the Lakes, an aquarium featuring fish found in the rivers and seas around the Lake District.
In November 2009 the village was partially flooded including Lakeside Hotel and the Lakes Aquarium which resulted in the closure of both businesses until early 2010 as well as the sinking of moored yachts and severe road blockages.

[[Fraser spiral illusion]]

CATEGORIES: Optical illusions

The Fraser spiral illusion is an optical illusion that was first described by the British psychologist Sir James Fraser (1863 – 1936) in 1908. 
The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion. The overlapping black arc segments appear to form a spiral; however, the arcs are a series of concentric circles.
The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands). Zöllner's illusion and the café wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations.
The illusion is augmented by the spiral components in the checkered background.

[[States Records]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct record labels of the United States

States Record Company was a  Chicago-based record label. A subsidiary of United Records, it was in business from May 1952 to December 1957.  States focused on rhythm and blues, jazz, and gospel.
States was operated by Leonard Allen and Lew Simpkins until Simpkins' death in April 1953; thereafter, Allen was solely responsible for the company.Pruter, Robert, Campbell, Robert L. and Kelly, Tom "The United and States Labels Part I" Accessed August 13, 2009
Most sessions for States were done at Universal Recording, with high-fidelity results.
The most important blues artist to record for States was Junior Wells, making his debut as a leader; he cut sessions for the company in 1953 and 1954.  In the down-home category, Allen also released singles by Robert Nighthawk and Big Walter Horton, as well as pianist Eddie Ware, guitarist L. C. McKinley, and drummer James Bannister.  Standup blues singers to record for the label included Edward "The Great Gates" White (accompanied on his outing by Tom Archia and Red Saunders), Cliff Butler, Arbee Stidham, Jack Cooley, and Harold Burrage.
States issued juke-box jazz sides by tenor saxophonists Paul Bascomb, Jimmy Coe, and Cozy Eggleston. A few forays into the Detroit scene produced rhythm and blues by Sax Kari, Jimmy Hamilton, T. J. Fowler, and Helen Thompson. States became involved in doo-wop in 1953 when Allen recorded The Hornets.  He soon added The Danderliers, the Five Chances, The Strollers and The Palms.
The vocal groups were rehearsed by Al Smith, who also led studio bands featuring such performers as guitarist Lefty Bates, tenor saxophonist Red Holloway, and drummer Vernel Fournier. In gospel, The Caravans were a mainstay of the label throughout its existence.  Eventually, Allen added the Genesa Smith Singers and the Lucy Smith Singers.
Allen did less recording after 1954, and closed both of his labels around the end of 1957.Pruter, Robert, Campbell, Robert L., and Kelly, Tom. "The United and States Labels Part II" Accessed August 26, 2009  States releases ran consecutively from 101 to 164, for a total of 64 singles on the label.
States relied heavily on The Caravans, releasing 14 singles on them and compiling many more unissued tracks.  After the company closed, Savoy Records, which had signed the group and was seeking to consolidate its position in gospel music, bought this rich cache of material.  States' remaining output was acquired in 1975 by Bob Koester of Delmark Records, and has been included in comprehensive reissue programs.

Nevertheless, hopes for restoration of Polish independence were kept alive throughout the 19th century by events within and outside the Polish lands. Poland's location on the Northern European Lowlands became especially important in a period when its expansionist neighbors, the Kingdom of Prussia and Tsarist Russia, were intensely involved in European rivalries and alliances and modern nation-states took form over the entire continent.

The first notable Alcmaeonid was Megacles, who was the Archon Eponymous of Athens in the 7th century BC. He was responsible for killing the followers of Cylon of Athens during the attempted coup of 632 BC, as Cylon had taken refuge as a suppliant at the temple of Athena. As a result of their actions, Megacles and his Alcmaeonid followers were the subject of an ongoing curse and were exiled from the city. Even the bodies of buried Alcmaeonidae were dug up and removed from the city limits.
The Alcmaeonids were allowed back into the city in 594 BC, during the archonship of Solon.See Gomme, A Historical Commentary on Athens, on 1.126.12. Megacles' son Alcmaeon held command during the first Sacred War: Plutarch, Solon 11.2. During the tyranny of Pisistratus, the Alcmaeonid Megacles married his daughter to Pisistratus, but when the tyrant refused to have children with her, Megacles banished him. Later the Alcmaeonids would claim to have been exiled following Pisistratus' return in 546 BC so as to distance themselves from possible accusations of complicity, but epigraphic evidence in fact proves that Cleisthenes was archon for the year 525-4. Megacles was able to marry (for a second or third time) Agarista, the daughter of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon. They had two sons, Hippocrates and Cleisthenes, the reformer of the Athenian democracy. Hippocrates' daughter was Agariste, the mother of Pericles. 
This Cleisthenes overthrew Hippias, the son and successor of Pisistratus, in 508 BC. He had bribed the oracle at Delphi (which the Alcmaeonidae had helped to build while they were in exile) to convince the Spartans to help him, which they reluctantly did. Cleisthenes was, at first, opposed by some who felt the curse made the Alcmaeonidae ineligible to rule; the Spartan king Cleomenes I even turned against Cleisthenes and the latter was briefly exiled once more. However, the citizens called for Cleisthenes to return, and the restored Alcmaeonids were responsible for laying the foundations of Athenian democracy. 
The Alcmaeonidae were said to have negotiated for an alliance with the Persians during the Persian Wars, despite the fact that Athens was leading the resistance to the Persian invasion. Pericles and Alcibiades also belonged to the Alcmaeonidae, and during the Peloponnesian War the Spartans referred to the family's curse in an attempt to discredit Pericles. Alcibiades, as the previous generation of Alcmaeonidae had done, tried to ally with the Persians after he was accused of impiety. The family disappeared after Athens's defeat in the Peloponnesian War.

Tennessee Records (along with the Republic label) was owned by Alan and Reynolds Bubis. Legendary songwriter and producer Ted Jarrett was head of A&R. The labels were out of business by the mid-1950s when the three men went into partnership to start the Calvert-Champion-Cherokee group of labels. Those labels were defunct by 1960 and the Bubis Brothers got out of the music business. Ted Jarrett continued on with his Valdot, Poncello, Ref-O-Ree and Tee-Jaye labels, remaining active in the music business until his death in 2009.

Fiordland is a geographic region of New Zealand that is situated on the south-western corner of the South Island, comprising the western-most third of Southland. Most of Fiordland is dominated by the steep sides of the snow-capped Southern Alps, deep lakes and its ocean-flooded, steep western valleys. Indeed, the name "Fiordland" comes from a variant spelling of the Scandinavian word for this type of steep valley, "fjord". 
Fiordland features a number of fiords (often named sounds), of which Milford Sound is the most famous, though Doubtful Sound is even larger and has more, and longer, branches (but is also less accessible). Situated within Fiordland are Browne Falls and Sutherland Falls, which rank among the tallest waterfalls in the world and New Zealand's three deepest lakes, Lake Hauroko, Lake Manapouri, and Lake Te Anau. This part of New Zealand has a very wet climate, receiving 6,300mm of rainfall per year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

The Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph is a large Roman Catholic church located in Downtown San Jose.  The minor basilica is the cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California. The basilica is named for Saint Joseph, patron saint of the universal church.
The original St. Joseph's Church was built on the site of the current basilica in 1803, and was the first non-mission parish built in California.  The original adobe structure was damaged by earthquakes in 1818 and 1822, and a new adobe church was built from  1835 to 1846. The second church was severely damaged by the 1868 Hayward earthquake, and work on the third church began in 1869.  The third church was destroyed by fire in 1875, and a temporary fourth church was built a few blocks away while the fifth and current church was being constructed.  The fifth church was dedicated by Joseph Alemany, Archbishop of San Francisco, in 1877 while construction continued.  The current portico was completed in 1884, and the large dome was finished in 1885.
In 1981, a major renovation project was begun at the church, which was to become the cathedral for the new Roman Catholic Bishop of San Jose.  In 1985, the church was elevated to a cathedral, pending completion of the restoration in 1990. It replaced Saint Patrick Proto-Cathedral Parish, located a few blocks away, as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was made a minor basilica by Pope John Paul II in 1997.
The Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph is listed as a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid=89

It was founded in AD 910 when the Christian princes of Asturias along the northern coast of the peninsula shifted their capital from Oviedo to the city of León. The County of Portugal separated to become the independent Kingdom of Portugal in 1139 and the eastern, inland part of León was joined to the Kingdom of Castile in 1230.
From 1296 to 1301, the Kingdom of León was again independent and after the re-union with Castile remained a kingdom until 1833, but as part of a united Spain. In the Royal Decree of 30 November 1833, the Kingdom of León was considered one of the Spanish regions and divided into the provinces of León, Zamora and Salamanca. In 1978, these three provinces of the region of León were included along with six provinces of the historic region of Old Castile to create the autonomous community of Castile and León.

[[Classical orthogonal polynomials]]

CATEGORIES: Articles containing proofs, Orthogonal polynomials, Special hypergeometric functions

In mathematics, the classical orthogonal polynomials are the most widely used orthogonal polynomials: the Hermite polynomials, Laguerre polynomials, Jacobi polynomials (including as a special case the Gegenbauer polynomials), Chebyshev polynomials, and Legendre polynomials.See [tpl]harvtxt|Suetin|2001[/tpl]
They have many important applications in such areas as mathematical physics (in particular, the theory of random matrices), approximation theory, numerical analysis, and many others.
Classical orthogonal polynomials appeared in the early 19th century in the works of Adrien-Marie Legendre,  who introduced the Legendre polynomials. In the late 19th century, the study of continued fractions by P. L. Chebyshev and then A.A. Markov and T.J. Stieltjes led to the general notion of orthogonal polynomials.
There are several more general definitions of orthogonal classical polynomials; for example, [tpl]harvtxt|Andrews|Askey|1985[/tpl] use the term for all polynomials in the Askey scheme.

The Phrygian cap is a soft conical cap with the top pulled forward, associated in antiquity with the inhabitants of Phrygia, a region of central Anatolia. In early modern Europe it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty, through a confusion with the pileus, the felt cap of manumitted (emancipated) slaves of ancient Rome. Accordingly, the Phrygian cap is sometimes called a liberty cap; in artistic representations it signifies freedom and the pursuit of liberty.

Atossa ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἄτοσσα[/tpl], from Old Persian *Utauθa, in Avestan: Hutaosā) was an Achaemenid queen and daughter of Cyrus the Great and Cassandane. She lived from 550 BC to 475 BC and probably was a sister of the Persian king Cambyses II. 
Atossa married Darius I during 522 BC after he, with the help of the nobleman Otanes, defeated the followers of a man claiming to be Bardiya (Smerdis), the younger brother of Cambyses II.
Herodotus records in The Histories that Atossa was troubled by a bleeding lump in her breast. She wrapped herself in sheets and sought a self-imposed quarantine. Ultimately, a Greek slave, Democedes, persuaded her to allow him to excise the tumor. Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies, p.41. See Herodotus, The Histories, OUP, 1998, pt. VIII 
Xerxes I was the eldest son of Atossa and Darius. Atossa lived to see Xerxes invade Greece. Being a direct descendent of Cyrus the Great, Atossa had a great authority within Achamenian royal house and court. Atossa's special position enabled Xerxes, who was not the eldest son of Darius, to succeed his father.[ref]

Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings, CM (July 29, 1938 – August 7, 2005) was a Canadian American journalist and news anchor. He was the sole anchor of ABC's World News Tonight from 1983 until his death in 2005 of complications from lung cancer. A high-school dropout, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.
Jennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at the age of nine. He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting a teen dance show, Saturday Date, on Saturdays.
In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. His inexperience was attacked by critics and others in television news, making for a difficult first stint in the anchor chair. Jennings became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East.
He returned as one of World News Tonight's three anchors in 1978, and was promoted to the role of sole anchor in 1983. Jennings was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 or more hours straight to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, the Millennium celebrations in 2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates. Having always been fascinated with the United States, Jennings became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003.
Along with Tom Brokaw at NBC and Dan Rather at CBS, Jennings formed part of the "Big Three" news anchors who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw and Rather.

BC Rail [tpl]Reporting marks|BCOL, BCIT[/tpl], known as the British Columbia Railway between 1972 and 1984 and as the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (PGE) before 1972, was a railway that operated in the Canadian province of British Columbia between 1912 and 2004. It was a class II regional railway and the third-largest in Canada, operating [tpl]convert|2,320|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of mainline track. Its operations were owned by the public as a crown corporation from 1918 until 2004, when the provincial government leased operations for 990 years to CN.Premier's chief of staff tells court he did not recall BC Rail making profits before sale, Neal Hall, Vancouver Sun, June 10, 2010About BC Rail: Facts & Figures. BC Rail. Retrieved on December 6, 2002.  The track and other assets, including a marine division and stevedoring subsidiary as well as large tracts of real estate, remain under public ownership.  40 km of track serving the Roberts Bank Superport that were scheduled to be sold to OmniTRAX remain under BC Rail management due to that sale being cancelled because of the transaction being tainted by an influence-peddling and bribery scandal resulting in convictions in 2010.  The provincial government, which promised when originally elected to never sell the railway, has announced that the crown corporation and its remaining operations and assets would be "wound down" and taken over by various departments of the Ministry of Transportation The details of the sale/lease to CN, which are related to the OmniTRAX affair, have become the subject of protracted public inquiry as part of the proceedings of the trial surrounding a scandal known as the British Columbia Legislature Raids Affair, or "Railgate". Government leaders and civil servants involved with the arrangements to CN have refused to comment on the deal because the matter "is before the courts".
Chartered in 1912, the railway was acquired by the provincial government in 1918 after running into financial difficulties. A railway that ran "from nowhere, to nowhere" for over 30 years, neither passing through any major city nor interchanging with any other railway, its southern terminus was at Squamish and its northern terminus at Clinton during that period.  It expanded significantly between 1949 and 1984. Primarily a freight railway, it also offered passenger service, as well as some excursion services, most notably the Royal Hudson excursion train. The railway's operations only reached profitability in 1980, due to large capital and operating debts, which were intended as subsidies to develop and sustain mining and timber economies and employment in the regions it accessed, though during the 1980s it regularly posted significant profits, contributing to the public treasury significantly, and maintained a lower operating debt than any of the continent's other major railways.  The railway's operations and management, as one of the province's largest crown corporations, have necessarily been at the centre of public debate since its takeover.  Notably, as example, the Social Credit governments of WAC Bennett and his son Bill Bennett forgave the railways' capital debts in 1954 and 1979, respectively, with bookkeeping matters related to that bringing much criticism.   The current provincial government has been accused of fabricating falsehoods about the state of its debts and viability in order to justify the deal with CN, claiming the railway was in disarray.Liberals, Stop Lying about BC Rail, Will McMartin, The Tyee, March 29, 2010  Other participants in the bidding process withdrew their bids, saying that CN had unfair access to confidential information about their own operations, provided by the government, and at least one bidder (Canadian Pacific) privately stated in since-released communications that the bid was "rigged".  Controversy over CN's management of the line has focused on layoffs, toxic spills and other safety concerns, and cuts in service to some regions.  The line has generated profits for CN in the range of $25 million per year since its takeover of the railway's operations.

[[Agriculture in Mesoamerica]]

CATEGORIES: Agriculture in Mesoamerica, Mesoamerican diet and subsistence, History of agriculture

Agriculture in Mesoamerica dates to the Archaic period of Mesoamerican chronology (8000-2000 BCE).  During this period, many of the hunter gatherer micro-bands in the region began to cultivate wild plants.  The cultivation of these plants probably started out as creating increased surplus and known areas of fall back, or starvation foods, near seasonal camps, that the band could rely on when hunting was bad, or when there was a drought. The plants could have been brought purposely, or by accident. The former could have been done by bringing a wild plant food closer to a camp site, or to a frequented area, so it was easier to get to or collect. The latter could have happened as certain plant seeds were eaten and not fully digested, causing these plants to grow wherever human habitation would take them.  By creating these known areas of plant food, it would have been easier for the band to be in the right place, at the right time, to collect them.  
As the Archaic period moved on, these cultivated plant foods became more and more important to the people of Mesoamerica.  The reliability of the cultivated plant foods would allow the micro-bands to increase in size. These larger bands would require more food, and that would lead to even greater reliance on purposely-cultivated plant foods.  Eventually, a subsistence pattern, based on plant cultivation, supplemented with small game hunting, became much more reliable, efficient, and generated a larger yield.  As agriculture grew to become a larger part of the Mesoamerican diet, the people would have increasingly settled down in permanent villages and developed increased division of labor and social stratification as surplus grew.
Another group to consider in the origins of Mesoamerican agriculture is the sedentary fishers.  These people would have already lived in semi-permanent villages, and could have experimented with cultivating wild plants to supplement their shellfish diet.  As cultivation became more focused, many plant species became domesticated. These plants were no longer able to reproduce on their own, and many of their physical traits were being modified by human farmers.  The most famous of these, and the most important to Mesoamerican agriculture, is maize.

A Frenchman who also worked in the United Kingdom and the United States, Le Prince conducted his ground-breaking work in 1888 in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.
In October 1888, Le Prince filmed moving picture sequences Roundhay Garden Scene and a Leeds Bridge street scene using his single-lens camera and Eastman's paper film.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/~/media/Files/NMeM/PDF/Collections/Cinematography/PioneersOfEarlyCinemaLouisLePrince.ashx|format=PDF| title=Pioneers of Early Cinema: 1, AIMÉ AUGUSTIN LE PRINCE (1841-1890?)| pages=2| publisher=www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk| quote=he developed a single-lens camera which he used to make moving picture sequences at the Whitley family home in Roundhay and of Leeds Bridge in October 1888. ... it has been claimed that a photograph of a drowned man in the Paris police archives is that of Le Prince.| accessdate=2012-11-25[/tpl] These were several years before the work of competing inventors such as Auguste and Louis Lumière and Thomas Edison.
He was never able to perform a planned public demonstration in the United States because he mysteriously vanished from a train on 16 September 1890. His body and luggage were never found, but, over a century later, a police archive was found to contain a photograph of a drowned man who could have been him. 
Not long after Le Prince's disappearance, Thomas Edison tried to take credit for the invention. But Le Prince’s widow and son, Adolphe, were keen to advance his cause as the inventor of cinematography. In 1898 Adolphe appeared as a witness for the defence in a court case brought by Edison against the American Mutoscope Company, claiming that Edison was the first and sole inventor of cinematography (and thus entitled to royalties for the use of the process). He was not allowed to present the two cameras as evidence (and so establish Le Prince’s prior claim as inventor) and eventually the court ruled in favour of Edison; a year later that ruling was overturned.http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/~/media/Files/NMeM/PDF/Collections/Cinematography/PioneersOfEarlyCinemaLouisLePrince.ashx

The Federated Malay States (FMS) was a federation of four protected states in the Malay Peninsula—Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang—established by the British government in 1895, which lasted until 1946, when they, together with the Straits Settlements and the Unfederated Malay States, formed the Malayan Union. Two years later, the Union became the Federation of Malaya and finally Malaysia in 1963 with the inclusion of Sabah (then North Borneo), Sarawak and Singapore.
The United Kingdom was responsible for foreign affairs and defence of the federation, whilst the states continued to be responsible for their domestic policies. Even so, the British Resident General would give advice on domestic issues, and the states were bound by treaty to follow that advice. The federation had Kuala Lumpur, which was then part of Selangor, as its capital. The first FMS Resident General was Sir Frank Swettenham.
The federation, along with the other Malay states and British possessions of the peninsular, was overrun and occupied by the Japanese during World War II.  After the liberation of Malaya following the Japanese surrender, the federation was not restored, but the federal form of government was retained as the principal model for consolidating the separate States as an independent Federation of Malaya and the Federation's later evolution into Malaysia.

The Grey Wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) is a small member of the wagtail family,  Motacillidae. The species looks similar to the Yellow Wagtail but has the yellow on its underside restricted to the throat and vent. Breeding males have a black throat. The species is widely distributed, with several populations breeding in Europe and Asia and migrating to tropical regions in Asia and Africa. They are usually seen on open marshy ground or meadows where they walk solitarily or in pairs along the ground, capturing insects that are disturbed. Like other wagtails, they frequently wag their tail and fly low with undulations and they have a sharp call that is often given in flight.

The Western Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava) is a small passerine in the wagtail family Motacillidae, which also includes the pipits and longclaws.
This species breeds in much of temperate Europe and  Asia. It is resident in the milder parts of its range, such as western Europe, but northern and eastern populations migrate to Africa and south Asia.
It is a slender 15–16 cm long bird, with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. It is the shortest tailed of the European wagtails. The breeding adult male is basically olive above and yellow below. In other plumages, the yellow may be diluted by white. The heads of breeding males come in a variety of colours and patterns depending on subspecies.
The call is a characteristic high-pitched jeet.Wiles et al. (2000)
This insectivorous bird inhabits open country near water, such as wet meadows. It nests in tussocks, laying 4-8 speckled eggs.

The second US Navy ship to bear the name, she was named for Peyton Randolph, president of the First Continental Congress. Randolph was commissioned in October 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning three battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career she operated exclusively in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Caribbean. In the early 1960s she served as the recovery ship for two Project Mercury space missions, including John Glenn's historic first orbital flight.

The Citrine Wagtail or Yellow-headed Wagtail (Motacilla citreola) is a small songbird in the family Motacillidae.  The term citrine refers to its yellowish colouration.  Its systematics, phylogeny and taxonomy are subject of considerable debate in the early 21st century. This is because this bird forms a cryptic species complex with the Eastern (M. tschutschensis ) and  Western Yellow Wagtail (M. flava). Which of the many taxa in this group should properly refer to which population is unlikely to be resolved in the immediate future.
It is a slender, 15.5–17 cm long bird, with the long, constantly wagging tail characteristic of the genus Motacilla. The adult male in breeding plumage is basically grey or black above, with white on the remiges, and bright yellow below and on the entire head except for the black nape. In winter plumage, its yellow underparts may be diluted by white, and the head is brownish with a yellowish supercilium. Females look generally like washed-out versions of males in winter plumage.
This species breeds in north central Asia in wet meadows and tundra. It migrates in winter to south Asia, often to highland areas. Its range is expanding westwards, and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe. Vagrants seem to extend the migration rather than straying en route; in Bhutan for example, though along one of the species' migration flyways, the Citrine Wagtail has been recorded as an extremely rare passer-by rather than staying even for a few days or weeks.
It is an insectivorous bird of open country near water, such as wet meadows and bogs, and nests on the ground, laying 4–5 speckled eggs.

[[Felix Wakefield]]
CATEGORIES: 1807 births, 1875 deaths, New Zealand surveyors, New Zealand farmers, British military personnel of the Crimean War

Felix Wakefield, (30 November 1807 – 28 March 1875), was the seventh child of Edward Wakefield (1774–1854) and Susanna Crash (d. 1816) of Felstead, he was the brother of Arthur and Edward Gibbon Wakefield.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle = Wakefield, Edward (1774-1854)|first =Cæsar Litton |last  =Falkiner|authorlink = Cæsar Litton Falkiner|volume = 59[/tpl]  In 1831 he married Marie Bailley, by whom he had nine children.
When he left school Felix began working with his father and training as a surveyor and civil engineer. This was interrupted, however, in 1826 as a result of the scandal surrounding his brothers, Edward Gibbon and William Wakefield and also his stepmother. When he eventually finished his training he rejoined his father, now in exile in Blois, France. Soon afterwards he impregnated a servant girl, Marie Bailley and was required to marry her. In 1832 the young family emigrated to Tasmania where Felix was employed as a surveyor.  Although initially successful, Felix's work did not impress the authorities and such was his personality that when criticized he usually resorted to litigation and argument.  As a result of this, he became extremely unpopular and eventually unemployable. Various attempts to recoup his fortunes were unsuccessful and by 1846 the family was destitute. Abandoning his wife and youngest child in Tasmania, Felix took the other eight children and returned to England.
Most of the responsibility for supporting the family fell on his older sister, Catherine Torlesse, and brother, Edward Gibbon, who was himself recovering from a major stroke. But Edward Gibbon was also involved in the promotion and planning of a new scheme for the colonization of New Zealand, the Canterbury Association, under the auspices of the Church of England and he persuaded himself that his brother Felix and his surveying skills had a contribution to make. The plan that Felix drew up for surveying the Canterbury Plains was largely adopted and contributed significantly to the early success of the colony. However it was not easy, as Felix was just as hard to work with in England as he had been in Tasmania.
Eventually relations between the brothers were so bad that Edward Gibbon more or less wrote off his brother's debts, paid him a substantial sum of money, and sent him off to New Zealand. He arrived with six of his children in November, 1851 and immediately began feuding with the agents of the Canterbury Association about the land allocated to him. There were also questions about various sums of money that he was unable to account for satisfactorily. A few months later he leased the store at Redcliffs, installed his children in the care of his eldest daughter, Constance, now twenty years old, and departed for Wellington.
In Wellington he met up with another brother, Daniel Bell Wakefield, resumed his campaign against Edward Gibbon, and started a new campaign aiming to have the administrators of the Canterbury Settlement replaced. Then at the end of March, after less than five months in the colony, he returned to London. There he continued his vendettas with such vehemence that he was summoned to appear in court, charged with uttering threats against the Canterbury Association's Land Agent, John Robert Godley. And then, just as precipitately, he returned to New Zealand.
He arrived in Nelson, New Zealand in 1854, bringing with him two red deer. They thrived in New Zealand and went on to destroy much of the country's native forests. Felix returned to Canterbury where here his welcome was very cool. By August he was again in trouble, this time for attempting to evict the tenant from a building owned by his nephew, Jerningham Wakefield. Shortly afterwards he quit Canterbury, this time taking his children with him and returned to Nelson where they stayed for a short while before sailing once again back to England.
He stayed away from New Zealand for ten years, during much of the time he was involved in litigation over various issues about land in New Zealand.   He also served in the Crimean War, acting briefly as an engineer on the construction of the Balaclava Railway.  He may also have been involved in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.   
Finally in January 1864 he returned to New Zealand, this time bringing with him a flock of skylarks. He settled in Nelson for a while, tried Canterbury for a period and then moved on to Wellington and then back once again to Nelson where in 1870 he was employed as a post office clerk until he retired in 1874.  Wakefield died of a heart attack on 23 December 1875.
His son Edward Wakefield was a New Zealand politician and journalist.

Vogue Records was a short-lived United States-based record label of the 1940s, noted for the artwork embedded in the records themselves. Founded in 1946 as part of Sav-Way Industries of Detroit, Michigan, the discs were initially a hit, because of the novelty of the colorful artwork, and the improved sound compared to the shellac records dominant at the time.  The discs were manufactured by first sandwiching printed illustrations around a core of aluminum, then coating both sides with clear vinyl upon which the grooves were stamped.
The company went out of business the following year, having released between 67 and 74 double-sided 78 rpm gramophone records.  Some of the Vogue issues were re-releases of recordings originally issued by other companies. 
The colorful artwork on the records have made Vogue Records a collector's item.
Two releases on the Vogue label have been the source of much collector debate over the years: the 1946 releases by the country swing group the Down Homers "Who's Gonna Kiss You When I'm Gone?" and "Boogie Woogie Yodel" have often been cited as featuring the earliest recorded performances by future rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley, who was a member of the group in 1946. However this rumor was later debunked by surviving members of the Down Homers as well as Haley researchers.http://thegardnerfamily.org/haley/discography/recordings.html Nonetheless, the Vogue Down Homers releases are considered among the more collectable of the label's releases.

Tsang began his civil service career in 1967, occupying various positions in finance and trade in the Hong Kong Civil Service, and was appointed Financial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1995, becoming the first ethnic Hong Konger to hold the position under British administration.[tpl]cite news|title=A Rarity in Hong Kong: Budget Is in Deficit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/07/business/a-rarity-in-hong-kong-budget-is-in-deficit.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 March 1996|agency=Reuters[/tpl] He remained in that position after the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong before being appointed Chief Secretary for Administration after the resignation of Anson Chan. Tsang was praised for his handling of the Hong Kong economy both as Chief Executive in the mid-2000s and as Financial Secretary in the late 1990s.BBC Profile: Donald Tsang Tsang was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in June 1997 hours before the handover.Tsang was a Commonwealth citizen (specifically, British Dependent Territories Citizen) at the time his honour was conferred, so his membership in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is substantive and not honorary. Although an ordinary KBE is entitled to style himself as 'Sir', Tsang did not use the title in his official capacity http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E0DF1230F935A25751C0A9679C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tsang,%20Donald,http://www.economist.com/background/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9359174. Like other Hong Kong officials, he appeared on Hong Kong Government publications and websites as "The Honourable Donald TSANG, GBM" without the title 'Sir' http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2004/en/app_01.htm. The British Government states it has no policy on the use of Donald Tsang's title, which derives from the KBE status awarded to him in 1997 for his 30-year service to Hong Kong and that it is for the individual concerned to decide whether they use or wish to be known by their title. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050712/text/50712w09.htm#50712w09.html_sbhd3http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4091570.
He assumed the office of Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2005. After his appointment, he was criticised for the government's mishandling of a number of incidents, most notably the demolition of Queen's Pier, Political Appointments System, the Leung Chin-man appointment controversy, and the Employee Retraining Levy waiver controversy.

The Cayuse are a Native American tribe in the state of Oregon in the United States. The Cayuse tribe shares a reservation and government in northeastern Oregon with the Umatilla and the Walla Walla tribes as part of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. The reservation is located near Pendleton, Oregon at the base of the Blue Mountains.
The Cayuse called themselves the Liksiyu in the Cayuse language. Originally located in present-day northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, they lived adjacent to territory occupied by the Nez Perce and had close associations with them. Like the Plains tribes, the Cayuse placed a high premium on warfare and were skilled horsemen. They developed the Cayuse pony. The Cayuse ceded most of their traditional territory to the United States in 1855 by treaty and moved to the Umatilla Reservation, where they have formed a confederated tribe.

[[Cinema of the Czech Republic]]
CATEGORIES: Cinema of the Czech Republic, Cinema of Czechoslovakia

The Czech Republic (both as an independent country and as a part of former Czechoslovakia) was a seedbed for many acclaimed film directors. 
The first Czech film director and cinematographer was Jan Kříženecký, who since the second half of the 90s of 19th century filmed short documentaries called "Newsreels". The first permanent cinema house was founded by Viktor Ponrepo in 1907 in Prague. Sound was first used in Czechoslovakia in the film Když struny lkají (1930). Then the Czech movie industry experienced a boom period which lasted until WW2. Barrandov Studios were launched in 1933, it is the largest film studio in the country and one of the largest in Europe. At present the studios are often called the "European Hollywood" or "Hollywood of the East" due to increasing interest of western productions.
Famous movies of the 50s include: Journey to the Beginning of Time, The Good Soldier Švejk, The Emperor and the Golem, The Princess with the Golden Star, The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Proud Princess and Once Upon a Time, There Was a King....
Three Czech/Czechoslovak movies that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film were  The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze) by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos in 1965, Closely Watched Trains (Ostře sledované vlaky) by Jiří Menzel in 1967 and Kolya (Kolja) by Jan Svěrák in 1996. Several others were nominated.
The Czechoslovak New Wave, the golden age of Czech cinema, is most frequently associated with the early works of directors such as Miloš Forman, Věra Chytilová, Jiří Menzel and others, although works by older, more established Czechoslovak directors such as Karel Kachyňa and Vojtěch Jasný are also placed in this category. Encompassing a broad range of fresh and original works in the early to mid-1960s, the Czechoslovak New Wave cannot be pinned down to any one style or approach to filmmaking. Examples range from highly stylised, even avant-garde, literary adaptions using historical themes (e.g. Jan Němec's Diamonds of the Night (Démanty noci)) to semi-improvised comedies with contemporary subjects and amateur actors (e.g., Miloš Forman's The Firemen's Ball (Hoří, má panenko)). However, a frequent feature of films from this period were their absurd, black humour and an interest in the concerns of ordinary people, particularly when faced with larger historical or political changes. The acid western comedy film Lemonade Joe was a famous parody of old-time westerns. Cinematic influences included Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, although the Czechoslovak New Wave also builds organically on developments in Czechoslovak cinema in the late 1950s when directors broke free from the influence of Stalinism in the film industry. 
The most visited Czech film ever is Proud Princess from 1952. It was visited by 8,222,695 people. The film  also won a prize for a child film at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.http://www.csfd.cz/film/10094-pysna-princezna/zajimavosti/http://www.zeroku.com/html/zajimave-clanky/66-nejnavtvovanji-esky-film.html
Among the most successful Czech films after Velvet Revolution include: Kolya, Divided We Fall, Cosy Dens, Loners, I Served the King of England, Shut Up and Shoot Me and Walking Too Fast.

George Murphy "Pops" Foster (May 19, 1892 – October 29, 1969) was a jazz musician best known for his vigorous slap bass playing of the string bass. He also played the tuba and trumpet professionally.
Foster was born to Charley and Annie Foster, who "was nearly fullblooded Cherokee,"The Autobiography of Pops Foster: New Orleans Jazzman, as Told to Tom Stoddard By Pops Foster, Ross Russell. 2005. Backbeat Books. pg 5. ISBN 0-87930-831-1  on a plantation near McCall in Ascension Parish near Baton Rouge in south Louisiana. His family moved to New Orleans when he was about ten years of age. His older brother, Willard Foster, began playing banjo and guitar; George started out on a cello then switched to string bass. Foster married twice: to Bertha Foster in 1912 and Alma Foster in 1936.
Pops Foster was playing professionally by 1907 and worked with Jack Carey, Kid Ory, Armand Piron, King Oliver and other prominent hot bands of the era.
In 1921 he moved to St. Louis to play with the Charlie Creath and Dewey Jackson bands, in which he would be active  for much of the decade. He also joined Ory in Los Angeles. He acquired the nickname "Pops" because he was far older than any of the other players in the band.
In 1929 Foster moved to New York City, where he played with the bands of Luis Russell and Louis Armstrong through 1940. He gigged with various New York-based bands through the 1940s, including those of Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, and regular broadcasts on the national This Is Jazz radio program. He also recorded for the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet (Sidney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, Fitz Weston, and Kaiser Marshallhttp://books.google.es/books?id=fvUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA21&dq=Joe+Marshall+drums&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e0aBUdXnA62I7Aau-oCAAg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjhQ#v=onepage&q=Joe%20Marshall%20drums&f=false Billboard at Google Books.

Continuum International Publishing Group Jimmy Blythe, Jr., Danny Barker and Sid Catlett, and on the second session with Pleasant Joe on vocals).
In the late 1940s he began touring more widely and played in many countries in Europe, especially in France, and throughout the United States including returns to New Orleans and California.
In 1952, Foster toured Europe with Jimmy Archey's Band. He played regularly at Central Plaza in New York and briefly in New Orleans with Papa Celestin in 1954.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he played with Earl Hines' Small Band. In 1966, he toured Europe with the New Orleans All-Stars but remained based in San Francisco, where he died.
The Autobiography of Pops Foster was published in 1971, with a new edition in 2005 ISBN 0-87930-831-1 (alk. paper). Foster is quoted, "Some of the books are fouled up on" the times in New Orleans"..."and some of the guys weren't telling the truth." "The citics and guys who write about jazz think they know more about what went on on New Orleans that the guys that were there."

Earl Kenneth Hines, universally known as Earl "Fatha"Controversy persists over the origins of the name "Fatha". The most common account is that a radio announcer (some say Ted Pearson), possibly after Hines had accused him of being drunk, announced, slurringly, "Here comes 'Fatha' Hines thru the deep forest with his children", "Deep Forest" being the band's signature tune (Cooke, R., ''Jazz Encyclopedia'', ISBN 978-0-14-102646-6). Others have suggested it was because Hines had "… given birth to a style - more than a style, a virtual language - of jazz piano". Epstein, D.

An alvar is a biological environment based on a limestone plain with thin or no soil and, as a result, sparse grassland vegetation. Often flooded in the spring, and affected by drought in midsummer, alvars support a distinctive group of prairie-like plants.[tpl]cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Plants and Vegetation|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-86480-0|pages=666|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item5708831/?site_locale=en_GB[/tpl]  Most alvars occur either in northern EuropePetterson, B. 1965. Gotland and O¨ land: two limestone islands compared. Acta Phytogeographic Suecica 50: 131–140. or around the Great Lakes in North America.Catling, P. M. and V. R. Brownell. 1995. A review of the alvars of the Great Lakes region: distribution, floristic composition, biogeography and protection. The Canadian Field-Naturalist 109: 143–171.  This stressed habitat supports a community of rare plants and animals, including species more commonly found on prairie grasslands. Lichen and mosses are common species. Trees and bushes are absent or severely stunted. 
The primary cause of alvars is the shallow exposed bedrock. Flooding and drought, as noted, add to the stress of the site and prevent many species from growing.  Disturbance may also play a role.  In Europe, grazing is frequent, while in North America, there is some evidence that fire may also prevent encroachment by forest.Catling, P. M. and V.R. Brownell. 1998. Importance of fire in alvar ecosystems – evidence from the Burnt Lands, Eastern Ontario. The Canadian Field- Naturalist 112: 661–667.  The habitat also has strong competition gradients, with better competitors occupying the deeper soil and excluding other species to less productive locations.Belcher, J. W., P. A. Keddy, and L. Twolan-Strutt. 1995. Root and shoot competition intensity along a soil depth gradient. Journal of Ecology 83: 673–682. Crevices in the limestone provide a distinctive habitat which is somewhat protected from grazing, and which may provide habitat for unusual ferns such as Pellaea atropurpurea. Bare rock flats provide areas with extremely low competition that serve as refugia for weak competitors such as Minuartia michauxii and Micranthes virginiensis.  In a representative set of four Ontario alvars, seven habitat types were described.  From deep to shallow soil these were: tall grassy meadows, tall forb-rich meadows, low grassy meadows, low forb-rich meadows, dry grassland, rock margin grassland and bare rock flats.Belcher, J., P.A. Keddy and P.F.C. Catling. 1992. Alvar vegetation in Canada: a multivariate description at two scales. Canadian Journal of Botany 70: 1279-1291. 
Alvars comprise a small percentage of the Earth's ecosystems by land extent. Although some 120 exist in the Great Lakes region, in total there are only about [tpl]convert|112|km2[/tpl] left across the entire Great Lakes basin, and many of these have been degraded by agriculture and other human uses. More than half of all remaining alvars occur in Ontario.  There are smaller areas in New York, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Quebec.Reschke, Carol, Ron Reid, Judith Jones, Tom Feeney, and Heather Potter. 1999. Conserving Great Lakes Alvars. Final Technical Report of the International Alvar Conservation Initiative. Alvar Working Group,The Nature Conservancy, Chicago, IL.
In North America, alvars provide habitat for birds such as Bobolinks, Eastern Meadowlarks, Upland Sandpipers, Eastern Towhees, Brown Thrashers and Loggerhead Shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere. Rare plants include Kalm's lobelia (Lobelia kalmii), Pringle's aster, Juniper sedge (Carex juniperorum), Lakeside daisy (Hymenoxys acaulis), Ram's-head Lady's-slipper (Cypripedium arietinum) and Dwarf Lake Iris (Iris lacustris). Also associated with alvars are rare butterflies and snails.Catling, P.M. and Brownell, V.R. 1999. Alvars of the Great Lakes Region. p. 375-391, in R. C. Anderson, J. S. Fralish, and J. M. Baskin (eds.) Savannas, Barrens and Rock Outcrop Communities of North America. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
The use of the word "alvar" to refer to this type of environment originated in Scandinavia. The largest alvar in Europe is located on the Swedish island of Öland.  Here the thin soil mantle is only 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters thick in most places and in many extents consists of exposed limestone slabs.C.M. Hogan, The Stora Alvaret on Öland, Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca. July 21, 2006The countryside of eastern Smaland, ed. by Markus Forslund, Kalmarsund, Tryck (1999) ISBN 91-630-7610-1  The landscape there has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are other more local names for similar landforms, such as a pavement barren although this term is also used for similar landforms based on sandstone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art11877.html|title=Gadway sandstone pavement barrens|last=Anon|work=The nature Conservancy|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=24 April 2010|location=USA[/tpl] In the United Kingdom the exposed landform is called a limestone pavement and thinly covered limestone is known as calcareous grassland.

[[Zilpah]]

CATEGORIES: Torah people, Jacob, Burials in Tiberias, Concubines, Women in the Bible

In the Book of Genesis, Zilpah (זִלְפָּה "drooping", Standard Hebrew Zilpa, Tiberian Hebrew Zilpâ) is Leah's handmaid who becomes a wife of Jacob and bears him two sons Gad and Asher.[tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|30:9|HE[/tpl]
Zilpah is given to Leah as a handmaid by Leah's father, Laban, upon Leah's marriage to Jacob (see Genesis 29:24, 46:18). According to some commentators, Zilpah and Bilhah, the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, respectively, were actually younger daughters of Laban {Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, xxxvi.}.
According to Rashi, an 11th-century commentator, Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, and Laban's decision to give her to Leah was part of the deception he used to trick Jacob into marrying Leah, who was older than Rachel. The morning after the wedding, Laban explained to Jacob, "This is not done in our place, to give the younger before the older" ([tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|29:26|HE[/tpl]). But at night, to mask the deception, Laban gave the veiled bride the younger of the handmaids, so Jacob would think that he was really marrying Rachel, the younger of the sisters.
Zilpah also figures in the competition between Jacob's wives to bear him sons. Leah stops conceiving after the birth of her fourth son, at which point [tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|30:3|HE[/tpl] Rachel, who had not yet borne children, offers her handmaid, Bilhah, in marriage to Jacob so that she can have children through her. When Bilhah conceives two sons, Leah takes up the same idea and presents Zilpah as a wife to Jacob. Leah names the two sons of Zilpah and is directly involved in their upbringing.
In Jewish tradition, Zilpah is believed to be buried in the Tomb of the Matriarchs in Tiberias.

[[Independent Baptist Fellowship International]]

CATEGORIES: Religious organizations established in 1984, Fundamentalist denominations, Baptist denominations in North America, Baptist denominations established in the 20th century, 1984 establishments in Texas

[tpl]Baptist[/tpl]The Independent Baptist Fellowship International, or I.B.F.I., was formed on May 10, 1984, at Fort Worth, Texas, as a fellowship of independent, fundamentalist Baptist churches.Raymond W. Barber "A Brief History of the IBFI" Its founding resulted from a controversy involving Arlington Baptist College of Arlington, Texas, an affiliate of the World Baptist Fellowship, after Raymond W. Barber, then President of the W.B.F., lost a lawsuit against the college.Earl K. Oldham, "USS WBF Sail On"  The lawsuit was an attempt to force the Arlington Baptist College to recognize its parent/child relationship to the W.B.F., revert to its original name, Bible Baptist Seminary, and return to the original intent of its founders, J. Frank Norris and Louis Entzminger.  He claimed that by seeking accreditation, the Arlington Baptist College was straying from its original purpose of training preachers.  Barber moved forward with the lawsuit even though an investigator found that the Bible Baptist Seminary Board of Directors had created a new junior college in conjunction with the seminary, the seminary was allowed to die and the Arlington Baptist Junior College actually became the Arlington Baptist College.
Although it was not a major issue during the controversy, Barber charged the Arlington Baptist College with teaching the doctrines of grace, often called Calvinism, and said that some of its faculty members were "hyper" Calvinists.Earl K. Oldham, "USS WBF Sail On"  It was a strategy that worked, bringing together a strong following who shared his concerns.  Barber's actions resulted in his becoming a catalyst that drew 271 disenchanted pastors and missionaries together to create the new organization.
I.B.F.I. was careful to incorporate all of its institutions into one unit.  It created a Bible institute, Norris Bible Baptist Institute, a monthly publication, The Searchlight, and a mission agency, all of which were under one corporation and headed by a board of directors.  It elected Raymond Barber, Randy Cotton, Arvie Jernigan, Bill Slayton and Jack Warren as its first board of directors.Raymond W. Barber "A Brief History of the IBFI"  The early years were aggressive, drawing support from 327 churches for its school, publication and 21 missionary families.Raymond W. Barber "A Brief History of the IBFI"
After a few years of tremendous momentum, the organization began to have internal squabbles.  Barber was elected to the office of the president year after year without any challenge whatsoever.  Finally, someone stood up in a meeting and nominated another pastor to that office.  In a ruse, fifteen minutes before his term expired, Barber resigned.  Again, his strategy worked.  He was reelected by a landslide vote.  But that incident proved to be a foreshadow of things to come.  In "A View of the Norris Phenomenon",Jack Warren "A View of the Norris Phenomenon" the author points to the common problem of egocentricity among fundamentalist leaders as the cause of I.B.F.I.'s decline. In less than seven years, Barber had badgered Jack Warren, editor of The Searchlight, and Young Houston, director of missions, into resigning.
Most of the original pastors soon left I.B.F.I. for various reasons.  A new group of ministers, who were mostly anti-organizational, came into the ranks.  The Bible institute became a seminary, the mission agency was reduced to a clearing house and the by-laws were replaced by a document that disenfranchised the supporting churches.  Financial problems began to plague the organization and enrollment in the seminary consistently lagged between 10 and 25 students.  A deal was eventually made for Crown College in Knoxville, Tennessee, to take over the seminary. Critics blame the questionable funding of an expensive building on I.B.F.I. property, called the "Raymond Barber Conference Center", for the fellowship's ultimate failure.Albert W. Wardin, Jr. "Baptists Around the World"
In its prime, Arlington Baptist College had a consistently expanding enrollment that was close to 1,000 students.Earl K. Oldham "USS WBF Sail On"  Twenty-five years after the split, total enrollment for both schools was under 200 students annually.  Today, many independent Baptist leaders, even former supporters of the fellowship, believe that the demise of the IBFI is imminent.

[[Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture]]
CATEGORIES: Graph theory, Conjectures, Paul Erdős

In graph theory, the unproven Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture, made in 1995 by the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős and his collaborator András Gyárfás, states that every graph with minimum degree 3 contains a simple cycle whose length is a power of two. Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many conjectures of Erdős.
If the conjecture is false, a counterexample would take the form of a graph with minimum degree three having no power-of-two cycles. It is known through computer searches of Gordon Royle and Klas Markström that any counterexample must have at least 17 vertices, and any cubic counterexample must have at least 30 vertices. Markström's searches found four graphs on 24 vertices in which the only power-of-two cycles have 16 vertices. One of these four graphs is planar; however, the Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture is now known to be true for the special case of cubic planar graphs [tpl]harv| Heckman|Krakovski|2013[/tpl]
Weaker results relating the degree of a graph to unavoidable sets of cycle lengths are known: there is a set S of lengths, with |S| = O(n0.99), such that every graph with average degree ten or more contains a cycle with its length in S [tpl]harv|Verstraëte|2005[/tpl], and every graph whose average degree is exponential in the iterated logarithm of n necessarily contains a cycle whose length is a power of two [tpl]harv|Sudakov|Verstraëte|2008[/tpl]. The conjecture is also known to be true for planar claw-free graphs [tpl]harv|Daniel|Shauger|2001[/tpl] and for graphs that avoid large induced stars and satisfy additional constraints on their degrees [tpl]harv|Shauger|1998[/tpl].

Eight known filarial nematodes use humans as their definitive hosts. These are divided into three groups according to the niche within the body they occupy: 
The adult worms, which usually stay in one tissue, release early larval forms known as microfilariae into the host's bloodstream. These circulating microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host.
Individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either "microfilaraemic" or "amicrofilaraemic", depending on whether or not microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood. Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Occult filariasis is diagnosed in amicrofilaraemic cases based on clinical observations and, in some cases, by finding a circulating antigen in the blood.

[[Ankle]]

CATEGORIES: Foot, Joints, Lower limb anatomy

The ankle, or the talocrural region, is the region where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the Inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, "ankle" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint.
The main bones of the ankle region are the talus (in the foot), and the  tibia and fibula (in the leg). The talus is also called the ankle bone. The talocrural joint is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus.[tpl]EMedicineDictionary|Ankle+joint[/tpl] The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than that between the smaller fibula and the talus.

"Plan Colombia" is a term used to refer to all U.S. support and legislation aimed at combating Colombian Drug cartels and left-wing insurgency groups in Colombian territory .
Plan Colombia can also refer to a wider aid initiative originally proposed by Colombian President Andrés Pastrana Arango, which included U.S. military/counter-narcotics aid, but was not limited to it. The plan was conceived between 1998 and 1999 by the administration of Pastrana with the goals of ending the Colombian armed conflict and creating an anti-cocaine strategy.
Critics of the initiative also claimed that elements within the Colombian security forces, which received aid and training from the U.S., were involved in supporting or tolerating abuses by right-wing paramilitary forces against left-wing guerrilla organizations and their sympathizers. Another controversial element of the anti-narcotic strategy is aerial fumigation to eradicate coca. This activity has come under fire because it damages legal crops and has adverse health effects upon those exposed to the herbicides.

[[Function approximation]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical models, Statistical approximations

The need for function approximations arises in many branches of applied mathematics, and computer science in particular.  In general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a function among a well-defined class that closely matches ("approximates") a target function in a task-specific way.
One can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions approximation theory  is the branch of numerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for example, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).
Second, the target function, call it g, may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points of the form (x, g(x)) is provided.  Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain of g, several techniques for approximating g may be applicable.  For example, if g is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of interpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can be used.  If the codomain (range or target set) of g is a finite set, one is dealing with a classification problem instead.
To some extent the different problems (regression, classification, fitness approximation) have received a unified treatment in statistical learning theory, where they are viewed as supervised learning problems.

CATEGORIES: The West Wing characters, Fictional Presidents of the United States, Fictional Democrats (United States), Fictional state governors of the United States, Fictional members of the United States House of Representatives, Fictional characters from New Hampshire, Fictional characters introduced in 1999

Josiah Edward "Jed" Bartlet, PhD., D.Hum.Litt, is a fictional character from the television serial drama The West Wing, portrayed by Martin Sheen. The role earned Sheen a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2001, as well as two SAG Awards. Bartlet's tenure as a Democratic President of the United States is a preeminent aspect of the series. His origin as a recurring character evolved due to Sheen's acting finesse; creator Aaron Sorkin and fellow West Wing writers shaped Bartlet's position within the show accordingly. The first season depicts his second year in office and subsequent seasons flesh out the details of his administration, including friction between his policies and those of the Republican-dominated Congress, his tribulations with multiple sclerosis, his reelection, and the campaign of his successor. Characterized by manifest integrity, quick witticisms, a fierce intellect, and compassionate stoicism, Bartlet is widely acclaimed by critics and political commentators alike as the "most popular Democratic president in recent memory."[tpl]cite book|last1=Van Belle|first1=Douglas A.|last2=Mash|first2=Kenneth M.|title=A Novel Approach to Politics|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2007|isbn=1-56802-829-6|oclc=71350326[/tpl]

The fireside chats were a series of thirty evening radio addresses given by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1944. Although the World War I Committee on Public Information had seen presidential policy propagated to the public en masse, "fireside chats" were the first media development that facilitated intimate and direct communication between the president and the citizens of the United States. Roosevelt's cheery voice and demeanor played him into the favor of citizens and he soon became one of the most popular presidents ever, often affectionately compared to Abraham Lincoln.Eric Foner, Give Me Liberty! An American History, page 759. On radio, he was able to quell rumors and explain his reasons for social change slowly and comprehensibly.Lumeng (Jenny) Yu. The Great Communicator: How Roosevelt's Radio Speeches Shaped American History, pp. 89-106.  Radio was especially convenient for Roosevelt because it enabled him to hide his polio symptoms from the public eye.

The first political and military leader in Egypt to rise from the fellahin, ‘Urabi participated in a 1879 mutiny that developed into a general revolt against the Anglo-French dominated administration of Khedive Tewfik. He was promoted to Tewfik's cabinet and began reforms of Egypt's military and civil administrations, but a massacre of foreign and native Christians in Alexandria in 1882 prompted a British bombardment and invasion that deposed ‘Urabi and his allies in favor of a British occupation.

[[M50 motorway (Ireland)]]

CATEGORIES: Motorways in the Republic of Ireland, Roads in County Dublin, Ring roads

The M50 motorway ([tpl]lang-ga|Mótarbhealach M50[/tpl]) is a motorway in Ireland running in a C-shaped ring around the north-eastern, northern, western and southern sides of the capital city, Dublin. The northern end of the route is located at the entrance to the Dublin Port Tunnel. Anti-clockwise it heads northwest through the tunnel and then veers west at a junction with the M1 motorway. It crosses the dual West-Link toll bridges over the River Liffey in west Dublin, and forms a loop around the south-east of Dublin to meet the M11 route (running south to Wexford) at Shankill, County Dublin. Between Junctions 3 to 13 the road forms part of European route E01.
The M50 was first proposed in the Dublin Transportation Study of 1971. Construction began on the first part of the M50, the Western Parkway, in 1987. This section of the M50, between Junctions 6 (Blanchardstown) and 11 (Tallaght), opened to traffic in 1990. This was followed in 1996 by the Northern Cross section between Junctions 6 and 3 and the Southern Cross between Junctions 11 and 13 which opened in 2001. The completed M50 motorway was formally opened on 30 June 2005, and later the Dublin Port Tunnel, which was opened on 20 December 2006, was included as part of the route.
Work commenced in early 2006 on upgrading earlier sections of motorway. Many of the grade-separated signal-controlled roundabout interchanges were replaced with free-flowing junctions and the road from the M1 junction to Sandyford was widened to three lanes in each direction with a fourth auxiliary lane provided between junctions.
On Sunday 7th Feb 2010, the M50 Southern Cross was opened up to 3 lanes in each direction from J10 Ballymount to J14 Sandyford. This followed a week after the Northern Cross opened from J3 M1 to J6 N3. The M50 is now 3 lanes in each direction from J3 M1 to J14 Sandyford, with auxiliary lanes between all junctions from the M1 to Firhouse

Spümcø, Inc., a.k.a. Spumco, was an American animation production company based in Los Angeles, California. The studio produced three traditionally animated series, two Flash-animated cartoon series, two music videos, five animated shorts, and a comic book. The company also went on to produce content for a few animated spots and commercials.Aditham, Kiran (2007 December 3). "John K. Joins Hoytyboy". Hoytyboy Pictures. Retrieved on 27 March 2010.

A concept claimed to be "revived" by then-president of Nickelodeon, Geraldine Laybourne, was that of "creator-driven cartoons". Spümcø co-founder and then-president John Kricfalusi sold The Ren & Stimpy Show to Nickelodeon in 1988, which became Spümcø's first original animated series production. The  Golden Age of American animation, like the 1940s cartoons by Bob Clampett and Tex Avery to name a few, served for inspiration for the bizarre expressions and artwork for which Spümcø became well-known.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/574/000044442/ |title=John Kricfalusi profile |accessdate=27 March 2010 |publisher=Notable Names Database[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Kanfer, Stefan|title=Loonier Toon Tales|work=Time Magazine|date=1992-04-13|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975286,00.html|accessdate=27 March 2010[/tpl]

Relayer is the seventh studio album from the English progressive rock band Yes, released in 1974 on Atlantic Records. It is their only studio album recorded with keyboardist Patrick Moraz; he joined in August that year after Rick Wakeman left over differences with Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) to pursue his solo career. Formed of three tracks, Relayer saw Yes experiment with jazz fusion as highlighted in "The Gates of Delirium" and "Sound Chaser". The album closes with "To Be Over", a melodic composition.
Upon its release Relayer continued the band's commercial success. The album peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 5 on the US Billboard Top LPs chart. The closing section of "The Gates Delirium", titled "Soon", was released as a single in January 1975. The album is certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Her father, Harry Ockelman, Jr., is listed as unmarried in the 1920 U.S. Census of Pennsylvania. – July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage and television actress.
Lake won both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her role in Sullivan's Travels and for her femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. By the late 1940s however, Lake's career had begun to decline in part due to her struggles with mental illness and alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several guest-starring roles on   television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film Footsteps In the Snow, but the role failed to revitalize her career.
Lake released her memoirs, Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake, in 1970. She used the money she made from the book to finance a low-budget horror film Flesh Feast. It was her final onscreen role. Lake died in July 1973 from hepatitis and acute kidney injury at the age of 50.

Fulgence Charpentier, OC (June 29, 1897 – February 6, 2001) was a French-Canadian journalist, editor and publisher.
Born in Sainte-Anne-de-Prescott, Ontario, Charpentier's career included diplomatic, political and bureaucratic positions, but his first love had been journalism ever since he began his reporting career at Montreal's Le Devoir in 1915, during which he earned $20 a week.
In 1918, Charpentier joined the Canadian army, but the war ended before he could be sent overseas. He stayed in the army after the Armistice to work in a military hospital on the campus of McGill University in Montreal.
Charpentier began covering Parliament for Ottawa's Le Droit (the city's largest newspaper) in 1922. He got the job because his father built Le Droit's first offices. The newspaper sent him to law school in Toronto for two academic years before he began his parliamentary reporting.100-year-old journalist still writes weekly column. Mark Bourrie, Toronto Star, March 28, 1998, E1.
Charpentier was the longest-serving member of the Parliamentary Press Gallery. His early stories on the then-unilingual English environment of Parliament were believed to be instrumental in getting federal authorities to increase the visibility of French in the Canadian public service. Over the course of his career, Charpentier also wrote for Montreal's La Presse and Quebec's Le Soleil.
He was also head of the French section of the Canadian Censorship Branch through most of the Second World War, assuming full control of the Censorship Branch in January 1945, when chief censor Wilfrid Eggleston resigned. He was appointed editor-in-chief of Le Droit following his diplomatic career in 1968 at the age of 71.
His resume included serving as a media spokesman for ambassador Georges Vanier in Paris and working as a diplomatForeign Affairs and International Trade Canada Complete List of Posts from 1946 until 1968 in some francophone African nations and South America. While serving in Africa, Charpentier met Dr. Albert Schweitzer and became an advocate for his work.
Charpentier was still writing weekly columns on his trusty typewriter for Le Droit until 1999, when he had to stop due to chronic bronchial pneumonia at the age of 101. The Canadian Parliamentary Press gallery held a celebration for him shortly after Charpentier's retirement.
In 1978, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1998.
He died at age 103 of pneumonia on February 6, 2001.
Charpentier served on the Ottawa Board of Control, and ran for mayor in 1935, but lost.

[[Maya dance]]

CATEGORIES: Maya society, Mesoamerican art, Ritual dances, Maya art

In pre-Columbian Maya civilization, Ceremonial dance had great importance. However, since dance is a transient art, it is inherently difficult for archeologists to find and evaluate evidence of its role. There is little material information left behind, beyond a few paintings on murals and vases. This poverty of facts causes a wide range of interpretations by different archeologists. 
Dance was a central component of social, religious, and political endeavours for the ancient Maya. The entire community danced, including kings, nobles, and common people. Dance served many functions such as creating sacred space, closing the gap between here and the otherworld, and releasing the dead from the grasp of the Xibalbans (see Xibalba).

[[Candidate key]]

CATEGORIES: Data modeling

In the relational model of databases, a candidate key of a relation is a minimal superkey for that relation; that is, a set of attributes such that
The constituent attributes are called prime attributes.  Conversely, an attribute that does not occur in ANY candidate key is called a non-prime attribute.
Since a relation contains no duplicate tuples, the set of all its attributes is a superkey if NULL values are not used. It follows that every relation will have at least one candidate key.
The candidate keys of a relation tell us all the possible ways we can identify its tuples. As such they are an important concept for the design of database schema.

The A6 is one of the main historic north south roads in England.  It currently runs from Luton in Bedfordshire to Carlisle in Cumbria, although it formerly started at a junction with the A1 at Barnet.
Running north west from Luton, the road travels through Bedford, bypasses Rushden, Kettering and Market Harborough, continues through Leicester, Loughborough, Derby and Matlock before going through the Peak District to Bakewell, Buxton, Stockport, Manchester, Salford, Pendleton, Irlams o' th' Height, Pendlebury, Swinton, Walkden, Little Hulton, Bolton, Chorley, Preston, Lancaster, Kendal and Penrith before reaching Carlisle.
South of Derby, the road is paralleled by the M1 motorway, and north of Manchester the M6 and M61 motorways approximate its course. Between Derby and Manchester the A6 follows a completely different routing to the motorway network, crossing the Peak District rather than going around it. Because of these duplications, the A6 is less important than formerly.

[[Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures]]

CATEGORIES: Mesoamerican society, Mesoamerican mythology and religion, Mythological felines, Maya society, Olmec, Animals in mythology, World Digital Library related

The representation of jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures has a long history, with iconographic examples dating back to at least the mid-Formative period of Mesoamerican chronology. The jaguar (Panthera onca) is an animal with a prominent association and appearance in the cultures and belief systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies. Quick, agile, and powerful enough to take down the largest prey in the jungle, the jaguar is the largest of the big cats in the Americas, and one of the most efficient and aggressive predators.  Endowed with a spotted coat and well adapted for the jungle, hunting either in the trees or water, making it one of the few felines tolerant of water, the jaguar was, and remains, revered among the indigenous Americans who live closely with the jaguar.  
All major Mesoamerican civilizations prominently featured a jaguar god, and for many, such as the Olmec, the jaguar was an important part of shamanism.Miller & Taube, p. 103.

The Jaguar's secret identity is that of Linda Rivera, an East Los Angeles law student. Linda lives in an alternate timeline in which proposition 187 has transformed California in to a police state ruled by right-wing fundamendalist groups, which enact the removal of equal employment and affirmative action policies. People of color are consistently denied civil rights while racist hate groups are allowed to proliferate throughout the state. Tired of seeing her people persecuted, Rivera dons the mantle of Cihualyaomiquiz, a term from the Aztec language translated as "Woman ready to die in battle" and becomes a vigilante known as The Jaguar. She is assisted by local activists groups and makes use of her fighting ability, detective skills and knowledge of the law in her pursuit of social justice.

The Tobacco Protest, was a Shi'a cleric-led revolt in Iran against an 1890 tobacco concession granted by the Shah to Great Britain. The protest climaxed in a widely-obeyed December 1891 fatwa against tobacco use supposedly issued by Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi.
Beginning in the 19th century, the Qajar dynasty found itself in a precarious situation due to an increasing foreign presence within Iran.  Reeling from devastating losses against the Russian Empire in 1813 and 1828 as well as the British Empire in 1857, not only was the Qajar government forced to grant countless concessions to these foreign powers, but Iranian bazaaris (merchants) were left in a highly vulnerable position as they couldn’t compete with the numerous economic advantages gained by merchants from Europe.Moaddel, Mansoor. “Shi'i Political Discourse and Class Mobilization in the Tobacco Movement of 1890-1892.” Sociological Forum, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Sep., 1992): p. 455.  According to the accounts of foreigners living in Iran at the time, the Qajar dynasty was highly unpopular among the populace and was perceived as having little concern for the welfare of its residents.  Later accounts by British eyewitnesses suggest that the reason why the dynasty had not been overthrown sooner in the face of widespread discontent was due to British and Russian intervention that essentially propped up the shah.Keddie, Nikki. Religion and Rebellion in Iran: The Tobacco Protest of 1891-92. Frank Cass, 1966, p. 3.
In 1872, Nasir al-Din Shah negotiated a concession with Baron Julius de Reuter, a British citizen, granting him control over Persian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for 5 years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years.  The Reuter concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests but the Russian government was also hostile towards the concession as well.Keddie, p. 5.  Under immense pressure, Nasir al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation.  While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the entire debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers, in this case the Russian government, who had their own interests in the region.Lambton, Ann.

Dryden, a prominent aeronautical engineer who at the time of his death in 1965 was NASA's deputy administrator, and it is still variously known as Dryden or the Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) while the details of the name change are decided. First known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Muroc Flight Test Unit, the DFRC has also been known as the High-Speed Flight Research Station (1949) and the High-Speed Flight Station (1954). The facility was renamed, effective March 1, 2014, the Neil A.

Until 2004, Armstrong Flight Research Center operated the oldest B-52 Stratofortress bomber, a B-52B model (tail number 008) which had been converted to drop test aircraft, dubbed 'Balls 8.'  It dropped a large number of supersonic test vehicles, ranging from the X-15 to its last research program, the hypersonic X-43A, powered by a Pegasus rocket.  The aircraft was retired and will eventually find a permanent home at the North Gate of Edwards; a fitting location for an aircraft that was arguably the greatest contributor to aerospace and flight test development.

CATEGORIES: Bebop guitarists, American academics, American jazz guitarists, Berklee College of Music alumni, Berklee College of Music faculty, 1954 births, Living people, Brookline, Massachusetts

Stephen Rochinski (born 20 January 1954) is a self-taught bebop jazz guitarist and educator.
He has worked and performed with Tal Farlow, Attila Zoller, Jimmy Raney, Pete and Conte Candoli, Tim Hagans, Joe Lovano, Greg Hopkins, Gary Foster, Pat Harbison, Jeff Sherman, Hal Melia, Chip Stephens, Hank Marr, Brad Goode, Joe Hunt, Scott Lee, Chuck Redd, Richard Evans, Bob Freedman, Tony Tillman, as well as numerous studio, concert, club date, and international clinic appearances.
As one of the scions of the legacy of Tal Farlow, Steve has received numerous grants and awards including a 1993 Jazz Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts for private study with Farlow. In 1984, upon leaving the road life as the music director, guitarist, and arranger for The Tony Tillman Show, he eventually became Professor at his alma mater, the world-renowned Berklee College of Music (Magna Cum Laude) where, in addition to curriculum development and consulting, he teaches all levels of harmony. Steve is the author of Harmony 4, the last in a series of the Core harmony curriculum text books. He also teaches arranging, ear training, ensembles, and improvisation labs. Steve is also the author of the award winning "The Jazz Style of Tal Farlow: The Elements of Bebop Guitar" and "The Motivic Basis for Jazz Guitar Improvisation" (Hal Leonard Corp.) Both Rochinski and his book contributed to the reintroduction of Tal Farlow to the jazz guitar community, where Farlow remained a major figure until his death in July 1998.
When Rochinski returned to Boston and Berklee in 1984, Tim Hagans and he met and formed a short-lived, but important electric quintet called "Digital Hands". It was during this time that Hagans,in collaboration and a shared artistic vision with Rochinski, planted the early seeds for what was to become one of Hagans' most controversial and groundbreaking projects, his "Animation-Imagination" album recorded for Blue Note Records in 1999.
One of the highlights of Steve's performance career was his selection as one of a handful of guitarists to perform at the 1996 JVC Jazz Festival 75th birthday tribute concert for Tal Farlow at Merkin Hall in New York City. Steve teamed up with Atilla Zoller and Andre Ryabov to perform Zoller's "Homage to O.P." (Blues Grotesque). Other guitarists who appeared at this historic concert event were Johnny Smith, Howard Alden, Herb Ellis, John Abercrombie, Gene Bertoncini, and Sal Salvador among others.
In 1995, Steve released his debut CD “Until Further Notice…” in collaboration with Grammy-winning producer Richard Evans. (LineOut Music/Northcountry Dist.) He currently records for Jardis Records, Germany’s leading jazz guitar label. His releases also include “A Bird In The Hand” (JRCD9922), “Otherwise” (JRCD20033), and "Jazz Guitar Highlights Vol.1" (JRCD20141) (www.jardis.de). Steve’s books and recordings continue to generate international sales and his music has been featured on prominent jazz radio programs throughout the world, as well as productions for Showtime and Hallmark.
At Berklee, Steve instructs an international student body in all aspects of contemporary jazz and popular harmonic practice, including Reharmonization Techniques, Advanced Harmonic Concepts, and Advanced Modal Harmony, which are considered the heart of Berklee's legendary harmony curriculum. In January of 2014, he was honored with Berklee's Distinguished Professor Award. In November 2001, Steve’s life and career was featured in the 7th Anniversary issue of the magazine for jazz guitar fans, "Just Jazz Guitar" (No.29;November 2001)). Steve is due to be profiled in the 5th edition of "The Jazz Guitar: Its Evolution, Players, And Personalities Since 1900 by Maurice Summerfield (Ashley Mark Publishing)) In 2005, Steve's bio was chosen for inclusion in Who’s Who In America (Marquis Publishing)). He remains active as a performer, composer, and clinician.
His daughter Anna is a member of the Boston-base psych folk trio Quilt.http://www.thegirlsare.com/2014/02/19/interview-anna-fox-rochinski/ Cheri Amour, 'Interview - Anna Fox Rochinski' The Girls Are Magazine, February 19, 2014.

The Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany ([tpl]lang-de|Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands[/tpl], DBD) was an East German political party.  The DBD was founded in 1948. It had 52 representatives in the Volkskammer, as part of the National Front. The DBD participated in all GDR cabinets (with exception of the last GDR cabinet). According to Deutsche Bauernpartei from chronik der wende the founding of the DBD was an attempt by the SED to weaken the influence of CDU/LDPD in the rural community by establishing a party loyal to the SED. The leadership cadre came mainly from the ranks of the SED.[tpl]cn|date=October 2013[/tpl] In the late 1980s, the party had 117,000 members.Dirk Jurich, Staatssozialismus und gesellschaftliche Differenzierung: eine empirische Studie, p.31.

After the fall of Berlin Wall, the party initially tried to find itself a niche as ecological agrarian party, but the first free Volkskammer election (1990) netted it only nine seats. In 1990 the DBD merged with the Christian Democratic Union.

[[Shell (projectile)]]

A shell is a payload-carrying projectile which, as opposed to shot, contains an explosive or other filling, though modern usage sometimes includes[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] large solid projectiles properly termed shot (AP, APCR, APCNR, APDS, APFSDS and proof shot). Solid shot may contain a pyrotechnic compound if a tracer or spotting charge is used. Originally it was called a "bombshell", but "shell" has come to be unambiguous in a military context. "Bombshell" is still used figuratively to refer to a shockingly unexpected happening or revelation.
All explosive- and incendiary-filled projectiles, particularly for mortars, were originally called grenades, derived from the pomegranate, whose seeds are similar to grains of powder.  Words cognate with grenade are still used for an artillery or mortar projectile in some European languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=grenade&searchmode=none |title=Etymology of grenade |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=1972-01-08 |accessdate=2013-02-27[/tpl]
Shells are usually large-calibre projectiles fired by artillery and combat vehicles (including tanks), and warships.
Shells usually have the shape of a cylinder topped by an ogive-shaped nose for good aerodynamic performance, possibly with a tapering base; but some specialized types are quite different.

Lifemapper is building a species diversity map of the world.  It is similar to the SETI@Home client, in that it uses a distributed computing client running primarily on home user's computers to correlate georeferenced biological samples with environmental models of the Earth.  It is an experimental GIS, or Geographic Information System, that uses a special genetic algorithm to see if predicted rules about where a species lives match up with the species' observed natural settings.  It is hoped that this technique will be able to both represent a current "map" of all organisms habitats on Earth as well as predict where organisms may possibly thrive or face extinction due to climate change and other ecological transformations.

[[Vision Serpent]]

CATEGORIES: World-bearing animals, Maya mythology and religion, Maya legendary creatures, Mesoamerican legendary creatures, Latin American folklore, Legendary serpents

The Vision Serpent is an important creature in Pre-Columbian Maya mythology, although the term itself is now slowly becoming outdated.
The serpent was a very important social and religious symbol, revered by the Maya. Maya mythology describes serpents as being the vehicles by which celestial bodies, such as the sun and stars, cross the heavens. The shedding of their skin made them a symbol of rebirth and renewal.
They were so revered, that one of the main Mesoamerican deities, Quetzalcoatl, was represented as a feathered serpent. The name means "beautiful serpent" (From Nahuatl, 'Quetzalli' means beautiful and 'coatl' meaning snake or serpent.).Coe (1992, p.79)
The Vision Serpent is thought to be the most important of the Maya serpents. "It was usually bearded and had a rounded snout. It was also often depicted as having two heads or with the spirit of a god or ancestor emerging from its jaws." During Maya bloodletting rituals, participants would experience visions in which they communicated with the ancestors or gods. These visions took the form of a giant serpent "which served as a gateway to the spirit realm." The ancestor or god who was being contacted was depicted as emerging from the serpent’s mouth. The vision serpent thus came to be the method in which ancestors or Gods manifested themselves to the Maya. Thus for them, the Vision Serpent was a direct link between the spirit realm of the gods and the physical world.Schele & Freidel (1990, p.395)
The Vision Serpent goes back to earlier Maya conceptions, and lies at the
center of the world as they conceived it. "It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power."Schele & Freidel (1990, p.68)
The Vision Serpent is prevalent in bloodletting ceremonies, in Maya religious practices, Maya jewelry, pottery and their architecture.

Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. She was especially known in Britain for her unaccompanied recording of the Northumbrian folk tune Blow the Wind Southerly, which was played regularly on BBC Radio for many years after her death.
The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council the Encouragement of Music the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout England. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts.
In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.
Ferrier was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1951. In between periods of hospitalisation and convalescence she continued to perform and record; her final public appearance was as Orfeo, at the Royal Opera House in February 1953, eight months before her death. Among her many memorials, the Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund was launched in May 1954; the Kathleen Ferrier Scholarship Fund, administered by the Royal Philharmonic Society, has since 1956 made annual awards to aspiring young professional singers.

CATEGORIES: Types of sculpture, Figurines, Toy collecting

A figurine (a diminutive form of the word figure) is a statuette that represents a human, deity or animal. Figurines may be realistic or iconic, depending on the skill and intention of the creator. The earliest were made of stone or clay.  Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood and plastic.
Figures with movable parts, allowing limbs to be posed, are more likely to be called dolls, mannequins, or action figures; or robots or automata, if they can move on their own.
Figurines and miniatures are sometimes used in board games, such as chess, and tabletop role playing games. Old figurines have been used to discount some historical theories, such as the origins of chess.

[[Haimirich]]

CATEGORIES: Given names

Haimirich is an old Middle High German given name from which many modern names derive. Among them are names like Henry, Henri, Heinrich, Enrico, Enrique and their female counterparts. This name means 'ruler of the Home', from 'haim' (home) and 'rich' (powerful).
Some forms and alternates of this name:
Even the name America may well derive from this name, from Haimirich > Emericus > Americus > America. America is so named in honour of either Amerigo Vespucci (who referred to himself in writing as Americus Vespucius), who was one of the first to assert that America was a newly discovered continent or from Richard Amerike. Vespucci was named in honor of St. Emericus, or, in Hungarian, Szent Imre, son of the first king of Hungary, St. Stephen. Other theories are held by a small minority of historians. See The Americas.
Some of the above names, on the other hand, may be from Amaliricus or its roots (Amal and Eric), especially ones like Emeric, Amerigo, and Arrigo.
In Europe, many kings and noblemen of various countries had names derived from Haimirich. For examples, see List of British monarchs, List of French Monarchs, List of German Kings and Emperors, various other lists of medieval rulers, to be found at Lists of incumbents, and King Henry.

Proposition 54 would have amended the Constitution of California to prohibit the state government and local governments from using racial classifications in most of its business. Its official title was Racial Privacy Initiative. Supporters of the measure said it was the first step towards a "colorblind" society, while opponents felt that it would make it more difficult for the state to provide services and identify and correct racial disparities.

Rollout photography, a type of peripheral photography, is a process used to create a two-dimensional photographic image of a three-dimensional object.  This process is the photographic equivalent of a cylindrical map projection in cartography.  It is used predominantly for the projection of images of cylindrical objects such as vases or ceramic vessels.  The objective of this process is to present to the observer a planar representation of the object's characteristics, most notably the illustrations or artwork extant on the outside surfaces of such vessels. This planar representation is captured using photographic imaging techniques.Kerr, Justin. "A Short History of Rollout Photography". famsi.org. Retrieved 2011-04-16.

[[Cypselus]]

CATEGORIES: 627 BC deaths, Ancient Corinthians, Ancient Greek rulers, 7th-century BC Greek people, Archaic tyrants, Year of birth unknown

Cypselus (or Kypselos) (in Greek, [tpl]lang|grc|Κύψελος[/tpl]) was the first tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BCE.
With increased wealth and more complicated trade relations and social structures, Greek city-states tended to overthrow their traditional hereditary priest-kings; Corinth, the richest archaic polis, led the way.J. B. Salmon , Wealthy Corinth. A History of the City to 338 B.C. (Oxford: Clarendon Press) 1984. Like the signori of late medieval and Renaissance Italy, the tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support. Often the tyrants upheld existing laws and customs and were highly conservative as to cult practices, thus maintaining stability with little risk to their own personal security. As in Renaissance Italy, a cult of personality naturally substituted for the divine right of the former legitimate royal house. 
After the last traditional king of Corinth, Telestes, was assassinated by Arieus and Perantas, there were no more kings; instead prytanes taken from the former royal house of the Bacchiadae ruled for a single year each. Cypselus, the son of Eëtion and a disfigured woman named Labda, who was a member of the Bacchiad family, the ruling dynasty, usurped power, became tyrant and expelled the Bacchiadae.  
According to Herodotus the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of Eëtion would overthrow their dynasty, and they planned to kill the baby once it was born; however, Herodotus says that the newborn smiled at each of the men sent to kill it, and none of them could go through with the plan. An etiological myth-element, to account for the name Cypselus (cypsele (κυψἐλη) "chest") accounted how Labda then hid the baby in a chest, and when the men had composed themselves and returned to kill it, they could not find it. (Compare the infancy of Perseus.) The cedar chest of Cypselus, richly worked with mythological narratives and adorned with ivory and gold, was a votive offering at Olympia, where Pausanias gave it a minute description in his 2nd century AD travel guide.Pausanias, 5.18.7. 
When Cypselus had grown up, he fulfilled the prophecy. Corinth had been involved in wars with Argos and Corcyra, and the Corinthians were unhappy with their rulers. At the time, around 657 BCE, Cypselus was polemarch, the archon in charge of the military, and he used his influence with the soldiery to expel the Bacchiadae. He also expelled his other enemies, but allowed them to set up colonies in northwestern Greece. He also increased trade with the colonies in Italy and Sicily.
He ruled for thirty years and was succeeded as tyrant by his son Periander in 627 BCE. The treasury Cypselus built at Delphi was apparently still standing in the time of Herodotus.

CATEGORIES: Detonators, Nuclear weapon design

The exploding-bridgewire detonator (EBW, also known as exploding wire detonator) is a type of detonator used to initiate the detonation reaction in explosive materials, similar to a blasting cap in that it is fired using an electric current.  EBWs use a different physical mechanism than blasting caps, using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied.  This has led to their common use in nuclear weapons.
The slapper detonator is a more recent development along similar lines.

The town began as a small shipping community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and Dover. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and regular flooding that has prevented the town's redevelopment.

[[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)]]

CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy

In neuroanatomy, a nucleus is a brain structure consisting of a relatively compact cluster of neurons.  It is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell organization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or cerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of gray matter, often bordered by white matter.  The vertebrate brain contains hundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size.  A nucleus may itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons arranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers.
The term "nucleus" is in some cases used rather loosely, to mean simply an identifiably distinct group of neurons, even if they are spread over an extended area.  The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, for example, is a thin layer of inhibitory neurons that surrounds the thalamus.
Some of the major anatomical components of the brain are organized as clusters of interconnected nuclei.  Notable among these are the thalamus and hypothalamus, each of which contains several dozen distinguishable substructures.  The medulla and pons also contain numerous small nuclei with a wide variety of sensory, motor, and regulatory functions.
In the peripheral nervous system, a cluster of neurons is referred to instead as a ganglion.

Participation in the Biological Weapons Convention
]]
The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction (usually referred to as the Biological Weapons Convention, abbreviation: BWC, or Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, abbreviation: BTWC) was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning the production of an entire category of weapons.The text of the Convention, as well as the key documents from recent meetings can be found on the BWC Implementation Support Unit website.
The Convention was the result of prolonged efforts by the international community to establish a new instrument that would supplement the 1925 Geneva Protocol.  The Geneva Protocol prohibited use but not possession or development of chemical and biological weapons.
A draft of the BWC, submitted by the British[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/pox_weapon_01.shtml |title=History – World Wars: Silent Weapon: Smallpox and Biological Warfare |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl] was opened for signature on 10 April 1972 and entered into force 26 March 1975 when twenty-two governments had deposited their instruments of ratification. It currently commits the 170 states which are party to it to prohibit the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons. However, the absence of any formal verification regime to monitor compliance has limited the effectiveness of the Convention. As of April 2013, an additional 10 states have signed the BWC but have yet to ratify the treaty.
The scope of the BWC's prohibition is defined in Article 1 (the so-called general purpose criterion). This includes all microbial and other biological agents or toxins and their means of delivery (with exceptions for medical and defensive purposes in small quantities). Subsequent Review Conferences have reaffirmed that the general purpose criterion encompasses all future scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention. It is not the objects themselves (biological agents or toxins), but rather certain purposes for which they may be employed which are prohibited; similar to Art.II, 1 in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Permitted purposes under the BWC are defined as prophylactic, protective and other peaceful purposes. The objects may not be retained in quantities that have no justification or which are inconsistent with the permitted purposes.
As stated in Article 1 of the BWC:
"Each State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain:

[[Particle swarm optimization]]

CATEGORIES: Optimization algorithms and methods, Evolutionary algorithms

In computer science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. PSO optimizes a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position but, is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.
PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.
PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. More specifically, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. PSO can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are partially irregular, noisy, change over time, etc.

In 1875, the cemetery was opened and named El Panteon Civil de Dolores. Juan Manuel Benfield founded the Cemetery in honor of his sister who died in Veracruz shortly after she had arrived from London with their parents.  As they were Anglicans, and all cemeteries in Veracruz were consecrated for use only by Roman Catholics, the only suitable burial ground to be had was on the beach. Today the cemetery has about 700,000 tombs, many with multiple occupants. [tpl]cite journal |last=Tegel |first=Simeon |date=1 December 2002|title= Crowd control.

Yeovil Town Football Club is an English football club based in the town of Yeovil, Somerset. It is the only Somerset-based club in the Football League, competing in the Championship, the second tier of English football. This was achieved after winning the play-off final on 19 May 2013 against Brentford having previously won the League Two championship in 2004–05.  Founded in 1895, Yeovil took 108 years to enter the Football League when they were promoted from the Football Conference as champions in 2003.
Yeovil have been one of the most successful non-league teams in the FA Cup – having defeated major Football League teams, most famously Sunderland in the 4th Round in 1949, going on to play in front of more than 81,000 against Manchester United at Maine Road. Since entering the Football League FA Cup results have deteriorated having only reached the 3rd Round twice including, in 2004, against Liverpool for which the club released a record prior to the tie sold only in shops in the town, "Yeovil True" reached #36 in the UK Singles Chart. The only other successful performance since then was in 2005 when they reached the 4th Round, drawn away against then Premier League side Charlton Athletic where they narrowly lost 3–2.
Their home ground is Huish Park, built in 1990 on the site of an old army camp and named after their former home, Huish, itself known for its pitch, which had an [tpl]convert|8|ft|m[/tpl] sideline to sideline slope.

The Middle Colonies comprised the middle region of the Thirteen Colonies of the British Empire in North America.
Much of the area was part of the New Netherland until the British exerted control over the region.  The French captured much of the area in its war with the Dutch around 1664, and the majority of the conquered land became the Province of New York. The Duke of York and the King of England would later grant others ownership of the land which would become the Province of New Jersey and the Province of Pennsylvania. The Delaware Colony later separated from Pennsylvania.
The Middle Colonies had rich soil, allowing the area to become a major exporter of wheat and other grains. The lumber and shipbuilding industries enjoyed success in the Middle Colonies because of the abundant forests, and Pennsylvania saw moderate success in the textile and iron industry. The Middle Colonies were the most ethnically and religiously diverse British colonies in North America, with settlers coming from all parts of Europe. Civil unrest in Europe and other colonies saw an influx of immigrants to the Middle Colonies in the 18th century. With the new arrivals came various religions which were protected in the Middle Colonies by written freedom of religion laws. This tolerance was unusual and distinct from other British colonies.

[[Biopsy]]

CATEGORIES: Biopsy, Pathology, Surgical procedures

A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon or an interventional radiologist involving sampling of cells or tissues for examination. It is the medical removal of tissue from a living subject to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. When only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissue’s cells, the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions.

Korean Confucianism is the form of Confucianism that emerged and developed in Korea. One of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural influence from China. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, high culture, and is the basis for much of the legal system. Confucianism in Korea is sometimes considered a pragmatic way of holding a nation together without the civil wars and internal dissent that were inherited from the Goryeo dynasty, and before.

[[Kaminaljuyu]]

Kaminaljuyu (pronounced kaminalχuʲu) is a Pre-Columbian site of the Maya civilization that was primarily occupied from 1500 BC to AD 1200. Kaminaljuyu has been described as one of the greatest of all archaeological sites in the New World by Michael Coe,Coe (2005, p. 52) although its remains today – a few mounds only – are far less impressive than other Maya sites more frequented by tourists. When first mapped scientifically (by E. M. Shook over a period of decades from the 1930s on), it comprised some 200 platforms and pyramidal mounds, at least half of which were created before the end of the Preclassic period (250 AD). Debate continues about the size, scale, and degree by which, as an economic and political entity, it integrated both the immediate Valley of Guatemala and the Southern Maya area.Kaplan, Jonathan 2011
The known parts of Kaminaljuyu lie on a broad plain beneath roughly the western third of modern Guatemala City. The Valley of Guatemala is surrounded by hills which culminate in a string of lofty volcanoes to the south. At an altitude of about 2000 m (7000 feet) above sea level, the climate is temperate. Soils are rich because of frequent volcanic eruptions; volcanic ash in the form of hardened tuff reaches depths of several hundred meters in and around Kaminaljuyu, and deep clefts or barrancas mark the landscape.
The Kaminaljuyu site largely was swallowed up by real estate developments in the late 20th century, although a portion of the Classic period center of Kaminaljuyu is preserved as a park. The distinctly unimpressive character of the extant remains is due not only to the location of the ancient city beneath a rapidly expanding Developing World capital city but also because the ancient architecture was constructed of hardened adobe, more perishable than the limestone used to build the cities in the Maya Lowlands. Because of these factors, the true size and scale of Kaminaljuyu likely will never be known.
The state of destruction and the almost daily erasure of archaeological context underscore the many mysteries, in addition to size and scale, that likely will remain unanswered about Kaminaljuyu. Principally these questions are posed about the role of the city as the greatest of the Southern Maya area (SMA) in Preclassic times, particularly during the "Miraflores" period, c. 400–100 BC;See Kaplan (2002, pp. 318–319) for a discussion of the "Miraflores"; the term is placed within quotation marks because it also refers to a sculptural carving style from Kaminaljuyu, described by Parsons (1986). the SMA is long believed from much and diverse evidence to have been seminal in the development of Maya civilization.

The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga occurred during the American Revolutionary War on May 10, 1775, when a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold overcame a small British garrison at the fort and looted the personal belongings of the garrison.  Cannons and other armaments from the fort were transported to Boston and used to fortify Dorchester Heights and break the standoff at the Siege of Boston.
After seizing Ticonderoga, a small detachment captured the nearby Fort Crown Point on May 11. Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men boldly raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on Lake Champlain.
Although the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent Continental Army a staging ground for the invasion of Quebec later in 1775.  It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, artillery from Ticonderoga would be dragged across Massachusetts to the heights commanding Boston harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city.

The Cache River is a tributary of the White River, 213 mi (343 km) long, in northeastern Arkansas in the United States.  Its headwaters also drain a small portion of southeastern Missouri.  Via the White River, the Cache is part of the Mississippi River watershed.
The Cache is formed by a confluence of agricultural ditches in Butler County, Missouri and soon enters Arkansas, flowing generally south-southwestwardly.  Several portions of the river's upper course have been straightened and channelized.  It joins the White River at the town of Clarendon, Arkansas.
The river is a slow muddy river with meandering channels, sloughs, swampy areas, and oxbow lakes.
The name of the river is probably a Picardie word meaning "hunt" as a reference to the abundant wildlife along the river. The first explorer into the area was Father Marquette, for whom Picard was the native tongue.
The low-lying areas in the vicinity of the river's lower course are a popular destination for duck hunters.  The Cache River National Wildlife Refuge along the lower river is the largest remaining tract of contiguous bottomland hardwood forest found in North America.  The refuge is also the most important wintering area for mallard ducks and other migratory waterfowl on the continent.
The river supports 53 mammalian species, over 200 bird species, and nearly 50 species of reptiles and amphibians.  The area has the only remaining population of native black bears in the state. This is also where the ivory-billed woodpecker was recently speculated to have been sighted (after it was believed to be extinct for 60 years).Audubon Magazine, July–August, 2007. Page 16.

Directoire style, [tpl]IPA-fr|di.ʁɛk.twaʁ[/tpl], describes a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design, concurrent with the post-Revolution French Directory (November 2, 1795 through November 10, 1799). The style uses Neoclassical architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. 
The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers Charles Percier (1764–1838) and Pier François Léonard Fontaine (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate Empire style, which was introduced after Napoleon established the First French Empire.
The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of republican Rome: "The stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. Conventionels saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after Brutus, Solon and Lycurgus. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by Jacques-Louis David as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of Salut Publique sat were made on antique models devised by David.... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable".Honour, 171

[[Neuroanatomy]]
CATEGORIES: Neuroanatomy, Nervous system, Neuroscience

Neuroanatomy is the study of the anatomy and stereotyped organization of nervous systems. In contrast to animals with radial symmetry, whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with bilateral symmetry have segregated, defined nervous systems, and thus we can make much more precise statements about their neuroanatomy. In vertebrates, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord (together called the central nervous system, or CNS) and the routes of the nerves that connect to the rest of the body (known as the peripheral nervous system, or PNS). The delineation of distinct structures and regions of the nervous system has been critical in investigating how it works. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or "lesions" to specific brain areas affects behavior or other neural functions.
For information about the composition of animal nervous systems, see nervous system. For information about the typical structure of the human nervous system, see human brain or peripheral nervous system. This article discusses information pertinent to the study of neuroanatomy.

All Razanne dolls are equipped with hijab.[tpl]cite book|last1=Morey|first1=Peter|last2=Yaqin|first2=Amina|title=Framing Muslims|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=46v5uCV9JBYC&pg=PA182|accessdate=19 August 2013|year=2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674048522|page=182[/tpl]  The United States media already calls Razanne the Muslim Barbie.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] There are also some further toys and accessories featuring Razanne as a character including a colouring book.
Saadeh hopes the doll will sell well in countries such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, where it has been sold since 2004. The doll is expected to sell well in Saudi Arabia, where the doll also debuted in 2004, because Saudi Arabian religious police have banned Barbie there, citing it as a threat to Muslim values.  
Apart from sales in the United States, the dolls are also sold in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Singapore.  
Another current doll featuring a positive, but identifiably Islamic female character is the Fulla doll marketed in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China, and Egypt. It is sold more profitably than Razanne.

[[Personal identification number]]
CATEGORIES: Banking terms, Personal identification documents, Password authentication

A personal identification number (PIN, pronounced "pin"; often redundantly PIN number) is a numeric password shared between a user and a system that can be used to authenticate the user to the system. Typically, the user is required to provide a non-confidential user identifier or token (the user ID) and a confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon the user ID and compares the looked-up PIN with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the number entered matches with the number stored in the system. Hence, despite the name, a PIN does not personally identify the user.Your ID number is not a password, Webb-site.com, 8 November 2010
The PIN is not printed or embedded on the card but is manually entered by the cardholder during automated teller machine (ATM) or point-of-sale (card present) transactions using debit cards or credit cards. In several countries, the traditional point of sale credit card signing process is increasingly being replaced with customer verification by PIN instead of signing. In some countries, including Australia, credit card companies announced that they will be ceasing[tpl]when|date=April 2014[/tpl] the practice of customer verification by signature or PIN in favour of verification by PIN only. In the UK and Ireland this goes under the term "Chip and PIN", because the use of a PIN to authenticate the customer was introduced at the same time as EMV chips on the cards.[tpl]cite news|title=Q&A: Chip and pin|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4705842.stm|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 February 2006[/tpl] In other parts of the world, PINs have been used before the introduction of EMV. 
PINs may also be used in contexts other than ATM or point-of-sale transactions, such as Internet transactions or to login onto a restricted website. In such cases the PIN may simply be a password, and not necessarily associated with a specific card.

The Independent Baptist Fellowship of North America (IBFNA) is a separatist fundamentalist independent Baptist fellowship for pastors and laymembers. Sometimes confused with the Independent Baptist Fellowship International (IBFI), the IBFNA is a northern-oriented fellowship formed by individuals who left the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC) due to what they felt was a drift of the association away from their original separatist position. The Fellowship was organized in October 1990 at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Its constitution was ratified in 1993 at Providence, Rhode Island. It is composed of individuals rather than churches. Individuals must renew their membership annually; churches are recognized as 'supporting churches' by financially supporting the Fellowship. This body is very local church oriented, and all boards, institutions, and agencies remain in the hands of the churches. Articles of Faith have been adopted, containing statements on the Scriptures, the Triune God, Salvation, Sanctification, the Church, Biblical Separation, Civil Government, Creation, The Fall of Man, the Devil, and End times. The Review is a quarterly published by the IBFNA. A Conference is held annually.
In 1994, the individual members of the Fellowship were from 106 different churches, 60 of which were not affiliated with other bodies and 46 were dually aligned with the IBFNA and the GARBC. The greatest strength of this group is in Pennsylvania. A few members are located in Canada. The Independent Baptist Fellowship of North America is a member of the American Council of Christian Churches.

[[Dolphins in mythology]]
CATEGORIES: Legendary mammals, Fictional toothed whales, Greek mythology, Cretan mythology, Mythological archetypes, Fictional dolphins

Dolphins appear in a number of Greek myths, invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos.
A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Taenarum, now Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.  (Herodotus I.23; Thucydides I.128, 133; Pausanias iii.25, 4)
The Greeks reimagined the Phoenician god Melqart as Melikertês (Melicertes) and made him the son of Athamas and Ino. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became Leucothea. (cf Ino.) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the Isthmian Games, originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of Melicertes.
Phalanthus was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to Pausanias.
Many seals and coins show a man or boy riding a dolphin.
Dionysus was once captured by Etruscan pirates who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been.  He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need.
Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and sometimes did errands for him as well.
Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.
In Hindu mythology the Ganges River Dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens http://www.worldwildlife.org/cetaceans/results/ganges.cfm and her mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.http://unesco.uiah.fi/water/material/02_water_and_enviroment_html
The Boto dolphins in the Amazon River are believed to be shapeshifters, or encantados, who are capable of having children with human women.
Even today, some superstitious mariners consider a vessel named Dolphin to be good luck on her sea voyages.

[[Queen's Park (Toronto)]]

CATEGORIES: Monuments and memorials in Toronto, Parks in Toronto, Reportedly haunted locations in Toronto

Queen's Park is an urban park in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1860 by Edward, Prince of Wales, it was named in honour of Queen Victoria. The park is the site of the Ontario Legislative Building, which houses the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and the phrase Queen's Park is regularly used as a metonym for the Government of Ontario. 
The park is nearly an enclave of the University of Toronto, which occupies most of the surrounding lands. The park itself is technically owned by the University of Toronto, but the property was leased to the Government of Ontario in 1859 for a period of 999 years, set to expire in 2858. Ministry buildings of the Ontario government occupy other properties to the east of the park, in an area between Wellesley Street and Grosvenor Street. While not directly adjacent to the park, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Gardiner Museum are both located nearby.

A Dutch oven is a thick-walled (usually cast iron but also ceramic and clay) cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid. Dutch ovens have been used as cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English speaking countries other than the USA ("casserole" means "pot" in French), and  cocottes in French. They are similar to both the Japanese tetsunabe and the Sač, a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African Potjie and the Australian Bedourie oven.

The Northeast Corridor (NEC) is a fully electrified railway line that serves the Northeast megalopolis of the United States. Owned primarily by Amtrak, it runs from Boston through New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to Washington, D.C.
The corridor is used by a large number of Amtrak trains, including the high-speed Acela Express, intercity trains, and several long-distance trains. Most of the corridor also has frequent commuter rail service, operated by the MBTA, Shore Line East, Metro-North Railroad, New Jersey Transit, SEPTA, and MARC. Additionally, freight service is operated over sections of the NEC by several companies.
The NEC, which closely parallels Interstate 95 for most of its length, is the busiest passenger rail line in the United States by both ridership and service frequency.[tpl]cite news|title=Transportation Statistics Annual Report|author=Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation|date=November 2005|url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2005/pdf/entire.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-02-18[/tpl] Branches to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Springfield, Massachusetts, though not considered part of the Northeast Corridor, see frequent service from routes that run largely on the corridor.
Much of the line is built for speeds higher than the [tpl]convert|79|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] generally permitted on U.S. tracks. This allows Amtrak to operate higher-speed rail service, such as the intercity Northeast Regional and Keystone Service trains that go up to [tpl]convert|125|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl], as well as North America's only high-speed train, the Acela Express, which runs up to [tpl]convert|150|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on several sections in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Acela covers the [tpl]convert|225|mi[/tpl] between New York and Washington, D.C., in under 3 hours, and the [tpl]convert|229|mi[/tpl] between New York and Boston in under 3.5 hours.
Under Amtrak's $151 billion Northeast Corridor plan, which aims to roughly halve travel times by 2040, trips between New York and Washington would take just 94 minutes.[tpl]cite web|title=The Amtrak Vision for the Northeast Corridor: 2012 Update Report |url=http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/453/325/Amtrak-Vision-for-the-Northeast-Corridor.pdf |publisher=Amtrak |format=PDF |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-10-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Paul|title=Amtrak's high-speed Northeast Corridor plan at $151 billion|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-10/news/32602302_1_amtrak-president-joseph-boardman-acela-express-northeast-corridor|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=10 July 2012[/tpl]

Although nominally independent, it was largely controlled by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and its main purpose was to be a buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan during the Russian Civil War. Its first president was Alexander Krasnoshchyokov.
The Far Eastern Republic occupied the territory of modern Zabaykalsky Krai, Amur Oblast, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, and Primorsky Krai of Russia (the former Transbaikal and Amur oblasts and Primorsky krai). Initially, its capital was Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), but from October 1920 it was moved to Chita.
After the fall of Vladivostok on 25 October 1922, the civil war was officially declared over. Three weeks later, on 15 November 1922, the Far Eastern Republic was merged with the RSFSR.

John Christopher Pratt CC (born 9 December 1935) is a Canadian painter and printmaker.
Christopher Pratt first started painting watercolours in 1952. In 1953 he attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick as a student in pre-medicine. At Mount Allison he quickly became interested in Fine Arts, especially painting. He was encouraged to paint by Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville. Pratt met his future wife at Mount Allison, artist Mary West.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/pratt.html |publisher=cbc.ca |title=Life and Times [/tpl] They married in 1957, and have 4 children: John, Barbara, Anne and Edwin. He and Mary separated in 1990. 
From 1957-1959 Pratt studied at the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. During the summers, he returned to Newfoundland to work as a construction surveyor at the American Naval Base at Argentia. The training he received in precise measuring was applied to his paintings. In 1959 Pratt returned to Mount Allison University to complete in 1961 a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. During this period he began to make silkscreen prints. The early screen print Boat in Sand, 1961 in the National Gallery’s collection was produced at this time and included in the Gallery’s fourth Biennial Exhibition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=4433|publisher=National Gallery of Canada| title=Christopher Pratt| accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl]

[[French post offices in China]]

CATEGORIES: Postage stamps of France, Postal system of France, Philately of China, China–France relations

The French post offices in China were among the post offices maintained by foreign powers in China from the mid-19th century until 1922. The first French Post Office in China opened in 1862.  Initially, the French government used ordinary French postage stamps for these offices.  These so-called "forerunner” stamps can be shown to have been sold or used in China only by a postmark.  Stamps used at Shanghai prior to 1876, for example, can only be identified by diamond-shaped cancel made of a type referred to (in French) as a “losange à gros chiffres” with the numbers "5104" in the center of the cancel.
Unlike the other foreign post offices in China, the French operated two distinct types of post offices in China.  Offices of the first type, typically located in French concessions and mostly in northern China, were run directly by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The offices of the second type, also referred to as the “Indochinese Offices” were located in southern China and operated under the direction of the postal administration of the nearby colony of French Indochina.Jacques Desrousseaux, "Bureaux Indochinois en Chine (Indochinese Offices in China, in French)".  Colfra Editions, Paris, 2011.  http://www.colfra.com/spip.php?article148
The Paris-run Post Offices in China and their opening dates are as follows:Dr. Jérôme Chane-Tune, Bureaux français et indochinois en Chine. Essai de nomenclature des timbres à date des bureaux de poste (1863-1922) and Indochinese PO in China - comprehensive and practical nomenclature of the datestamps used (1863 - 1922), Colfra Editions, Paris, 2005. http://membres.lycos.fr/jchane/HScolfra.html 
1862 
1889
1898
1900
1902
For the above post offices, the French government issued stamps of the "Peace and Commerce" series overprinted with the word "CHINE" beginning in 1894.  Stamp issues of the 20th century initially included overprints applied to some of the stamps issued for use in French Indochina, and continued with stamps printed specifically for use in China.  Some earlier 20th century stamps were issued only with face values expressed in French francs, but all later issues were overprinted with the equivalent of the stamp’s Chinese currency face value expressed in both French and Chinese. 
In addition to ordinary postage stamps, France also issued postal stationary and postage due stamps for use at the Paris-run Chinese post offices.   
The post offices run by French Indochina differed from the other French Post Offices in China in a number of areas.  Initially, the general issues of the Paris-run French Offices in China c. 1902-1904 were used, and these can be found with postmarks applied by the Indochinese offices.  But shortly thereafter, stamps were issued with overprints specific to the office that issued them.  For instance, the Canton office issued stamps overprinted “CANTON” rather than “CHINE.”  Seven such Indochinese post offices had these overprints (here written as they appeared on the stamps) along with their opening dates:
1900
1901
1902
1903
One additional way that the Indochinese offices differed from the other French Post Offices in China was that their issues were all overprints applied to the then-current stamps of French Indochina, rather than to the stamps of France.  The Paris-run offices would not accept mail franked with unoverprinted stamps of French Indochina, but the Indochinese run-offices are known to have done so.   For this reason, French Indochina stamps are sometimes found legitimately used with cancels from one of their Chinese offices.  Stamps from the Indochinese offices in China can likewise be found with cancels from Indochina proper, although these were likely applied at Hanoi or other locations through which mail had to pass, (i.e. these are essentially paquebot cancels.)
The Indochinese Offices in France also sometimes opened sub-post offices within the area they served.  For instance, the Canton office would eventually open six branches within the area it served.  The specific branch a Canton stamp was used at can sometimes be seen in the postmark.  Earlier Canton postmarks read “Canton / Chine” whereas later cancels include a letter from A to F to show at which branch of the Canton office they were used.
All foreign-run post offices in China permanently closed on 31 December 1922 Éditions Yvert & Tellier, "Catalogue de Timbres-Poste Tome 1". Éditions Yvert & Tellier, Paris, 2007. if they had not been closed earlier.     
One notable exception to this were the post offices in Kouang Tchéou Wan (usually written in English as “Kwangchowan”) which was a territory leased by treaty to France for a 99 year period starting in 1898.   This was an arrangement essentially similar to that covering Hong Kong’s “New Territories” from 1898 to 1997.Jacques Desrousseaux, "Territoire de Kouang Tchéou Wan  (Territory of Kwangchowan, in French)".  Colfra Editions, Paris, 2011.  http://www.colfra.com/spip.php?article149 
Due to its status as a leased territory still in existence after 1922, Kouang Tchéou was the only French postal entity in China to issue airmail stamps and semi-postal stamps, although most of these were issued by the government of Vichy France.   Due to war-time conditions and to the fact that the colonial authorities in Kouang Tchéou did not recognize the Vichy government, Vichy-issued stamps for Kouang Tchéou were never placed in use there.
French postal operations in Kouang-Tchéou continued until 1943, when the colony was occupied by the Japanese army.  Although France resumed sovereignty briefly over the colony for a few months at the end of the Second World War the territory was returned to China in early 1946.

[[Self-ionization of water]]
CATEGORIES: Water chemistry, Equilibrium chemistry, Acid-base chemistry

The self-ionization of water (also autoionization of water, and autodissociation of water) is an ionization reaction in pure water or an aqueous solution, in which a water molecule, H2O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus of one of its hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH−. The hydrogen nucleus, H+, immediately protonates another water molecule to form hydronium, H3O+. It is an example of autoprotolysis, and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.

The National Ignition Facility, or NIF, is a powerful laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. NIF uses powerful lasers to heat and compress a small amount of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place. NIF's mission is to achieve fusion ignition with high energy gain, and to support nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear weapons."About NIF & Photon Science", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/world-most-powerful-laser-120322.htm
Construction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted.

[[Object file]]

CATEGORIES: Executable file formats, Compiler construction, Computer libraries, Programming language implementation

An object file is a file containing object code, meaning relocatable format machine code that is usually not directly executable. Object files are produced by an assembler, compiler, or other language translator, and used as input to the linker, which in turn typically generates an executable or library by combining parts of object files. There are various formats for object files, and the same object code can be packaged in different object files.
In addition to the object code itself, object files may contain metadata used for linking or debugging, including: information to resolve symbolic cross-references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information.

[[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]
CATEGORIES: Intermediate-range ballistic missiles, Missile types

An intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) is a ballistic missile with a range of 3,000–5,500 km (1,864–3,418 miles), between a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Classifying ballistic missiles by range is done mostly for convenience, in principle there is very little difference between a low-performance ICBM and a high-performance IRBM. The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. Some other sources include an additional category, the long-range ballistic missile (LRBM), to describe missiles with a range between IRBMs and true ICBMs. The more modern term theater ballistic missile encompasses IRBMs, MRBMs and SRBMs, including any ballistic missile with a range under [tpl]convert|3500|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. 
IRBMs are currently operated by India, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Some other countries, such as Iran and North Korea, are said to be developing them. The United States, USSR, People's Republic of China, United Kingdom, and France were former operators.

[[Fate Marable]]

CATEGORIES: 1890 births, 1947 deaths, African-American musicians, American jazz pianists, American jazz organists, American jazz bandleaders, People from Paducah, Kentucky

Fate Marable (2 December 1890 – 16 January 1947) was a jazz pianist and bandleader.
Marable was born in Paducah, Kentucky, and learned piano from his mother. At age 17, he began playing on the steam boats plying the Mississippi River. He soon became bandleader for boats on the Streckfus Line, which ran several paddlewheelers which held dances and excursions along the river from New Orleans, Louisiana to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Marable appreciated the new "jazz" sound being played by the New Orleans musicians, and the bulk of his band members were recruited from that city.
Members of Marable's bands were expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, from hot numbers to light classics, both play by head and from sheet music, and above all to keep the dancers happy. Marable was a strict bandleader, demanding musical proficiency and rigid discipline from all his bandmembers, yet allowing them to develop their individual strong points. For instance, Louis Armstrong's gift for improvisation was recognised as such by Marable, and he allowed him to improvise his breaks rather than play them note for note. Marable's band served as an early musical education for many other players who would later become prominent in jazz, including Red Allen, Baby Dodds, Johnny Dodds, Pops Foster, Narvin Kimball, Al Morgan, Jimmy Blanton, and Zutty Singleton.
In addition to piano and bandleading, Marable played the boats' steam calliope, a contraption that could be heard for miles up and down the river and poured down so much water from condensing steam that Marable performed wearing a raincoat and hood.
Fate Marable died of pneumonia in St. Louis, Missouri. He was 56 years old. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Paducah, Ky.
A young George Russell, later notable for formulating the Lydian Concept, grew up listening to Marable's music.
Fate was a relative of the drummer Larance Marable.Interview, DAVID EASTLEE - LIVE FROM MR. B's

[[Material safety data sheet]]

A material safety data sheet (MSDS), safety data sheet (SDS),United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev04/04files_e.html or product safety data sheet (PSDS) is
an important component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. It is intended to provide workers and emergency personnel with procedures for handling or working with that substance in a safe manner, and includes information such as physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. MSDS formats can vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements.
SDSs are a widely used system for cataloging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential hazards associated with a particular material or product. These data sheets can be found anywhere where chemicals are being used.
There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical, health and/or environmental risk. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background, used to denote a harmful substance.
An SDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer, focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting.
In some jurisdictions, the MSDS is required to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.
It is important to use an MSDS specific to both country and supplier, as the same product (e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company) can have different formulations in different countries. The formulation and hazard of a product using a generic name (e.g. sugar soap) may vary between manufacturers in the same country.

Cosmas Damian Asam (September 29, 1686 – May 10, 1739) was a German painter and architect during the late Baroque period.  Born  in Benediktbeuern, he moved to Rome in 1711 to study at the Accademia di San Luca with Carlo Maratta. There, he could see the fresco Ascent of Christ by Melozzo da Forlì in the Basilica Santi Apostoli. Melozzo's innovative techniques of foreshortening influenced Asam's works. In 1713 Asam won the Academy's first prize for his drawing of Miracle of Saint Pio. He worked with his brother Egid Quirin and their joint projects are often attributed to the "Asam Brothers". These include the Asam Church in Munich and Innsbruck Cathedral. Cosmas Damian died in Munich.

The West Australian Football League (WAFL) is an Australian rules football league based in Perth, Western Australia. The WAFL is the second-most popular league in the state, behind the nation-wide Australian Football League (AFL). The league currently consists of nine teams, which play each other in a 24-round season usually lasting from March to September, with the top four teams playing off in a finals series, culminating in a Grand Final. The league also runs reserves and colts (under-19[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wafootball.com.au/resources/doc_download/268-wafl-rules-and-regulations | title=Rules and Regulations | publisher=West Australian Football Commission | accessdate=29 March 2012 | pages=52[/tpl]) competitions.
The WAFL was founded in 1885 as the West Australian Football Association (WAFA), and has undergone a variety of name changes since then, re-adopting its current name in 2001. For most of its existence, the league was considered one of the tradition "big three" Australian rules football leagues, along with the Victorian Football League (VFL) and South Australian National Football League (SANFL). However, since the introduction of two Western Australia-based clubs into the VFL (later renamed the Australian Football League) – the West Coast Eagles in 1987 and the Fremantle Football Club in 1995 – the popularity and standard of the league has decreased to the point where it is considered a feeder competition to the AFL.
Although payments are made to players, it is generally considered to be a semi-professional competition. A salary cap of A$200,000 per club is in place. The league is currently affiliated with the two Western Australia-based AFL clubs. Players who are not selected to play with their respective AFL clubs instead play for allocated clubs in the WAFL. The competition is governed by the West Australian Football Commission, and based at Subiaco Oval.

Stations of the Cross (or Way of the Cross; in Latin, Via Crucis; also called the Via Dolorosa or Way of Sorrows, or simply, The Way) refers to a series of artistic representations, often sculptural, depicting Christ Carrying the Cross to his crucifixion. Most Roman Catholic churches contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the side walls of the nave; in most churches, they are small plaques with reliefs or paintings.  The tradition of moving around the Stations to commemorate the Passion of Christ began with St. Francis of Assisi and extended throughout the Roman Catholic Church in the medieval period. It is also observed in Lutheranismhttp://www.trinitycamphill.org/Way%20of%20the%20Cross/Introduction.htmhttp://pastorzip.blogspot.com/2007/04/stations-of-cross.html and Anglo-Catholicism.

David Copeland (born 15 May 1976) is an English Neo-Nazi militant who became known as the "London Nail Bomber" after a 13-day bombing campaign in April 1999 aimed at London's black, Bangladeshi and gay communities that resulted in three people killed and more than a hundred injured.Buncombe, Andrew; Judd, Terri; and Bennett, Jason. "'Hate-filled' nailbomber is jailed for life", The Independent, 30 June 2000. Widely labelled a terrorist, Copeland was a former member of two far right political groups, the British National Party and then the National Socialist Movement.
Over three successive weekends between 17 and 30 April, Copeland placed homemade nail bombs, each containing up to 1,500 four-inch nails, in holdalls that he left in public spaces around London.  The first bomb was placed outside the Iceland supermarket in Electric Avenue, Brixton, an area of south London with a large black population.  The second was in Brick Lane in the East End of London, which has a large Bangladeshi community.  The third was inside the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho's Old Compton Street, the heart of London's gay community.  The bombs killed three people, including a pregnant woman, and injured 139, four of whom lost limbs.
Copeland was diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia, while one diagnosed a personality disorder not serious enough to avoid a charge of murder.  His plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was not accepted by the prosecution or jury.Hopkins, Nick and Hall, Sarah. "David Copeland: a quiet introvert, obsessed with Hitler and bombs", The Guardian, 30 June 2000. He was convicted of murder on 30 June 2000, and given six concurrent life sentences. In 2007 the High Court ruled that he must serve at least 50 years. He appealed the ruling, which the Court of Appeal upheld in 2011."Nail bomber David Copeland loses sentence appeal", BBC News, 28 June 2011.

Longyearbyen is the largest settlement and the administrative center of Svalbard, Norway. As of 2008, the town had a population of 2,040. Longyearbyen is located in the valley of Longyeardalen and on the shore of Adventfjorden, a bay of Isfjorden located on the west coast of Spitsbergen. Since 2002, Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality, including utilities, education, cultural facilities, fire department, roads and ports. The town is the seat of the Governor of Svalbard. It is the world's northernmost town, and the northernmost settlement of any kind with greater than 1,000 permanent residents.
Known as Longyear City until 1926, the town was established by and named after John Munro Longyear, whose Arctic Coal Company started coal mining operations in 1906. Operations were taken over by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) in 1916, which still conducts mining. The town was almost completely destroyed by the German Kriegsmarine on 8 August 1943, but was rebuilt after the Second World War. Traditionally, Longyearbyen was a company town, but most mining operations have moved to Sveagruva since the 1990s, while the town has seen a large increase in tourism and research. This has seen the arrival of institutions such as the University Centre in Svalbard, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and Svalbard Satellite Station. The community is served by Svalbard Airport, Longyear and Svalbard Church.

[[Corporation (university)]]

CATEGORIES: Student organizations

The term corporation refers to different kinds of student organizations worldwide. Generally, universities in the various European countries have student organizations called corporations. The name is derived from the Latin corporatio meaning a body or group. There was an earlier type of student organization, called a nation from the Middle Ages, where students from all over Europe at a particular university would unite according to national (actually regional) lines.

[[Eephus pitch]]

CATEGORIES: Baseball pitches

An Eephus pitch (also spelled Ephus) in baseball is a very low speed junk pitch.[tpl]cite book | authorlink = Paul Dickson | title= The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=afQVWhAm1TEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA284,M1 | accessdate= 2009-01-21 |date=January 1999 | publisher=Harvest Books | isbn = 0-15-600580-8 | page = 284[/tpl] The delivery from the pitcher has very low velocity and usually catches the hitter off-guard.  Its invention is attributed to Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s.  According to manager Frankie Frisch, the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays.  When asked what it meant, Van Robays replied, "'Eephus ain't nothing, and that's a nothing pitch." Although the origin is not known for certain,  Eephus may come from the Hebrew word [tpl]Script/Hebrew|אפס[/tpl] (pronounced "EFF-ess"), meaning "nothing".[tpl]cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=eephus/080715 | title = The something pitch | accessdate = 2009-01-16 | author = Paul Jackson | date = July 17, 2008 | publisher = ESPN[/tpl]
The Eephus pitch is thrown overhand like most pitches, but is characterized by an unusual, high arcing trajectory with a peak around 20–25 feet.[tpl]cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/writers/john_donovan/04/15/eephus.pitch/ | title = 'LaLob' it in | accessdate = August 15, 2012| author = John Donovan | date = April 16, 2004 | work = Sports Illustrated [/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Paul Dickson|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ceeU7xSLw5kC&pg=PA287|accessdate=August 15, 2012|date=13 June 2011|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-34008-2|pages=287–288, 686[/tpl] The corresponding slow velocity bears more resemblance to a slow-pitch softball delivery than to a traditional baseball pitch. It is considered a trick pitch because, in comparison to normal baseball pitches – which run from 70 to 100 miles per hour – an Eephus pitch appears to move in slow motion at 55 miles per hour or less, sometimes into the low-40s.

[[Almere Haven]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Flevoland, Almere

Almere Haven is the oldest part of Almere. Although Almere Haven does not have its own railway station, it is well-connected to Amsterdam and the rest of Almere by a good bus rapid transit system.
Almere Haven has a small harbour with ferry connections to the Dutch mainland, and is surrounded by large forests of poplars containing buzzards, foxes, small deer, and owls. The closest forests are Het Beginbos and Waterlandsebos.
Almere Haven features the most idealistic architecture in Almere, when the goal was to build a model city on the newly reclaimed land of Flevoland. The city was planned before increasing population pressure in Almere and rising property prices caused compromises on the original vision.
All housing developments are built to provide views of greenery and open spaces, and each group of houses is clustered around a little park, usually with easy access to the surrounding forests, so residents of Almere Haven do not have the sense of living in a crowded urban area.
Almere Haven does not have the inconveniences of busy traffic, car pollution, and road noise because all roads are cul-de-sacs connecting to a well-hidden ring road that provides the only car access in and out of Almere Haven. The bus road system also forms a ring and most residents are no more than a few minutes walk from a bus stop.

[[Studio glass]]

CATEGORIES: Glass art, Sculpture, Art media

Studio glass or glass sculpture is the modern use of glass as an artistic medium to produce sculptures or three-dimensional artworks.  The glass objects created are intended to make a sculptural or decorative statement. On the market, their prices may range from a few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars (US).
As a decorative and functional medium, glass was extensively developed in Egypt and Assyria. invented by the Phoenicians, was brought to the fore by the Romans.  In the Middle Ages, the builders of the great Norman and Gothic cathedrals of Europe took the art of glass to new heights with the use of stained glass windows as a major architectural and decorative element.  Glass from Murano, in the Venetian Lagoon,  (also known as Venetian glass) is the result of hundreds of years of refinement and invention. Murano is still held as the birthplace of modern glass art.
The turn of the 19th Century was the height of the old art glass movement while the factory glass blowers were being replaced by mechanical bottle blowing and continuous window glass. Great ateliers like Tiffany, Lalique, Daum, Gallé, the Corning schools in upper New York state, and Steuben Glass Works took glass art to the highest levels. 
During the early 20th-century (before the early 1960s), contemporary glass art had mostly been glass made by teams of factory workers, taking glass from furnaces containing a thousand or more pounds of glass. This form of glass art, of which Tiffany and Steuben in the U.S.A., Gallé in France and Hoya Crystal in Japan, Royal Leerdam Crystal in the Netherlands and Orrefors and Kosta Boda in Sweden are perhaps the best known, grew out of the factory system in which all glass objects were hand or mold blown by teams of 4 or more people. 
Modern glass studios use a great variety of techniques in creating glass artworks, including working glass at room temperature cold working, stained glass, working glass in a torch flame (lampworking), glass beadmaking, glass casting, glass fusing, and, most notably, glass blowing.

[[Mahalath]]

Mahalath (Hebrew מָחֲלַת, meaning either "sickness", "a company of dancers" or "a harp") was the third mentioned wife of Esau, a daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebajoth. Esau took Mahalath from the house of Ishmael to be his wife, after seeing that Canaanite wives displeased his father, Isaac ([tpl]bibleverse||Genesis|28:6-9[/tpl]).
It has been proposed by some biblical scholars that Mahalath is another name for Esau's wife Basemath who is mentioned in Genesis 36. J.B. Phillips suggests that Esau changed the names of his Hittite wives, Judith and Basemath, as a way of pacifying his parents Phillips, J.

CATEGORIES: Sexual acts, Virtue

Coitus reservatus (coitus, "sexual intercourse, union" + reservatus, "reserved, saved"),Cassell's Compact Latin Dictionary, Dell Publishing Co. Inc., 1963 also known as sexual continence, is commonly thought of as a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to ejaculate within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the plateau phase of intercourse for as long as possible avoiding the seminal emission. Another term used for this kind of relationship is the word karezza.
According to its creator, Alice Stockham, the word karezza is derived from the Italian word "carezza" meaning "caress". However, Alan Watts believed, in error, that it was a Persian word.[tpl]cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |title=Nature, Man and Woman |page=172 |year=1970 |publisher=Random House Inc.

The Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhees has been under debate in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the Spotted Towhee were considered a single species, the Rufous-sided Towhee.
Their breeding habitat is brushy areas across eastern North America. They nest either low in bushes or on the ground under shrubs. Northern birds migrate to the southern United States. There has been one record of this species as a vagrant to western Europe; a single bird in Great Britain in 1966.
The song is a short Drink your teeeeea lasting around one second, starting with a sharp call ("drink!") and ending with a short trill "teeeeea". The name "towhee" is onomatopoeic description of one of the towhee's most common calls, a short two-part call rising in pitch and sometimes also called a "chewink" call.

In the human male reproductive system, retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen, which would normally be ejaculated via the urethra, is redirected to the urinary bladder. Normally, the sphincter of the bladder contracts before ejaculation forcing the semen to exit via the urethra, the path of least pressure. When the bladder sphincter does not function properly, retrograde ejaculation may occur.

Walter Jurmann (October 12, 1903 - June 17, 1971) was an Austrian-born composer of popular music renowned for his versatility who, after emigrating to the United States, specialized in film scores and soundtracks.
Born in Vienna, Jurmann received a classical education, taking his Matura exams in 1921. For some time he studied medicine but in 1924, after working as a lounge pianist in a posh hotel in the Semmering area of Lower Austria, abandoned his studies altogether in order to pursue a career in music. He moved to Berlin and soon became successful with tunes such as "Du bist nicht die Erste". Probably his most famous 1920s song is "Veronika, der Lenz ist da", popularized by the all-male a cappella ensemble, the Comedian Harmonists. With the arrival of sound movies Jurmann also began writing film music, starting with Ihre Majestät, die Liebe (Her Majesty, Love) (1930). Jurman's melodies were so charming and easy to remember that a contemporary paper reported that cinemagoers were humming the new tunes already on the morning following the release of a new film.
In 1933, after the Nazis had come to power, Jurmann left Berlin for Paris, France, where he continued writing songs, occasionally incorporating elements of the French chanson. In 1934 he met Louis B. Mayer, who offered him a seven-year contract with MGM. Subsequently, Jurmann and his partner, Polish-born composer Bronisław Kaper (1902 - 1983), went to Hollywood. Jurmann's successful films include Mutiny on the Bounty (1935) ("Love Song of Tahiti"), the 1936 movie San Francisco ("Theme from San Francisco"), the 1937 Marx Brothers' A Day at the Races ("All God's Chillun Got Rhythm"), and Presenting Lily Mars (1943) starring Judy Garland.
In the early 1940s Jurmann, who had settled down in Los Angeles, withdrew from the film business although he continued writing Ohrwürmer up to his death. In 1953 he married Yvonne Jellinek, a Hungarian fashion designer whom he had met at a party in the U.S. In 1971, during a trip to Europe, he died unexpectedly of a heart attack in Budapest, his wife's home town. He is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.

Jesse William Dirkhising (May 24, 1986 – September 26, 1999), also known as Jesse Yates, was an American teenager from Prairie Grove, Arkansas, who was kidnapped by two men who bound, drugged, tortured and repeatedly raped him. Dirkhising died from drugging and positional asphyxia during the ordeal. LiebLieb"Lawyer to request...", Washington Times, Nov. 20, 1999
Dirkhising's death received only regional media coverage until a Washington Times article ran a story nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of national coverage in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of Matthew Shepard.Kuypers[tpl]pageneeded|date=June 2013[/tpl] The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and as such was getting another round of national attention coupled with updates on pending hate crime legislation. Prompted by coverage in the Washington Times, the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as conservative commentators compared media coverage of the two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a hate crime. The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.[tpl]pageneeded|date=June 2013[/tpl]Bozell, "No Media Spotlight ..."
The media coverage of the Dirkhising case was repeatedly and consistently contrasted with that of the high-profile Shepard case, although the cases were dissimilar in several important details. While both victims died as the result of assaults by two men, Dirkhising was a minor and the victim of a sex crime, while Shepard, an adult, was murdered as part of a hate crime.[tpl]pageneeded|date=June 2013[/tpl]Buchanan While homosexuality has been cited as an issue in both cases, the circumstances were different and in contrast: Shepard was an openly gay man who was attacked by two heterosexual men, while Dirkhising was raped by two men who were described as "lovers" in a police affidavit."Killer:Shephard ..."

The Dragunov sniper rifle (formal [tpl]lang-ru|Снайперская Винтовка системы Драгунова образца 1963 года[/tpl] Snayperskaya Vintovka sistem'y Dragunova obraz'tsa 1963 goda (SVD-63), officially "Sniper Rifle, System of Dragunov, Model of the Year 1963") is a semi-automatic sniper/designated marksman rifle chambered in 7.62×54mmR and developed in the Soviet Union.
The Dragunov was designed as a squad support weapon since, according to Soviet and Soviet-derived military doctrines, the long-range engagement ability was lost to ordinary troops when submachine guns and assault rifles (which are optimized for close-range and medium-range, rapid-fire combat) were adopted. For that reason, it was originally named Самозарядная Винтовка системы Драгунова образца 1963 года "Self-Loading Rifle, System of Dragunov, Model of the Year 1963."
It was selected as the winner of a contest that included three competing designs: by Sergei Simonov, Aleksandr Konstantinov and Yevgeny Dragunov. Extensive field testing of the rifles conducted in a wide range of environmental conditions resulted in Dragunov’s proposal being accepted into service in 1963. An initial pre-production batch consisting of 200 rifles was assembled for evaluation purposes, and from 1964 serial production was carried out by Izhmash.
Since then, the Dragunov has become the standard squad support weapon of several countries, including those of the former Warsaw Pact. Licensed production of the rifle was established in China (Type 79 and Type 85) and Iran (as a direct copy of the Chinese Type 79).

Heilmann was a line drive hitter who won four American League batting crowns, in 1921, 1923, 1925 & 1927. He and Ted Williams are the last two American League players to hit .400, Heilmann having accomplished the feat in 1923 at .403.

He is among the all-time major league leaders in doubles with 542, triples with 151 and RBIs with 1,539. He played in 2,148 major league games, 1,327 in right field and 448 at first base, and was also the first to hit at least one home run in every major league ballpark in use during his career.

Samuel Earl "Sam" Crawford (April 18, 1880 – June 15, 1968), nicknamed "Wahoo Sam", was a Major League Baseball player who played outfield for the Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers from 1899 to 1917. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1957.
Crawford batted and threw left-handed, stood [tpl]height|ft=6|in=0[/tpl] tall and weighed 190 pounds. He was one of the greatest sluggers of the dead-ball era and still holds the Major League's records for triples in a career (309) and inside-the-park home runs in a season (12). He has the second best all-time record for most inside-the-park home runs in a career (51). He finished his career with 2,961 hits and a .309 batting average, and became first player to lead both American League and the National League in home runs (1901 and 1908).
Baseball legend Ed Barrow, who managed Crawford in his first two years with Detroit, and went on to convert Babe Ruth to an outfielder as general manager of the Yankees, once said that there never was a better hitter than Crawford.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Crawford.Sam.Obit.html|title=THE OBIT FOR SAM CRAWFORD|last=|first=|date=|publisher=TheDeadBallEra.com|accessdate=[/tpl]  One of his contemporaries, Fielder Jones, said of Crawford: “None of them can hit quite as hard as Crawford.

[[Delphi method]]

The Delphi method ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|f|aɪ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|DEL|fy[/tpl]) is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts.Norman Dalkey, Olaf Helmer (1963) An Experimental Application of the Delphi Method to the use of experts. Management Science, 9(3), Apr 1963, pp 458-467Bernice B. Brown (1968).

(1974), "Delphi Assessment: Expert Opinion, Forecasting and Group Process", R-1283-PR, April 1974. Brown, Thomas, "An Experiment in Probabilistic Forecasting", R-944-ARPA, 1972 The experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts’ forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the "correct" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a pre-defined stop criterion (e.g. number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results) and the mean or median scores of the final rounds determine the results.Rowe and Wright (1999): The Delphi technique as a forecasting tool: issues and analysis. International Journal of Forecasting, Volume 15, Issue 4, October 1999. 
Delphi is based on the principle that forecasts (or decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups.Rowe and Wright (2001): Expert Opinions in Forecasting. Role of the Delphi Technique. In: Armstrong (Ed.): Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook of Researchers and Practitioners, Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers. The technique can also be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimate-Talk-Estimate (ETE).

The Frascati Manual is a document setting forth the methodology for collecting statistics about research and development. The Manual was prepared and published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
In June 1963, OECD experts met with the NESTI group (National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators) at the Villa Falconieri in Frascati, Italy. Based on a background document by Christopher Freeman they drafted the first version of Frascati Manual, which is officially known as The Proposed Standard Practice for Surveys of Research and Experimental Development.  In 2002 the 6th edition was published.
The manual gives definitions for: basic research, applied research, Research and development; research personnel: researchers, technicians, auxiliary personnel. It also organizes Field of science into main and sub-categories.
It deals primarily with measuring the expenditure and personnel resources devoted to R&D in the industry sectors performing it: higher education, government, business, and private non-profit organisations.
The definitions provided in the Frascati Manual have been adopted by many governments and serve as a common language for discussions of science and technology policy and economic development policy. Originally an OECD standard, it has become an acknowledged standard in R&D studies all over the world and is widely used by various organisations associated with the United Nations and European Union.
Over the past 40 years, the NESTI group has developed a series of documents, known as the "Frascati Family", that includes manuals on R&D (Frascati Manual), innovation (Oslo Manual), human resources (Canberra Manual), technology, balance of payments, and patents as indicators of science and technology.

Hugh Ambrose Jennings (April 2, 1869 – February 1, 1928) was a Major League Baseball player and manager from 1891 to 1925.  Jennings was a leader, both as a batter and as a shortstop, with the Baltimore Orioles teams that won National League championships in 1894, 1895, and 1896.  During the three championship seasons, Jennings had 355 RBIs and hit .335, .386, and .401.  Jennings was a fiery, hard-nosed player who was not afraid to be hit by a pitch to get on base.  In 1896, he was hit by a pitch 51 times – a major league record that has never been broken.  Jennings also holds the career record for being hit by a pitch with 287, with Craig Biggio (who retired in 2007) holding the modern-day career record of 285.  Jennings also played on the Brooklyn Superbas teams that won National League pennants in 1899 and 1900.  From 1907-1920, Jennings was the manager of the Detroit Tigers, where he was known for his colorful antics, hoots, whistles, and his famous shouts of "Ee-Yah"  from the third base coaching box.  Jennings suffered a nervous breakdown in 1925 that forced him to leave Major League Baseball.  He died in 1928 and was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945.

[[Information foraging]]

CATEGORIES: Human–computer interaction

Information foraging is a theory that applies the ideas from optimal foraging theory to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use "built-in" foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food.  Importantly, better understanding of human search behaviour can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface.

[[Category of vector spaces]]
CATEGORIES: Category-theoretic categories, Linear algebra

In mathematics, especially category theory, the category K-Vect (some authors use VectK) has all vector spaces over a fixed field K as objects and K-linear transformations as morphisms. If K is the field of real numbers, then the category is also known as Vec.
Since vector spaces over K (as a field) are the same thing as modules over the ring K, K-Vect is a special case of R-Mod, the category of left R-modules. K-Vect is an important example of an abelian category.
Much of linear algebra concerns the description of K-Vect.  For example, the dimension theorem for vector spaces says that the isomorphism classes in K-Vect correspond exactly to the cardinal numbers, and that K-Vect is equivalent to the subcategory of K-Vect which has as its objects the free vector spaces Kn, where n is any cardinal number.
There is a forgetful functor from K-Vect to Ab, the category of abelian groups, which takes each vector space to its additive group.  This can be composed with forgetful functors from Ab to yield other forgetful functors, most importantly one to Set.
K-Vect is a monoidal category with K (as a one-dimensional vector space over K) as the identity and the tensor product as the monoidal product.

Amersham station is a London Underground and National Rail station in the town of Amersham, in the Chiltern district of Buckinghamshire, England.
Amersham station is a terminus of the London Underground's Metropolitan line. It is situated 23.7 miles (38.1 km) north west of Charing Cross, making it the second furthest Underground station from central London and the second most westerly station on the whole London Underground system, after [tpl]LUL stations|station=Chesham[/tpl].O.S. Map As a consequence, it is in Travelcard Zone 9 (previously zone D).
Amersham station is also served by Chiltern Railways, which runs trains between London Marylebone and Aylesbury. From Aylesbury a shuttle service to Princes Risborough provides access to through services between Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill. The journey times to Central London range between 33 and 60 minutes. Ticket barriers are in operation at this station.
In 2009, because of financial constraints, Transport for London (TfL) decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Amersham and five other stations, on the grounds that these are relatively quiet stations and some are already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/Disability-and-deaf-equality-scheme-accessible-version-2009-12.doc|publisher=TfL|title=Disability and Deaf Equality Scheme (DES) 2009-2012|accessdate=1 December 2010[/tpl] The next station towards London, Chalfont & Latimer, and Chesham station, around [tpl]convert|2|mi|km[/tpl] north, both have step-free access.

Pachelbel's Canon is the name commonly given to a canon by the German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel in his Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo (German: [tpl]lang|de|Kanon und Gigue für 3 Violinen mit Generalbaß[/tpl]) (PWC 37, T. 337, PC 358). It is his most famous composition. It was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue. Both movements are in the key of D major.
Like most other works by Pachelbel and other pre-1700 composers, the Canon remained forgotten for centuries and was rediscovered only in the 20th century. Several decades after it was first published in 1919 the piece became extremely popular. The piece was particularly prevalent in the pop charts of the 1990s, being sampled and appropriated in numerous commercial hits such as Pet Shop Boys cover of "Go West", Coolio's "C U When U Get There" and Green Day's "Basket Case".Chamings, Andrew Wallace. 2013.Canon in the 1990s: From Spiritualized to Coolio, Regurgitating Pachelbel's Canon It is frequently played at weddings and included on classical music compilations, along with other famous Baroque pieces such as 'Air on the G String'.
Although a true canon at the unison in three parts, it also has elements of a chaconne. It has been frequently arranged and transcribed for many different media.

[[Echocardiography]]
CATEGORIES: Cardiac imaging, Medical ultrasonography, Radiology, Cardiology

Echocardiogram, often referred to as a cardiac echo or simply an echo, is a sonogram of the heart. (It is not abbreviated as ECG, which in medicine usually refers to an electrocardiogram.) Echocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.
Echocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An Echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).
Echocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of Stress Echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is noninvasive (doesn't involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.
Not only can an echocardiogram create ultrasound images of heart structures, but it can also produce accurate assessment of the blood flowing through the heart, using pulsed or continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. This allows assessment of both normal and abnormal blood flow through the heart. Color Doppler as well as spectral Doppler is used to visualize any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and to estimate how well the valves open (or do not open in the case of valvular stenosis).
Echocardiography was also the first ultrasound subspecialty to use intravenous contrast. (See Contrast Echocardiography)
Echocardiography is performed by cardiac sonographers, cardiac physiologists (UK) or doctors trained in echocardiography.

The Christian Community is led by the "circle of priests," with leaders known as coordinators appointed within the circle. A first coordinator (Erzoberlenker) is consulted by two second coordinators (Oberlenkers). There are also third coordinators (Lenkers) on the regional level and a synod of priests. There is no additional ordination for the leadership. The priesthood of the Christian Community has always been open to women.

Thomas Murner (24 December 1475 – c. 1537) was a German satirist, poet and translator.[tpl]Cite CE1913|wstitle=Thomas Murner[/tpl]
He was born at Oberehnheim (Obernai) near Strasbourg. In 1490 he entered the Franciscan order, and in 1495 began travelling, studying and then teaching and preaching in Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Paris, Kraków and Strasbourg itself. The emperor Maximilian I crowned him in 1505 poeta laureatus; in 1506, he was created doctor theologiae, and in 1513 was appointed custodian of the Franciscan monastery in Strasbourg, an office which he was forced to vacate the following year for having published a scurrilous book. Later in life, in 1518, he began the study of jurisprudence at the University of Basel, and in 1519 took the degree of doctor juris.
In the summer of 1523, at the invitation of Henry VIII, he went to England, where his writings had caught the attention of Thomas More.
John Headley credits Murner for making More aware of the radical nature of Luther's ecclesiology.
Henry VIII felt that Murner was an important orthodox influence in Strasbourg and give him £100 and a letter to the city magistrates.
After this stay, and a journey in Italy, he again settled in Strasbourg, but, disturbed by the Protestant Reformation, went into exile at Lucerne in Switzerland in 1526. In 1533 he was appointed priest of Oberehnheim, where he died in 1537, or, according to some accounts, in 1536.
Murner was an energetic and passionate character, but made enemies wherever he went. There is little human kindness in his satires, which were directed against the corruption of the times, the Reformation, and especially against Martin Luther. His most powerful satire—the most virulent German satire of the period—is Von dem grossen Lutherischen Narren wie ihn Doctor Murner beschworen hat. Others included Die Narrenbeschwörung (1512); Die Schelmenzunft (1512); Die Gäuchmatt, which treats of enamoured fools (1519), and a translation of Virgil's Aeneid (1515) dedicated to the emperor Maximilian I. Murner also wrote the humorous Chartiludium logicae (1507) and the Ludus studentum Friburgensium (1511), besides a translation of Justinian's Institutiones (1519).
Murner's satires were edited in the 1840s by Johann Scheible.

Raymond "Ray" Clarence Ewry (October 14, 1873 – September 29, 1937) was an American track and field athlete who won 8 gold medals at the Olympic Games and 2 gold medals at the Intercalated Games (1906 in Athens). This puts him among the most successful Olympians of all time. His 8 Olympic gold medals in individual events (i.e. non-relay) are second only to Michael Phelps's 11.
Ewry was born in Lafayette, Indiana, and contracted polio as a young boy. For a short while, he was in a wheelchair, and it was feared that he might become paralysed for life. 
However, Ewry did his own exercises and overcame his illness. Ewry attended Purdue University, where he became a member of Sigma Nu Fraternity.  After receiving a graduate degree in engineering at Purdue, he became a member of the New York Athletic Club. There, he specialised in now defunct events, the standing jumps: the standing high jump, the standing long jump and the standing triple jump. These events are identical to their normal versions, but are contested without a run-up.
Ewry proved to be the best standing jumper in the world. At his first Olympics, held in Paris (1900), he won gold medals in all three standing jumps. Incidentally, all three finals were held on the same day (July 16). 
At the 1904 Summer Olympics, Ewry successfully defended all three of his titles. The standing triple jump event was discontinued after those Olympics, but Ewry continued to dominate the two remaining standing jump events at both the 1906 Intercalated Games and 1908 Games, thus bringing his total to 10 Olympic gold titles including two from the Intercalated Games, the highest number achieved until 2008. The 1906 Intercalated Games are currently not officially recognised by the IOC, although they were organized as an Olympic event by the IOC. Most historians do consider them as real Olympics, though. Even if the 1906 games are removed from his totals, he stands ([tpl]As of|2008|lc=on[/tpl]) as the 12th most successful Olympian of all time in terms of total individual medals and second most successful in terms of individual gold medals. The standing jumping events were no longer held in the Olympics after 1912.
Ewry's superiority is also displayed by the fact that his world record in the standing long jump ([tpl]convert|3.48|m|ftin|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]Ray's Results at databaseolympics.com) was still standing when the event was discontinued internationally in the 1930s.

[[Defence minister]]

CATEGORIES: Defence ministers, Government ministers by portfolio, Lists of government ministers

The title Defence Minister, also known as Minister of Defence, Minister for Defence, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of National Defense or some similar variation, is assigned to the person in a cabinet position in charge of a Ministry of Defence, which regulates the armed forces in some sovereign nations. The minister usually has a very important role in a cabinet.
When cabinets first started appearing in the late 18th century, the defence ministers were often called "Ministers of War", and were in charge of the land forces of a nation.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]  Since the end of World War II, the title has changed from war to defence, and has often involved putting a single defence minister in charge of all the armed forces.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]  Another common reform which occurred at the end of World War II was to place the defence minister in a national security council or a "Kitchen Cabinet", which allows the head of government or head of state to coordinate military, diplomatic and economic activities.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The Defence Ministry in some countries is a very important ministry, sometimes considered more important than the foreign ministry. If war is common for a country, the minister's position is often assumed by the Prime Minister. (For example, five Prime Ministers of Israel have held the Defence (Security) Ministry during their Premiership).  In many nations it is a strong convention that the defence minister be a civilian, in order to highlight civilian control over the military. In less democratic countries, the minister is often an active military official; in several countries the minister also holds the position of Commander of the Armed Forces.

Sati (Devanagari: सती, the feminine of sat "true"; also called suttee)[tpl]ref|spelling[/tpl] refers to a funeral practice within some Asian communities in which a recently widowed woman immolates herself, typically on her husband's funeral pyre.
Without explicit ethical support, but, instead, wholly lacking evidential recognition of the rite's existence from the ancient Vedic Age (c. 1750–500 BCE), literary evidence about the practice appears from the 4th century BCE, while archaeological evidence only appears from the 5th and 6th centuries CE. Initially, the evidence points to an origin of the practice within the warrior aristocracy on the Indian subcontinent, gradually gaining in popularity from the 10th century CE to other groups, becoming generally sanctioned/recommended by theological doctrine around the 12th century CE. With the military expansions outside of Indian subcontinent, the practice has been attested to have been practiced in a number of localities in Southeast Asia, such as at Bali in present-day Indonesia.
The practice was outlawed by the British Raj in 1829 within their own territories in India (the collected statistics from their own regions suggesting typically some 500–600 instances of sati per year), followed up by laws in the same directions by the authorities in the princely states of India in the ensuing decades, with a general ban for the whole of India issued by Queen Victoria in 1861. In Nepal, sati was not abolished as legalized practice until 1920. Never having been more than a fairly rare custom in India or other countries, the custom is still today occasionally adhered to, despite a 150 year old ban. One example is a recent case from India in 2008, when 75-year-old Lalmati Verma allegedly jumped onto her husband's funeral pyre. The Indian Sati Prevention Act from 1987 makes it criminal to aiding, abetting, and even only "glorifying" the act of sati, placing upon those who could prevent the act a legal duty to prevent it from happening.

CATEGORIES: Debating

Debate is contention in argument; dispute, controversy; discussion; especially the discussion of questions of public interest in Parliament or in any assembly.The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., [tpl]page needed|date=May 2012[/tpl].
Debate is a method of interactive and representational argument. Debate is a broader form of argument than deductive reasoning, which only examines whether a conclusion is a consequence of premises, and factual argument, which only examines what is or isn't the case, or rhetoric, which is a technique of persuasion. Though logical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are important elements of the art of persuasion, in debating, one side often prevails over the other side by presenting a superior "context" and/or framework of the issue, which is far more subtle and strategic. The outcome of a debate depends upon consensus or some formal way of reaching a resolution, rather than the objective facts as such.
In a formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will interact.
Debating is commonly carried out in many assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by a vote. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leaders debates and the U.S. presidential election debates, are sometimes held in democracies.
Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments. The major goal of the study of debate as a method or art is to develop the ability to debate rationally from either position with equal ease.
Although informal debate is common the quality and depth of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters. The outcome of a contest may be decided by audience vote, by judges, or by some combination of the two.

The question of how, when, where and why humans first entered the Americas is of intense interest to archaeologists and anthropologists, and has been a subject of heated debate for centuries. Several models for the Paleo-Indian settlement of America have been proposed by various academic communities. Modern biochemical techniques, as well as more thorough archaeology, have shed progressively more light on the subject.
Current understanding of human migration to and throughout the Americas derives from advances in four interrelated disciplines: archeology, physical anthropology, DNA analysis and linguistics. While there is general agreement that America was first settled from Asia by people who migrated across Beringia, the pattern of migration, its timing, and the place of origin in Asia of the peoples who migrated to America remains unclear.[tpl]cite news|title=Pause Is Seen in a Continent’s Peopling|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/science/linguistic-study-sheds-new-light-on-peopling-of-north-america.html?ref=science|date=13 Mar 2014[/tpl]

Ace of Wands is a fantasy-based British children's television show broadcast on ITV between 1970 and 1972, created by Trevor Preston and Pamela Lonsdale and produced by Thames Television. The title, taken from the name of a Tarot card describes the principal character, called "Tarot" (played by Michael MacKenzie) who combined stage magic with supernatural powers. Tarot has a pet Owl named Ozymandias, played by Fred Owl.[tpl]r|BFI[/tpl] The series was later replaced by The Tomorrow People in 1973.
Ace of Wands ran for two seasons of thirteen episodes and a third season of twenty. Many, if not all, of the first 26 episodes are believed to have been wiped, although the final season is intact. In the first two series Tarot is assisted by Sam Maxstead (Tony Selby), a reformed convict and Lillian Palmer known by her nickname, Lulli (Judy Loe), an orphan. Lulli shares a telepathic link with Tarot, which enables them to communicate over great distances.  After having to leave the programme because of prior commitments, in the final series this pair were replaced by brother and sister Chas (Roy Holder), a photographer, and Mikki (Petra Markham), a female journalist, who have very similar roles, she also sharing a telepathic link with Tarot. A character named Mr Sweet (Donald Layne-Smith) who runs an antiquarian bookshop often has the answer to Tarot's questions. Sweet is based in a university for the last series. Mr. Stabs, played by Russell Hunter, is defeated by Ace of Wands's lead Tarot, yet returns, again played by Hunter, in an episode of the anthology series Shadows. The character's final appearance was in Dramarama, this time portrayed by David Jason. However, the Dramarama story was a prequel to the previous ones.
A DVD of all existing episodes was released by Network UK in July 2007 and features a new documentary in 3 parts by Classic TV enthusiasts and experts Andrew Pixley and Simon Coward.
The theme music, "Tarot" was written and performed by Andy Bown (now with Status Quo). It was available at the time as a single.[tpl]r|BFI[/tpl]

Organized in 1951 as the Interstate and Foreign Missionary Baptist Associational Assembly of America, this group is now known as the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association of America. Their purpose is to encourage fellowship among Missionary Baptist churches that practice ministerial support by freewill offerings. Since they do not believe in stipulated salaries for pastors and missionaries, they are also known as "Faithway Baptists".
Churches of this association originally fellowshipped with the American Baptist Association. A split in the American Baptist Association (organized 1924) resulted in the formation of two new national associations - the Baptist Missionary Association of America (then called North American Baptist Association) and the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association. All three of these associations adhere to the Landmark principle of a succession of Baptist churches from the time of Christ to the present.
Doctrinally, the churches of the Interstate and Foreign Landmark Missionary Baptist Association hold that Christ died for all men; salvation is by grace through faith; the saved are eternally secure; the church is local only and was organized by Christ while He was on earth; baptism by immersion and the Lord's supper are church ordinances; feet washing is to be performed in church capacity; ministerial support must be by freewill offerings; and the Great Commission is given to local churches only.
The association work consists of local churches recommending their missionaries to other churches.  All decisions to support missionaries are made by the churches in their own business meetings. Local churches sponsor and directly support all missionary, benevolent, and educational work.
In 1951, forty churches were represented at the organization. In 2000, there were 135 churches in the association, with a membership of 14,945. Some fellowshipping churches represent in local and state associations but not in the general association. The total number of Faithway Baptist churches meeting in associations is 168 with over 30,000 members. Most of the churches are concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; but there are even churches in Mexico, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Quebec, Canada, and South Korea. Twelve foreign, six interstate, and two radio missionaries were recommended by their churches (2000). A paper, "The Voice of Faith", is published by the Pine Missionary Baptist Church, Franklinton, Louisiana. Faith Way Sunday School Literature is printed by Palestine Missionary Baptist Church of Wilmer, Alabama.

Sacred Harp singing (also "Shape-note singing" or, of the repertory, "Shape-note hymnody") is a tradition of sacred choral music that flourished in the American South of the United States. The name is derived from The Sacred Harp, a ubiquitous and historically important book of Sacred Harp music.
The tradition has its roots in a distinctive American style of music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in New England, with a significant, related development under the influence of "revival" services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the shape note style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.David Warren Steel, "Shape-note hymnody," in Grove Music Online (Oxford UP: article updated 16 October 2013) Subscription Required
Sacred Harp music is performed a cappella (voice only, without instruments) and originated as Protestant Christian music.

[[List of California ballot propositions]]

CATEGORIES: California ballot propositions, California politics-related lists, United States law-related lists, Lists of referendums

The following is a list of California ballot propositions broken down by decade.  Propositions can be placed on the ballot either through the initiative process or by a vote of the state legislature. Propositions were added to the California constitution as part of the ethics reform instituted by Governor Hiram Johnson in the early 1910s.
Prior to the November 1982 general election, proposition numbers started with "1" for each election.  After November 1982, subsequent propositions received higher and higher numbers until November 1998 when the count was reset.  Starting with November 1998, the count is reset in 10-year cycles.
In October 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill which requires all future ballot propositions to be listed only in general elections (held in November), rather than during any statewide election. Two propositions had already qualified for the next statewide election (which was the June 2012 presidential primaries) prior to the signing of the law, making the June 2012 primaries the last state-wide non-general elections in California to have statewide propositions on the ballot.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/08/3968832/gov-jerry-brown-signs-bill-restricting.html|title=Gov.

Philip Francis Little (1824 – October 21, 1897) was the first Premier of Newfoundland Colony between 1855 and 1858. He was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Little studied law there with Charles Young and was admitted to the bar in 1844. He came to Newfoundland in 1846 and articled in law. He got involved in politics only a few years after. He helped lead the charge for responsible government along with John Kent. After it was granted in 1854, he went on to run a successful campaign as leader of the predominantly Roman Catholic Liberal Party. He became Newfoundland's first Premier in 1855 and served concurrently as the colony's Attorney-General.
Little only remained in office until July 15, 1858,http://data2.archives.ca/pdf/pdf001/p000001197.pdf when he resigned to be succeeded by John Kent. In that time, he managed to secure Newfoundland's autonomy, in making sure Newfoundland had a say over its own destiny. Then Britain and France came with a plan involving the west coast of Newfoundland.[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2008[/tpl] Little objected and in a dispatch in 1857, the British cancelled the deal which would have been unfavourable to Newfoundland.
He resigned in 1858 saying "I go now before the milk of Human kindness goes sour for me". He was right in that Newfoundland was about to enter an era of sectarian strife. Little was appointed as appointed assistant justice on the Supreme Court of Newfoundland in September 1858 and became Chief Justice two months later. In 1861, riots broke out over disputed election results from Harbour Grace. Little, as Chief Justice, played a prominent role in dispersing and calming the crowds. He married into a wealthy Anglo-Irish family in 1864 and retired to Ireland in 1868 and did a great deal for the home rule movement there. He died at the age of 73 in 1897 while living in Monkstown, Ireland.
He married Mary Jane Holdright in 1864 and they had 13 children. Their youngest child Patrick Little was a senior Irish politician.

[[Nuclear weapons testing]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear weapons, Nuclear weapons testing

Nuclear weapons tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness, yield, and explosive capability of nuclear weapons. Throughout the 20th century, most nations that developed nuclear weapons tested them. Testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work, as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how structures behave when subjected to nuclear explosions. Nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength, and many tests have been overtly political in their intention; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test.
The first nuclear weapon was detonated as a test by the United States at the Trinity site on July 16, 1945, with a yield approximately equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. The first hydrogen bomb, codenamed "Mike", was tested at the Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, 1952 (local date), also by the United States. The largest nuclear weapon ever tested was the "Tsar Bomba" of the Soviet Union at Novaya Zemlya on October 30, 1961, with the largest yield ever seen ([tpl]As of|2013|12|lc=y[/tpl]), an estimated 50–58 megatons.
In 1963, three (UK, US, Soviet Union) of the four nuclear states and many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted underground nuclear testing. France continued atmospheric testing until 1974, and China continued until 1980. Neither has signed the treaty."The Treaty has not been signed by France or by the Peoples Republic of China." U.S. Department of State, Limited Test Ban Treaty.
Underground tests in the United States continued until 1992 (its last nuclear test), the Soviet Union until 1990, the United Kingdom until 1991, and both China and France until 1996. In signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, these states have pledged to discontinue all nuclear testing. However, [tpl]As of|2013|12|lc=y[/tpl], the treaty has not yet entered into force because of failure to be signed/ratified by eight specific countries. Non-signatories India and Pakistan last tested nuclear weapons in 1998.
The most recent nuclear test [tpl]As of|2013|2|alt=occurred[/tpl] in February 2013 in North Korea. In January 2013, North Korea had announced that it planned to conduct further tests involving rockets that can carry satellites as well as nuclear warheads "to strike and attack the United States".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/01/24/after-un-acts-nkorea-vows-to-beef-up-nukes | title=N.

CATEGORIES: National Wildlife Refuges in Arkansas, Protected areas of Pope County, Arkansas, Protected areas of Yell County, Arkansas

Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge is a 6,486 acre (26 km²) wildlife refuge located 5 miles southeast of Dardanelle, Arkansas.
The Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge is bounded on one side by the Arkansas River and on its other sides by an oxbow lake that was formerly the main channel of the Arkansas. The oxbow lake was formed in 1954 by the Army Corps of Engineers during their efforts to straighten the Arkansas River navigation channel. The island that was formed by this project between the old and new channels was transferred to the US Department of the Interior in 1957 for use as a wildlife refuge. The land was formerly agricultural land but was abandoned after the 1927 flood.
The primary function of this refuge is to provide a winter home for ducks and geese that migrate from the north along the Mississippi Flyway each year. Up to 100,000 of these fowl live in the refuge during the winter months.US Fish and Wildlife Service-Holla Bend NWR accessed 13 March 2009

[[Sube a mi Motora]]
CATEGORIES: Menudo songs, 1981 songs

Sube a mi Motora is the name of a Menudo song from their 1981 album Quiero Ser. It became arguably the album's most popular song, topping the charts in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Venezuela. It is considered by many Menudo fans to have been the group's best song ever. Rene Farrait was the lead singer for this song.
Sube a mi Motora (Motorcycle Dreamer in English) created some controversy in Mexico, because in Mexico, moto usually is the term used for illegal drugs. Because of that, the song's name had to be changed for the Mexican audience, who knew the song as Subete a mi Moto. The Mexican version also became known across Latin America, and was used in Menudo's 1983 movie, Una Aventura Llamada Menudo,  where Farrait's substitute, Charlie Masso, sang it.
Sube a mi Motora was usually the last song performed at Menudo concerts during the era that the song was a hit. When six members of Menudo returned to the stage in 1998 during their El Reencuentro comeback tour, Sube a mi Motora was always the last song performed by the former Menudo's and Farrait ended the shows by driving a motorcycle around.
In the mid-80s, the song was released in Portuguese (Suba na minha Moto) and it was a big hit there, but the biggest hit of the group in the country was Não Se Reprima.

(Palo Alto: Mayfield) 1985; André Pelletier, SJ, La Lettre d'Aristée à Philocrate (Paris) 1962. JosephusAntiquities XII:ii passim (Online in Greek and English at York University) who paraphrases about two-fifths of the letter, ascribes it to Aristeas and to have been written to a certain Philocrates, describing the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law by seventy-two interpreters sent into Egypt from Jerusalem at the request of the librarian of Alexandria, resulting in the Septuagint translation. Though some have argued that its story of the creation of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is fictitious,The narrative is "open to the gravest suspicion, and the letter abounds with improbabilities and is now generally regarded as more or less fabulous," observed The Classical Review 335/6 (August–September 1919:123), reporting H.

CATEGORIES: 1805 births, 1872 deaths, Irish emigrants to Newfoundland, Canadian Roman Catholics, Newfoundland colonial leaders, Politicians from County Wexford, Speakers of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly

Kent was born in Wexford, Ireland in 1805, arrived in Newfoundland in 1820 and started working for his uncle Patrick Morris. He was influential in establishing a large Irish population on the island. He was elected to the first House of Assembly in 1832 as a Liberal. John Kent was a champion of Catholic rights on an island that was deeply divided along religious lines. He worked for the reform movement along with William Carson and Morris that successfully persuaded the British Colonial Office to institute responsible government in Newfoundland. Kent became Colonial Secretary under Philip Francis Little. 
From 1848 to 1855 he was Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly.
He became Premier after Little resigned in 1858. He won the election of 1859 but his government was engulfed by crisis in  1861 when it tried to lower the salary of (mostly Protestant) government officials, including judges who sued the government. In the legislature Kent accused Governor  Sir Alexander Bannerman and the opposition Conservatives of conspiring with the judges against the government. Bannerman responded by dismissing the Kent's government in March 1861 and installing Hugh Hoyles as Premier of a Conservative government.http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=5074 
The Liberals defeated the Conservative government in a Motion of No Confidence resulting in an election campaign that was fought along sectarian lines with Catholics largely voting Liberal and Protestants largely voting Conservative. The Protestant Conservative Party of Newfoundland narrowly defeated Kent's Liberals and riots erupted in Catholic Harbour Grace when the governor cancelled voting there essentially denying the Liberals two seats in the legislature and allowing the Conservatives to have a legislative majority. 
Kent later joined Sir Frederick Carter's coalition government that attempted to heal the rifts and create a cross denominational compromise that allowed power sharing between Catholics and Protestants, the funding of all denominational schools and the creation of political parties that included members of all denominations.

[[Velvet Scoter]]
CATEGORIES: Melanitta, Birds of Europe, Birds of Turkey, Birds of Iran, Birds of Lithuania, British Isles coastal fauna, Animals described in 1758

The Velvet Scoter (Melanitta fusca), also called a Velvet DuckBuczacki, Stefan (2005) Fauna Britannica, Hamlyn, London. or whitewing[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] (not to be confused with the White-winged Scoter), is a large sea duck, which breeds over the far north of Europe and Asia west of the Yenisey basin. A small, isolated population nests in eastern Turkey. The East Siberian and North American White-winged Scoter is sometimes considered conspecific with the Velvet Scoter, and its two constituent subspecies are then known as M. f. stejnegeri and M. f. deglandi. Velvet and White-winged Scoter, along with the Surf Scoter, are placed in the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, Black and Common Scoters.
It winters  further south in temperate zones, Europe as far south as Great Britain, and on the Black and Caspian Sea. Small numbers reach France and northern Spain. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together.
The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra, and typically contains 7–9 eggs. This duck dives for crustaceans and molluscs.
It is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. It is the largest scoter at 51–58 cm. The male is all black, except for white around the eye and a white speculum. It has a bulbous yellow bill with a black base. The females are brown birds with two pale patches on each side of the head and white wing patches.
The Velvet Scoter is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

CATEGORIES: 19th-century fashion, 20th-century fashion, Formalwear, History of clothing (Western fashion), History of fashion

White tie (or full dress, evening dress, full evening dress; slang top hat and tails or white tie and tails, tailsuit, tails) is the most formal evening dress code in Western fashion. It is worn to ceremonial occasions such as state dinners in some countries, as well as to very formal balls and evening weddings.  The chief components for men are the black dress coat commonly known as an evening tailcoat, white bow tie, white waistcoat and starched wing collar shirt, while women wear a suitable dress for the occasion, such as a ball gown.
As evening dress, white tie is traditionally considered correct only after 6:00 p.m. although some etiquette authorities allow for it any time after dark even if that means prior to 6:00 p.m. (though there are some exceptions).  The equivalent formal attire for daytime events is called morning dress. The semi-formal evening counterpart of white tie is black tie.

[[Scoter]]

CATEGORIES: Melanitta, Bird genera, Ducks

The scoters are stocky seaducks in the genus Melanitta. The drakes are mostly black and have swollen bills. Females are brown.
They breed in the far north of Europe, Asia and North America, and winter  further south in temperate zones of those continents. They form large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together.
Their lined nests are built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. These species dive for crustaceans and molluscs.
There are five species, grouped into two subgenera:
The presumed fossil "scoter" Melanitta ceruttii which lived in California during the Late Pliocene is now placed in the genus Histrionicus.

[[The Floating Admiral]]
CATEGORIES: 1931 novels, Mystery novels, Collaborative fiction, Hodder & Stoughton books

The Floating Admiral is a collaborative detective novel written by fourteen members of the Detection Club in 1931.  The twelve chapters of the story were each written by a different author, in the following sequence: Canon Victor Whitechurch, G. D. H. Cole and Margaret Cole, Henry Wade, Agatha Christie, John Rhode, Milward Kennedy,  Dorothy L. Sayers, Ronald Knox, Freeman Wills Crofts, Edgar Jepson, Clemence Dane and Anthony Berkeley. G. K. Chesterton contributed a Prologue, which was written after the novel had been completed.Charles Osborne, The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie, London, 1982. 
In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book.
As Sayers explained in the introduction to the book, "Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view—that is, he must not introduce new complications merely 'to make it more difficult' ... Each writer was bound to deal faithfully with all the difficulties left for his consideration by his predecessors."

[[Surf Scoter]]

CATEGORIES: Melanitta, Ducks, Merginae, Birds of Canada, Birds of the Sea of Cortez

The Surf Scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) is a large sea duck, which breeds in Canada and Alaska. It is placed in the subgenus Melanitta, along with the Velvet and White-winged Scoters, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, Black and Common Scoters.
It winters further south in temperate zones, on the coasts of the northern United States. Small numbers regularly winter in western Europe as far south as the British Isles. Some birds may over-winter on the Great Lakes. It forms large flocks on suitable coastal waters. These are tightly packed, and the birds tend to take off together.
The lined nest is built on the ground close to the sea, lakes or rivers, in woodland or tundra. 5–9 eggs are laid. An egg may range from [tpl]convert|55|-|79|g|oz|abbr=on[/tpl] and average [tpl]convert|43.9|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in breadth and [tpl]convert|62.4|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Occasional (and likely accidental) brood mixing between different females occurs in areas with high densities of nests. Growth is relatively rapid and the incubation period is about 28 to 30 days. The offspring will fledge independently at about 55 days.
The adult female averages about [tpl]convert|900|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|44|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, while the adult male is on average [tpl]convert|1050|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, making this the smallest species of scoter on average. It is characterised by its bulky shape and large bill. The male is all black, except for white patches on the nape and forehead. It has a bulbous red, yellow and white bill. The females are brown birds with pale head patches. The wedge-shaped head and lack of white in the wings helps to distinguish female Surf Scoters from female Velvet Scoters.
Adult scoters of this species dive for crustaceans and molluscs, while the ducklings live off any variety of freshwater invertebrates.
In November, 2007, an oil spill in San Francisco harbour oiled and killed thousands of birds including many Surf Scoters. About 40% of the birds affected were from this species. Scientists said that while the species is not endangered it has declined 50 to 70% over the past 40 years and this spill could decrease populations since most of the affected birds are healthy adults.San Fran oil spill hurts Canadian sea duck population.

[[Lap dance]]
CATEGORIES: Erotic dance, Dances

A lap dance is a type of erotic dance performance offered in some strip clubs either in immediate contact (contact dancing) with a seated patron or within a very short distance of a seated patron, which is sometimes called a table dance. The dancer may be nude, topless or scantily dressed, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and the club's policies. With full-contact lap dances, the stripper may engage in non-penetrative sexual contact with the patron, such as "grinding" his or her body against the patron. Variant terms include couch dance, which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch, and bed dance where the customer lies down on a bed. In some places, a "block session" of lap dances (usually a half an hour to an hour) can be booked in a "champagne room", which is a private room usually located in the back of a club. In many clubs, the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club's DJ. Charges for lap dances vary significantly.
Depending on the local jurisdiction and community standards, lap dances can involve touching of the dancer by the patron, touching the patron by the dancer, neither, or both. In some clubs, any touching by the patron is forbidden. On the other hand, absent any oversight by the club, various levels of contact may be negotiable between the participants. Clubs vary widely with regard to whether they enforce their rules or turn a blind eye to any violations.
There is some debate as to whether lap dancing is entertainment or a type of sex work.Einat Albin. The Case of Quashie: Between the Legalisation of Sex Work and the Precariousness of Personal Service Work. Industrial Law Journal. (2013) 42 (2): 180-191. doi: 10.1093/indlaw/dwt006 Available online at: http://m.ilj.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/180.short?rss=1. Accessed on March 12, 2014. Critics of lap dancing allege that some club owners, by installing dark private booths and charging dancers steep stage fees, are covertly condoning and encouraging the sale of sexual acts between customers and dancers. This can be a concern if, as for instance in the United Kingdom, the club has a Public Entertainment Licence rather than a Sex Establishment Licence, and in jurisdictions where brothels are illegal.Bindel, Julie.

CATEGORIES: Food retailing, Food markets, Rural community development, Farmers' markets

A farmers' market (also farmers market) is a physical retail market featuring foods sold directly by farmers to consumers. Farmers' markets typically consist of booths, tables or stands, outdoors or indoors, where farmers sell fruits, vegetables, meats, and sometimes prepared foods and beverages. They are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/public_markets_differ_from_farmers_markets|title=Public markets differ from farmers markets|publisher=MIchigan State University[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.7thstreetpublicmarket.com/2012/the-difference-between-public-markets-and-farmers-markets/|publisher=7th street public market, Charlotte NC USA|title=The Difference Between Public Markets and Farmers Markets[/tpl]
Farmers' markets exist worldwide and reflect their local culture and economy. Their size ranges from a few stalls to several city blocks. In some cultures, live animals, imported delicacies unavailable locally, and personal goods and crafts are sold.

Academic dress is a traditional form of clothing for academic settings, primarily tertiary (and sometimes secondary) education, worn mainly by those who have been admitted to a university degree (or similar), or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities).Shaw (1995), p. 3 It is also known as academicals and, in the United States, as academic regalia.
Contemporarily, it is commonly seen only at graduation ceremonies, but formerly academic dress was, and to a lesser degree in many ancient universities still is, worn daily. Today the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consists of a gown (also known as a robe) with a separate hood, and usually a cap (generally either a square academic cap, a tam, or a bonnet). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain learned societies and institutions as official dress.e.g. Burgon Society: Robes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |title=History and Archives of the American College of Surgeons; Highlight of the Month October 10, 2005; The Clinical Congress: Then and Now, accessed 01/29/2008 |publisher=Facs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28[/tpl]

Martín Vargas Fuentes (born January 24, 1955 in Osorno) is a former boxer from Chile, who represented his native country at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany.Olympic results He attempted to obtain Chile's first boxing world title four times. Although he failed, this fact helped him become a national idol in Chile.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
On March 23, 1973, Vargas made his professional debut, beating Martín Muñoz by a decision in six rounds. He won twelve fights in a row before drawing (tying) with Nelson Muñoz on December 13, 1973. In 1974, he tasted defeat for the first time when he was knocked out in seven rounds by Alfredo Alcayaga. On October 11 of that same year, he and Alcayaga had a rematch, this time with the Chilean national flyweight title at stake. Vargas avenged his first defeat with a seven-round knockout win. One month later, he had his first fight abroad, a ten round draw with Carlos Escalante in Buenos Aires.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
After fourteen wins in a row, Vargas had a chance to add the South American regional belt to his resume, and he did so by knocking out Gonzalo Cruz in round one on December 20, 1975 in Santiago. He defended that title twice, and after beating Carlos Escalante in their Uruguay rematch, Vargas' win streak reached 27 wins in a row.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
On September 17, 1977, he fought for the world title for the first time; World Boxing Council world flyweight champion Miguel Canto defeated Vargas by a fifteen-round decision in Yucatán, Mexico. Vargas had one more win: two months after their first fight, Vargas once again challenged Canto, this time in Santiago. Canto broke the hearts of most Vargas fans on November 30, 1977 by defeating the hometown favorite, again by a fifteen-round decision.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
On April 22 of 1978, Vargas beat future world champion Alfonso López of Panama by a knockout in round one to defend his South American title with success. On November 4 of that year, he challenged World Boxing Association (WBA) world champion Betulio González in the champion's hometown of Maracay, Venezuela, but González retained the crown with a twelfth-round knockout victory. This defeat was followed by thirteen wins in a row, including points wins over future world champions Joey Olivo and Rafael Pedroza (cousin of Eusebio Pedroza). Vargas then traveled to Japan, where on June 1 he lost by a knockout in round eight what turned out to be his last world title bid to WBA world Junior flyweight champion Yoko Gushiken.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
After the Gushiken fight, Vargas had a rather ordinary record of 21 wins and 7 losses before retiring for the first time in 1987. He did, however, add another regional title to his trophy case when he beat Delis Rojas on July 23, 1982 by a decision in twelve rounds in Miami, to earn the WBC's continental Americas' flyweight title.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
Having retired, Vargas' legend continued to grow among Chileans, many of whom spoke of the many times Vargas seemed to be close to become Chile's first world boxing champion. He is still seen by many as the best boxer ever to come out of that country, and as a national hero of Chile.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 1997, ten years after his original retirement, Vargas attempted a comeback. His first fight back was videotaped by a crew making a documentary film about him, and he defeated Gerónimo Rojas by a knockout in round two on July 4. On February 7, 1998, he added the Chilean Super Flyweight title to his collection of regional titles with a first round knockout over José Carmona. One month later, he beat Juan Lielmil, also by knockout in round one, to regain the Chilean flyweight title. But after losing to Joel García, by knockout in round one on July 31 of that same year, he decided to retire permanently.

Proposition 13 (officially named the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation) was an amendment of the Constitution of California enacted during 1978, by means of the initiative process. It was approved by California voters on June 6, 1978. It was declared constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Nordlinger v. Hahn, [tpl]ussc|505|1|1992[/tpl]. Proposition 13 is embodied in Article 13A of the Constitution of the State of California.Full text of Article 13A
The most significant portion of the act is the first paragraph, which limited the tax rate for real estate:[tpl]Bquote|Section 1. (a) The maximum amount of any ad valorem tax on real property shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the full cash value of such property. The one percent (1%) tax to be collected by the counties and apportioned according to law to the districts within the counties.[/tpl]
The proposition decreased property taxes by assessing property values at their 1975 value and restricted annual increases of assessed value of real property to an inflation factor, not to exceed 2% per year. It also prohibited reassessment of a new base year value except for in cases of (a) change in ownership, or (b) completion of new construction.
In addition to decreasing property taxes, the initiative also contained language requiring a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases of any state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates. It also requires a two-thirds vote majority in local elections for local governments wishing to increase special taxes. Proposition 13 received an enormous amount of publicity, not only in California, but throughout the United States.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/realestate/07california.html?ex=1182830400&en=3831f57bb981c487&ei=5070m|title= The Least Affordable Place to Live? Try Salinas|publisher= New York Times | first=Alina | last=Tugend | date=May 7, 2006 | accessdate=April 28, 2010[/tpl]
Passage of the initiative presaged a "taxpayer revolt" throughout the country that is sometimes thought to have contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency during 1980.  However, of 30 anti-tax ballot measures that year, only 13 measures passed.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3491516.html|title= Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Initiative?|publisher= Hoover Institute[/tpl]
A large contributor to Proposition 13 was the sentiment that older Californians should not be priced out of their homes through high taxes.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.caltax.org/MEMBER/digest/feb2000/feb00-4.htm|title= Senator Peace: Cure Prop. 13 'Sickness' by Reassessing Commercial Property, Boosting the Homeowners' Exemption and Cutting the Sales Tax|publisher= Cal Tax Digest[/tpl]  The proposition has been called the "third rail" (meaning "untouchable subject") of California politics, and it is not popular politically for lawmakers to attempt to change it.

The Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) is a large New World sparrow. The taxonomy of the towhees has been debated in recent decades, and formerly this bird and the Eastern Towhee were considered a single species, the Rufous-sided Towhee. An archaic name for the Spotted Towhee is the Oregon Towhee (Pipilo maculatus oregonus).
The form that breeds on Socorro Island is much smaller than other rufous-sided towhees, and has grey upperparts. It is sometimes split as the Socorro Towhee (Pipilo socorroensis).

Examples of characters included in Unicode (ITC Zapf Dingbats series 100 and others):
The advent of Unicode and the universal character set it provides allowed commonly used dingbats to be given their own character codes, from 2700 to 27BF (hexadecimal). Although fonts claiming Unicode coverage will contain glyphs for dingbats in addition to alphabetic characters, fonts that have dingbats in place of alphabetic characters continue to be popular, primarily for ease of input.  Such fonts are also sometimes known as pi fonts.https://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/PiFontInfo.pdf

Newport ([tpl]lang-cy|Casnewydd[/tpl]) is a cathedral and university city and unitary authority in south east Wales.  It is located on the River Usk close to its confluence with the Severn estuary, approximately [tpl]convert|11|mi|km|0[/tpl] east of Cardiff.  As of the 2011 census it is the third largest city in Wales, with a city population of 145,736, and an urban population of 306,844. The city forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area with a population of 1,097,000.
Newport has been a port since medieval times, when a castle was built by the Normans.  The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon, immediately upstream, and gained its first charter in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century, when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern valleys of South Wales.  Until the rise of Cardiff from the 1850s, Newport was Wales' largest coal-exporting port.  It was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Britain, the Newport Rising of 1839 led by the Chartists.
During the 20th century, the docks declined in importance, but Newport remained an important manufacturing and engineering centre.  It was granted city status in 2002. Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010. It has been announced the city will play host to the 2014 NATO summit.
It is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The City of Newport, which includes some surrounding rural areas as well as the built up area, is governed by Newport City Council.

[[Council-controlled organisation]]

CATEGORIES: Government-owned companies of New Zealand

Council-controlled organisations and council-controlled trading organisations in New Zealand are what were formerly known as local authority trading enterprises (LATEs). Introduced under Sections 6 and 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, they are essentially any company with a majority council shareholding, or a trust or similar organisation with a majority of council-controlled votes or council-appointed trustees, unless designated otherwise. More than one council may be represented in a council-controlled organisation.
They are used for widely varying purposes by councils. For example, the Wellington City Council uses trusts to hold museums and its zoo, while in 1996 the Horowhenua District Council transferred its library functions to the Horowhenua Library Trust.[tpl]cite web|title=Horowhenua Library Trust - Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.library.org.nz/who/hlt/faq.html|accessdate=30 January 2011[/tpl] 
In the past, the erstwhile for-profit LATEs were seen as the local government equivalent of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Many of these, which included bus companies, diagnostic laboratories, public works divisions and property investment companies, were privatised. For-profit council organisations are now termed council-controlled trading organisations under the Act. Council-controlled organisations pay tax to central government, unlike the internal activities of councils which are tax-free.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10633963&pnum=0 |title=Council reveals Super City's hidden tax bill |last1=Orsman |first1=Bernard |date=24 March 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=24 March 2010[/tpl]

[[Engine turnings]]
CATEGORIES: Visual motifs

Engine turning refers to a fine geometric pattern that can be inscribed onto metal as a finish.  Aluminium is often the metal chosen but any metal can be finely machined to produce intricate repetitive patterns that offer reflective interest and fine detail.
Perhaps the most recognizable example of engine turning is the engine cowling (nose) of Charles Lindbergh's aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis. In the 1920s and '30s, automobile parts such as valve covers, which are right on top of the engine, were also engine-turned. Similarly, dashboards or the instrument panel of the same were often engine-turned. Customizers also would decorate their vehicles with engine-turned panels similarly. Recently, one firm engine-turns the faces of its automobile instruments for customizers who don't want to have to turn a panel themselves.
Engravings produced by engine turning are often incorporated into the design of bank notes and other high value documents to make production of forged copies difficult. The resulting graphics are called guillochés.
The sheet metal parts of the World War I Fokker Eindecker fighter aircraft series, especially around the engine cowl and associated sheetmetal, are noted for having a "dragged" form of engine turning entirely covering them.  The tool creating the "swirls" was repeatedly moved along a short irregular path each time while pressed against the metal, to create the intricate appearance that was characteristic of the aircraft's sheet metal parts, and is partly surmised to have been a mechanical method to "clad" a duralumin sheet metal panel with pure aluminum with a disc of pure aluminum in the tool, for corrosion protection.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/camouflage-markings/33076-fokker-engine-turned-cowls.html |title=Fokker Engine-Turned Cowls |author= |date=started on October 22, 2007 |website=theaerodrome.com |publisher=theaerodrome.com |accessdate=October 10, 2013[/tpl]

[[Irish poetry]]
CATEGORIES: Irish literature, Irish poems

Irish poetry includes poetry in two languages, Irish and English. The complex interplay between these two traditions, and between both of them and other poetries in English, has produced a body of work that is both rich in variety and difficult to categorise.
The earliest surviving poems in Irish date back to the 6th century, while the first known poems in English from Ireland date to the 14th century. Although there has always been some cross-fertilization between the two language traditions, an English-language poetry that had absorbed themes and models from Irish did not finally emerge until the 19th century. This culminated in the work of the poets of the Irish Literary Revival in the late 19th and early 20th century.
Towards the last quarter of the 20th century, modern Irish poetry tended to a wide range of diversity, from the poets of the Northern school to writers influenced by the modernist tradition and those facing the new questions posed by an increasingly urban and cosmopolitan society.

[[Plateau's problem]]
CATEGORIES: Calculus of variations, Minimal surfaces, Mathematical problems, Belgian inventions

In mathematics, Plateau's problem is to show the existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary, a problem raised by  Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1760.  However, it is named after Joseph Plateau who experimented with soap films.  The problem is considered part of the calculus of variations.  The existence and regularity problems are part of geometric measure theory.
Various specialized forms of the problem were solved, but it was only in 1930 that general solutions were found in the context of mappings (immersions) independently by Jesse Douglas and Tibor Radó.  Their methods were quite different; Radó's work built on the previous work of René Garnier and held only for rectifiable simple closed curves, whereas Douglas used completely new ideas with his result holding for an arbitrary simple closed curve.  Both relied on setting up minimization problems; Douglas minimized the now-named Douglas integral while Radó minimized the "energy".  Douglas went on to be awarded the Fields Medal in 1936 for his efforts.
The extension of the problem to higher dimensions (that is, for k-dimensional surfaces in n-dimensional space) turns out to be much more difficult to study. Moreover, while the solutions to the original problem are always regular, it turns out that the solutions to the extended problem may have singularities if k ≤ n − 2. In the hypersurface case where k = n − 1, singularities occur only for n ≥ 8.
To solve the extended problem in special cases, the theory of perimeters (De Giorgi) for codimension 1 and the theory of rectifiable currents (Federer and Fleming) for higher codimension have been developed.
Physical soap films are more accurately modeled by the (M,0,delta)-minimal sets of Frederick Almgren, but the lack of a compactness theorem makes it difficult to prove the existence of an area minimizer. In this context, a persistent open question has been the existence of a least-area soap film. Ernst Robert Reifenberg solved such a "universal Plateau's problem" for boundaries which are homeomorphic to single embedded spheres. In his book Almgren claimed to use varifolds to solve the problem for more than one sphere, as well as more general boundaries, but his proof never appeared.  The "obvious proof" using Allard's compactness theorem for varifolds has a gap. The existence of a universal solution was established in 2012 by  Jenny Harrison of University of California, Berkeley using her theory of differential chains.  She used a novel definition of area, but it was not clear how this related to Hausdorff measure for solutions. Soap film regularity was not established in this paper. Recently, she and Harrison Pugh have announced existence and regularity of a solution to a universal Plateau's problem for codimension one surfaces using Hausdorff measure to define area. Their paper is currently under review.

[[Tube-dwelling spider]]

CATEGORIES: Segestriidae

The tube-dwelling spiders (family Segestriidae) consist of two large and widespread genera (Segestria and Ariadna) and one monotypic genus (Gippsicola from Australia). The family is easily recognized because its members have six eyes (most spiders have eight) arranged in a semicircle and have the first three pairs of legs arranged forward (most spiders have only the first two pairs so arranged.) The leg structure appears to be an adaptation for living in silken tubes, which unlike those of the atypical tarantulas, may branch and are often built in tree bark fissures, as well as under stones. These are haplogyne primitive araneomorphs related to the Dysderidae. Both Segestria and Ariadna are known from North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa and New Zealand, while Ariadna is also known from Australia. This wide distribution attests to the ancient origin of this family.

[[Null character]]

CATEGORIES: Control characters, Computer security exploits, Nothing

[tpl]Other uses|Null symbol (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Null symbol[/tpl]
The null character (also null terminator), abbreviated NUL, is a control character with the value zero.

It is present in many character sets, including ISO/IEC 646 (or ASCII), the C0 control code, the Universal Character Set (or Unicode), and EBCDIC.  It is available in nearly all mainstream programming languages."A byte with all bits set to 0, called the null character, shall exist in the basic execution character set; it is used to terminate a character string literal." — ANSI/ISO 9899:1990 (the ANSI C standard), section 5.2.1
The original meaning of this character was like NOP—when sent to a printer or a terminal, it does nothing (some terminals, however, incorrectly display it as space). When electromechanical teleprinters were used as computer output devices, one or more null characters were sent at the end of each printed line to allow time for the mechanism to return to the first printing position on the next line.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] On punched tape, the character is represented with no holes at all, so a new unpunched tape is initially filled with null characters, and often text could be "inserted" at a reserved space of null characters by punching the new characters into the tape over the nulls.
Today the character has much more significance in C and its derivatives and in many data formats, where it serves as a reserved character used to signify the end of a string,"A string is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null character" — ANSI/ISO 9899:1990 (the ANSI C standard), section 7.1.1 often called a null-terminated string.[tpl]citation|title=Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++|type=ISO 14882 standard working draft|date=28 February 2011|publisher=ISO/IEC|page=427|url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|format=PDF|id=N3242=11-0012|quote=A null-terminated byte string, or [tpl]smallcaps|ntbs[/tpl], is a character sequence whose highest-addressed element with deﬁned content has the value zero (the terminating null character); no other element in the sequence has the value zero.[/tpl] This allows the string to be any length with only the overhead of one byte; the alternative of storing a count requires either a string length limit of 255 or an overhead of more than one byte (there are other advantages/disadvantages described under null-terminated string).

[[Big Black]]

CATEGORIES: Big Black, Noise rock groups, American post-hardcore musical groups, Alternative rock groups from Illinois, Blast First artists, Homestead Records artists, Ruthless Records (Chicago) artists, Touch and Go Records artists

Big Black was an American punk rock band from Evanston, Illinois, active from 1981 to 1987. Founded by singer and guitarist Steve Albini, the band's initial lineup also included guitarist Santiago Durango and bassist Jeff Pezzati, both of Naked Raygun. In 1985 Pezzati was replaced by Dave Riley, who played on Big Black's two full-length studio albums, Atomizer (1986) and Songs About Fucking (1987).
Big Black's aggressive and abrasive music was characterized by distinctively clanky guitars and the use of a drum machine rather than a drum kit, elements which precursored industrial rock. The band acknowledged no taboos, and Albini's lyrics openly dealt with loaded topics including murder, rape, child sexual abuse, arson, racism, and misogyny. They also held staunch principles, shunning the mainstream music industry and insisting on complete control over all aspects of their career. Big Black booked their own tours, paid for their own recordings, and refused to sign contracts, eschewing many of the traditional corporate trappings of rock bands. In doing so they had a significant impact on the aesthetic development of independent and underground rock music.
In addition to two studio albums, Big Black released two live albums, two compilation albums, four EPs, and five singles, all through independent record labels. Most of the band's catalog was kept in print through Touch and Go Records for years following their breakup.

[[Null-terminated string]]

CATEGORIES: String data structures

In computer programming, a null-terminated string is a character string stored as an array containing the characters and terminated with a null character ('\0', called NUL in ASCII). Alternative names are C string, which refers to the C programming language and ASCIIZ (note that C strings do not imply the use of ASCII).
The length of a C string is found by searching for the (first) NUL byte. This can be slow as it takes O(n) (linear time) with respect to the string length. It also means that a NUL cannot be inside the string, as the only NUL is the one marking the end.

The common ion effect is responsible for the reduction in the solubility of an ionic precipitate when a soluble compound combining one of the ions of the precipitate is added to the solution in equilibrium with the precipitate. It states that if the concentration of any one of the ions is increased, then, according to Le Chatelier's principle, the ions in excess should combine with the oppositely charged ions. Some of the salt will be precipitated until the ionic product is equal to the solubility of the product. In simple words, common ion effect is defined as the suppression of the degree of dissociation of a weak electrolyte containing a common ion.[tpl]cite book|title=Chemistry for ISEET - Volume 1, Part A|year=2012|publisher=Varsity Education Management Limited|location=Hyderabad, India|author=Mannam Krishnamurthy|edition=2012|coauthors=Subba Rao Naidu|editor=Lokeswara Gupta|page=298|chapter=8[/tpl]

[[Hasse diagram]]

In order theory, a Hasse diagram ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|s|ə[/tpl]; German: [tpl]IPA|/ˈhasə/[/tpl]) is a type of mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the form of a drawing of its transitive reduction. Concretely, for a partially ordered set (S, ≤) one represents each element of S as a vertex in the plane and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y whenever y covers x (that is, whenever x < y and there is no z such that x < z < y). 
These curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order.
Hasse diagrams are named after Helmut Hasse (1898–1979); according to [tpl]harvtxt|Birkhoff|1948[/tpl], they are so-called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse was not the first to use these diagrams; they appear, e.g., in [tpl]harvtxt|Vogt|1895[/tpl]. Although Hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques.E.g., see [tpl]harvtxt|Di Battista|Tamassia|1988[/tpl] and [tpl]harvtxt|Freese|2004[/tpl].
The phrase "Hasse diagram" may also refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract directed acyclic graph, independently of any drawing of that graph, but this usage is eschewed here.

Dr. James Beaton (or Bethune) (1473–1539) was a Scottish church leader, the uncle of Dr. David Cardinal Beaton and the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland.
He was the sixth and youngest son of John Beaton of Balfour, in Fife. He graduated as Master of Arts at St. Andrews University in 1493, was appointed Precentor of Dornoch Cathedral (Diocese of Caithness) in 1497 and in 1503 was appointed Provost of the Collegiate Church of Bothwell. In 1504 he became Prior of Whithorn and Abbot of Dunfermline and in 1505 was made Lord High Treasurer of Scotland by James IV.
In 1508 he was elected as Bishop of Galloway, in succession to George Vaus, but before his consecration he was chosen to succeed Robert Blackadder as Archbishop of Glasgow and was consecrated at Stirling on 15 April 1509. With the archbishopric he held the commendatory Abbeys of Arbroath and Kilwinning, and in 1515 he became Lord Chancellor of Scotland. King James V was at this time a child and Beaton, as one of the Council of Regency, was one of the most important people in the kingdom during the minority of the young king. 
In 1522 Beaton was transferred to St. Andrews bishopric, vacant by the death of Archbishop Forman. As primate he threw all his powerful influence into the scale against the intrigues of Henry VIII to obtain predominance in Scotland. 
He was chiefly responsible for this king's action in allying himself with France and not with England. He burned Patrick Hamilton and other heretics. The Regent Albany's jealousy had deprived Beaton of the chancellorship some years previously, and he was never reappointed, though he enjoyed the full favour of the king. A few months after the second marriage of James to Mary of Guise, the primate got his nephew Cardinal Beaton appointed his coadjutor with right of succession. Archbishop James Beaton died in the autumn of 1539 in his castle at St. Andrews.

[/ref]
Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing that it is impossible to know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, Hieracium and Pilosella, with species such as Hieracium pilosella, Hieracium floribundum and Hieracium aurantiacum referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus Pilosella reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true Hieracium species reproduce only by seeds. In Pilosella, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of Hieracium only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of Pilosella have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of Hieracium have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.

[[Sensory memory]]
CATEGORIES: Memory processes

During every moment of an organism's life, sensory information is being taken in by sensory receptors and processed by the nervous system.The information people received which is stored in sensory memory is just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory.[tpl]cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=232[/tpl]  Humans have five main senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch. Sensory memory (SM) allows individuals to retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimulus has ceased. A common demonstration of SM is a child's ability to write letters and make circles by twirling a sparkler at night.  When the sparkler is spun fast enough, it appears to leave a trail which forms a continuous image.  This "light trail" is the image that is  represented in the visual sensory store known as iconic memory.  The other two types of SM that have been most extensively studied are echoic memory, and haptic memory; however, it is reasonable to assume that each physiological sense has a corresponding memory store.  Children for example have been shown to remember specific "sweet" tastes during incidental learning trials but the nature of this gustatory store is still unclear.[tpl]cite journal | title = Incidental learning and memory for food varied in sweet taste in children | journal = Food Quality and Preference | date = April 2011 | first = M. | last = Laureati | coauthors = E.

The A9 is a major road running from the Falkirk council area in central Scotland to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso in the far north, via Stirling, Bridge of Allan, Perth and Inverness. At 273 miles (439 km), it is the longest road in Scotland and the fifth-longest A-road in the United Kingdom. Historically it was the main road between Edinburgh and John o' Groats, and has been called the spine of Scotland.http://www.swlg.org.uk/WLN63d.htm swif.org.uk
In the south the road's importance has been eclipsed by (1) the A90 across the Forth Road Bridge and the M90 motorway, which now link Edinburgh more directly with Perth, bypassing Stirling and Bridge of Allan as formerly important bridge points, and (2) the M9, which is now the main road between Edinburgh and Bridge of Allan. Between Edinburgh and Falkirk the old A9 route has been reclassified into the A803 and the B9080 amongst others; part of the route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. Between Falkirk and Bridge of Allan, the A9 survives as a more or less parallel road to the M9.
The link between the M9 and the A9, by Bridge of Allan, is the Keir Roundabout.

Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (January 2, 1873 – September 30, 1897), or Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus and  the Holy Face, O.C.D., was a French Discalced Carmelite nun. She is popularly known as "The Little Flower of Jesus" or simply, "The Little Flower".
Thérèse has been a highly influential model of sanctity for Roman Catholics and for others because of the "simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life." Together with St. Francis of Assisi, she is one of the most popular saints in the history of the church.[tpl]cite book |last= McBrien |first= Richard P. |authorlink=Richard McBrien |title= The Pocket Guide to the Saints|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IuOlQJPbycwC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate= May 29, 2013|year= 2001|edition=1st paperback|publisher=HarperCollins |location= New York |pages= 672|quote =She was a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics in the first half of the twentieth century because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life.

Therese felt an early call to religious life, and overcoming various obstacles, in 1888 at the early age of 15, she became a nun and joined two of her elder sisters in the cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux, Normandy. After nine years as a Carmelite religious, having fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to the novice mistress, and having spent her last eighteen months in Carmel in a night of faith, she died of tuberculosis at the age of 24.
The impact of  The Story of a Soul, a collection of her autobiographical manuscripts, printed and distributed a year after her death to an initially very limited audience, was great, and she rapidly became one of the most popular saints of the twentieth century. Pope Pius XI made her the "star of his pontificate".[tpl]cite book|first=Ida Friederike|last=Görres|authorlink=Ida Friederike Görres|title=The Hidden Face.

Thérèse was declared co-patron of the missions with Francis Xavier in 1927, and named co-patron of France with Joan of Arc in 1944. On October 19, 1997 Pope John Paul II declared her the thirty-third Doctor of the Church, the youngest person, and at that time only the third woman, to be so honored. Devotion to Thérèse has developed around the world.Thérèse of Lisieux: God's gentle warrior by Thomas R. Nevin, 2006 ISBN 0-19-530721-6 p. 26.
Thérèse lived a hidden life and "wanted to be unknown," yet became popular after her death through her spiritual autobiography. She also left letters, poems, religious plays, prayers, and her last conversations were recorded by her sisters. Paintings and photographs – mostly the work of her sister Céline – further led to her being recognized by millions of men and women.
According to one of her biographers, Guy Gaucher, after her death, "Thérèse fell victim to an excess of sentimental devotion which betrayed her. She was victim also to her language, which was that of the late nineteenth century and flowed from the religiosity of her age." However, Thérèse herself said on her death-bed, "I only love simplicity. I have a horror of pretence", and she spoke out against some of the Lives of saints written in her day, "We should not say improbable things, or things we do not know. We must see their real, and not their imagined lives."Guy Gaucher, The Spiritual Journey of Therese of Lisieux, p.2
The depth of her spirituality, of which she said, "my way is all confidence and love," has inspired many believers. In the face of her littleness and nothingness, she trusted in God to be her sanctity. She wanted to go to heaven by an entirely new little way. "I wanted to find an elevator that would raise me to Jesus."  The elevator, she wrote, would be the arms of Jesus lifting her in all her littleness.
Thérèse is well known throughout the world, with the Basilica of Lisieux being the second largest place of pilgrimage in France after Lourdes.Vatican website: Proclamation as Doctor of the Church

CATEGORIES: 1961 novels, Novels by Leon Uris, Novels set in Warsaw, World War II novels, Doubleday (publisher) books

Mila 18 is a novel by Leon Uris set in German-occupied Warsaw, Poland before and during World War II. Mila 18 debuted at #7 on The New York Times Best Seller List (the second-highest debut of any Uris novel ever, bested only by the #6 debut of Trinity in 1976) and peaked at #2 in August 1961. Leon Uris's work, based on real events, covers the Nazi occupation of Poland and the atrocities of systematically dehumanising and eliminating the Jewish People of Poland. The name "Mila 18" is taken from the headquarters bunker of Jewish resistance fighters underneath the building at ulica Miła 18 (18 Mila Street, in English, 18 Pleasant Street).
The term ghetto takes on a clearer meaning as the courageous Jewish leaders fight a losing battle against not only the Nazis and their henchmen, but also profiteers and collaborators amongst themselves. Eventually, as the ghetto is reduced to rubble, a few courageous individuals with few weapons and no outside help assume command of ghetto defence, form a makeshift army and make a stand. Later, this army led to the formation of the state of Israel.

The Little Tramp, also known as The Tramp (Charlot in several languages) was British actor Charlie Chaplin's most memorable on-screen character, a recognized icon of world cinema most dominant during the silent film era.
The Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin, is a childlike, bumbling but overall good-hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a vagrant who endeavors to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while he is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics. Chaplin's films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character ("The Little Fellow," as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names onscreen, although he was sometimes identified as "Charlie" and rarely, as in the original silent version of The Gold Rush, "The Little funny Tramp".

[[Constantine's Sword]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-Catholic publications, 2001 books, Christianity and antisemitism

Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews – A History (2001) is a book by James Carroll, a former priest, which documents the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the long European history of antisemitism. The primary source of anti-Jewish violence is the perennial obsession with converting the Jews to Christianity; an event which some theologians believed would usher in the Second Coming.
Carroll disclaims the notion that Christian anti-Judaism leads inevitably to the Shoah perpetrated by National Socialism, but he argues that Church's long history of "Jew-hatred" (his term) laid the foundation for Hitler's crimes.  Carroll also points out the many "turning points," as he labels them, where the Church's attitudes and actions toward Jews could have been shifted.  Just one example cited in the book is that of Pierre Abelard (1079–1142), the French theologian and philosopher, whose teachings, had they been accepted, would have radically changed the direction and cast of Christian dogma.  
The book also analyzes, in detail, the actions of numerous popes and other prominent figures of Catholic Church history, especially those who advocated anti-Jewish policies and those who tried to rein in official antisemitism, including St. Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Nicholas of Cusa, Innocent III, Paul IV, Pius IX, Pius XII, John XXIII and John Paul II.
The book's title refers to Constantine's transformation of the cross, which Carroll points out, was not a symbol used by Christians in the first three centuries of the Church's existence, into a symbolic sword infusing a spirit of violent intolerance into the development of Christianity.  
A documentary film based on the book was shown at film festivals in August 2007. Although exploring the same themes as the book, the documentary also focuses on events which occurred subsequent to the book's publication, especially the controversy surrounding evangelical proselytizing at the U.S. Air Force Academy.  The movie was directed by Oren Jacoby, who is also listed as a producer, and written by James Carroll and Oren Jacoby. It was released by the production company, Storyville Films.

The Race has settled and plans to colonize nearly half the surface of the Earth.  This half includes Africa, Australia, China, southern Asia, Central America, South America, Spain, and Poland (consisting of the territory of prewar Poland and East Prussia).  The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, the Greater German Reich (Germany and the territories it occupied during World War II), Britain, and Japan are the only other powers when the Race's colonization fleet of eighty- to one hundred- million settlers arrives.

[[Positive liberty]]
CATEGORIES: Political concepts, Social concepts, Free will, Rights, Human rights concepts

Positive liberty is the possession of the power and resources to fulfill one's own potential as opposed to negative liberty, which is freedom from external restraint.Berlin, Isaiah. Four Essays on Liberty. 1969. A concept of positive liberty may also include freedom from internal constraints.Taylor, C. "What's Wrong with Negative Liberty" 1985. Law and Morality. 3rd ed. Ed. David Dyzenhaus, Sophia Reibetanz Moreau and Arthur Ripstein. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2008. 359–368. Print.
The concepts of structure and agency are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their free will.  Structurally speaking classism, sexism,  and racism can inhibit a person's freedom and positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of sociological agency.  Positive liberty is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in their government and have their voice, interests and concerns recognized as valid and acted upon.
Although Isaiah Berlin's essay "Two Concepts of Liberty" (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty, Frankfurt School psychoanalyst and Marxist humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in The Fear of Freedom (1941), predating Berlin's essay by more than a decade.

[[Samguk Yusa]]

CATEGORIES: 13th-century history books, History books about Korea, History of Korea

Samguk Yusa ([tpl]IPA-ko|sʰamɡuŋ njusʰa[/tpl]) or Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, is a collection of legends, folktales, and historical accounts relating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea (Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla), as well as to other periods and states before, during, and after the Three Kingdoms period.
The text was written in Classical Chinese, which was used by literate Koreans at that time. It was compiled, at least in part, by the Buddhist monk Iryeon (1206 - 1289) at the end of the 13th century, a century after the Samguk Sagi.
Unlike the more factually-oriented Samguk Sagi, the Samguk Yusa focuses on various folktales, legends, and biographies from early Korean history. Many of the founding legends of the various kingdoms in Korean history are recorded in the book. Iryeon covered legends from many Korean kingdoms, including Gojoseon, Wiman Joseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, and Gaya.
This is the earliest extant record of the Dangun legend, which records the founding of Gojoseon as the first Korean nation.

Robert Berkey Crosby (March 26, 1911 – January 7, 2000) was an American Republican politician who served as the 27th Governor of Nebraska from 1953 to 1955.
Crosby was born in North Platte, Nebraska. After attending Hastings College, Crosby transferred to the University of Minnesota.  He received a B.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1931 and an LL.B. degree from Harvard Law School in 1935.  
Crosby served in Nebraska's unicameral legislature from 1941 to 1945.  He was chosen speaker of the Unicameral in 1943 and, at 31, was the youngest person ever to hold that position. After volunteering for two years in the United States Navy, Crosby served as Nebraska's Lieutenant Governor from 1947 to 1949.  While Lieutenant Governor, Crosby wrote "Why I Want to Get Rid of My Job."
Governor Crosby, who was known as "The Boy Governor from North Platte," was particularly proud that he was a great-grandson of John Holbrook Powers.  "Honest John" Powers ran for governor in Nebraska as a populist in 1892.
In April 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Eva Bowring to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Dwight Griswold. In July 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Samuel Williams Reynolds to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Hugh A. Butler.
Crosby was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary in 1954, but was defeated by Carl T. Curtis. U.S. Senator Hazel H. Abel, who had been elected to serve the last two months of the term of the late Dwight Griswold, resigned a few days before the end of her term, and Governor Crosby appointed Curtis to serve the remainder of her term.  That gave Senator Curtis slightly more seniority than other senators elected at the same time.
Gov. Crosby was also known for his speaking ability.  He had the ability to adapt to his audience.  His style of logical, ethical and emotional appeal was used both in political speeches and in his law practice.  One of the most public aspects of his legal work was the defense of Duane Pope for murder.  Crosby's  speaking style using combinations of support (logical, ethical and emotional ) helped distinguish him from his colleagues ( Nykodym, 1968). 
Following his service as governor, Crosby practiced law in Lincoln, Nebraska, until shortly before his death in 2000. In 1971, he married LaVon K. Crosby, a Nebraska state senator from 1989 to 2000. He is buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Lincoln.

[[All-terrain vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: ATVs

An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, or four-wheeler,  is defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control.  As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street legal  within most states and provinces of Australia,  the United States or Canada.
By the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=2006-08-10|accessdate=2007-12-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html| archivedate= 13 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds.

A classic car is an older automobile; the exact definition varies around the world. The Classic Car Club of America maintains that a car must be between 30 and 49 years old to be a classic, while cars between 50 and 99 fall into a pre-antique class, and cars 100 years and older fall into the Antique Class. In the UK, 'classic cars' range from veteran (pre–First World War), to vintage (1919–1930), to post-vintage (1930s). Post–Second World War classic cars are not so precisely defined.

Emperor Gao (256 BC or 247 BC – 1 June 195 BC), commonly known by his temple name Gaozu, personal name Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han Dynasty who ruled China from 202 BC to 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who emerged from the peasant class. Liu Bang initially served as a minor patrol officer in his hometown of Pei County (in present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu) under the government of the Qin Dynasty. Sometime in the 210s or 200s BC, he rebelled against the Qin government by releasing a group of convicts he was supposed to escort to Mount Li to construct Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum, after which he and his followers took refuge as outlaws on Mount Mangdang. In 208 BC, when rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin Dynasty, Liu Bang formed his own army and participated in the insurrection. He was known as the "Duke of Pei" then and was one of the most prominent rebel leaders. After the fall of Qin in 206 BC, Xiang Yu, the de facto chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. He declared himself the king of Western Chu and appointed 17 of the former rebel leaders, including Liu Bang, as the rulers of the other kingdoms. Liu Bang was the "King of Han" and his domain was in the remote Bashu region (parts of present-day Sichuan). Later that year, Liu Bang led his forces out of Bashu and attacked and conquered the Three Qins, three of the Eighteen Kingdoms which were nearest to his domain. From 206 BC to 202 BC, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a long power struggle, historically known as the Chu–Han Contention, for supremacy over China, while concurrently invading and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 202 BC, the war concluded with victory for Liu Bang, who succeeded in unifying most of China under his control. Liu Bang established the Han Dynasty and was proclaimed Emperor that year. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and corvée, promoted Confucianism, and suppressed revolts by the rulers of some vassal states, among other things. He also initiated the policy of heqin to maintain peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu after he lost to the Xiongnu at the Battle of Baideng in 200 BC. Liu Bang died in 195 BC and was succeeded by his son Liu Ying, who became known as Emperor Hui.

Dominion Stores was once a national chain of supermarkets in Canada, which was still known as the Dominion of Canada at the time of the company's founding. The chain was founded in 1919 in Ontario and was later acquired by the Argus Corporation. It was later sold to The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P), which ultimately restricted the chain to the Greater Toronto Area, with stores outside Ontario sold to third parties.

Werner Wolff (October 7, 1883 – November 25, 1961) was a German-born conductor and musicologist who was conductor of the Hamburg Opera and founded the Chattanooga Opera Association in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Wolff was born in Berlin in 1883, the son of Hermann and Louse Wolff. His father was a founder of the Berlin PhilharmonicDaryl Black, Werner and Emmy Land Wolff, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, January 5, 2010; last updated March 7, 2011; accessed June 28, 2011 and a secretary to conductor and composer Hans von Bülow.Berthold Goldschmidt (1991). Brief Encounter: Ferruccio Busoni. Tempo (New Series), pp 7-7 [tpl]doi|10.1017/S0040298200013036[/tpl] Werner Wolff's mother discouraged her son's early interest in music as a profession, so he took a law degree at Baden, but continued to compose music as an avocation. Encouraged in his interest by prominent musicians in Berlin, he studied at the conservatory at Leipzig during the years before World War I.
Following his musical training, Wolff took positions with opera companies in Danzig, Düsseldorf, and Prague before becoming a conductor for the Hamburg Opera in 1917. He continued with the Hamburg Opera until 1932, developing a reputation as one of the leading conductors in Germany.
Wolff and his wife, operatic soprano Emmy Land, emigrated to the United States in 1938, fleeing Nazism. They resided in New York until Wolff was employed as head of the music department at Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens, Tennessee and Land became voice and music teacher at the same school. In the early 1940s they were hired by the University of Chattanooga and the Cadek Conservatory of Chattanooga, Tennessee as teachers.  In 1942 Dr. Wolff wrote a book entitled Anton Bruckner, rustic genius (ISBN 0-8154-0449-2).
Interested citizens learned of the Wolffs' operatic expertise from their great success in Europe (mainly in Hamburg, Vienna) and asked them to organize a Chattanooga Opera Association which they did in 1943. Madame Emmy Land Wolff died in 1955 and Dr. Wolff retired from opera five years later and returned to Ruschlikon, Switzerland, where he died in 1961. Many feel that this couple created a sensation with their opera productions in Chattanooga. The opera company they founded (now part of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera) is still active.

CATEGORIES: 1861 births, 1963 deaths, American legal writers, American centenarians, Harvard Law School faculty, Deans of Harvard Law School, Massachusetts lawyers, Scholars of contract law, Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States

Samuel Williston (September 24, 1861 – February 18, 1963) was an American lawyer and law professor.
Early in Williston's career, from 1888 to 1889 he worked as the private secretary to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray. In the summer of 1889, he helped to collate laws from various U.S. states in order to help formulate the state constitutions of North Dakota and South Dakota.
From 1895 to 1938, Williston was a law professor at Harvard Law School, and in 1910, he briefly served as acting dean.  Amongst his most important contributions at this time were the drafting of four laws aimed at providing national commerce with a legally uniform architecture.  The Uniform Laws of Sales (1906), Warehouse Receipts (1906), Bills of Lading (1909), and Stock Transfers (1909) would in fact serve as precedents for the construction of the Uniform Commercial Code some decades later.
He became a consultant for the Boston law firm Hale & Dorr from 1938 to 1956, during which time he was engaged in some Supreme Court cases such as Kneeland v. AT&T and Chase National Bank v. Sayles. Williston unsuccessfully argued for the defense in the case of Boston & Maine Railroad v. Hooker before the U.S. Supreme Court on December 10 and 11, 1913.
Williston wrote five volumes of his legal treatise, "The Law of Contracts", which was first published during the span of 1920 to 1922.  The treatise was widely acclaimed as the foremost authority on the topic and was later enlarged in 1938.  In 1932, Williston served as reporter for the First Restatement of Contracts, a highly influential publication in the legal community.  This treatise continues to exist to this day, currently edited by Richard A. Lord, professor at Campbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law.
In 1929, Williston was honored with the very first American Bar Association medal for "conspicuous service to American jurisprudence."http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/williston.html
In a 1963 Harvard Law Review essay, Justice Felix Frankfurter lauded Williston as being the “greatest artist in teaching.”[tpl]cite journal |last=Frankfurter |first=Felix |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1963 |month= |title=Samuel Williston: An Inadequate Tribute to a Beloved Teacher |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=76 |issue= |pages=1321 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl]

In topology, the long line (or Alexandroff line) is a topological space somewhat similar to the real line, but in a certain way "longer".  It behaves locally just like the real line, but has different large-scale properties. Therefore it serves as one of the basic counterexamples of topology.[tpl]Cite book | last1=Steen | first1=Lynn Arthur | author1-link=Lynn Arthur Steen | last2=Seebach | first2=J.

[[Long line (telecommunications)]]
CATEGORIES: Telephony, Communication circuits

In telephone systems nomenclature, a long line is a transmission line in a long-distance communications network such as carrier systems, microwave radio relay links, geosynchronous satellite links, underground cables, aerial cables and open wire, and Submarine communications cables.   In the United States, some of this technology was spun off into the corporate entity known as AT&T Long Distance with the breakup of AT&T in 1984.  Prior to then, the AT&T Long Lines division of the Bell System, which was what AT&T called itself when it was responsible for providing both long distance and local telephone service before the 1984 breakup, provided maintenance and installation of long line facilities for the Bell System's long distance service.

[[Longline fishing]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing industry, Fishing techniques and methods, Seabirds

Longline fishing is a commercial fishing technique. It uses a long line, called the main line, with baited hooks attached at intervals by means of branch lines called snoods (or gangions).Method and Apparatus for Long Line and Recreational Bait Fishing Patent application 20080202013. 28 August 2008. A snood is a short length of line, attached to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. Longliners commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.European Union: Identifying Maltese fishing grounds
In some unstable fisheries, such as the Patagonian toothfish, fishermen may be limited to as few as 25 hooks per line. In contrast, commercial longliners in certain robust fisheries of the Bering Sea and North Pacific generally run over 2,500 hand-baited hooks on a single series of connected lines many miles in length.Rice J, Cooper J, Medley P and Hough A (2006) South Georgia Patagonian Toothfish Longline Fishery Moody Marine.
Longlines can be set to hang near the surface (pelagic longline) to catch fish such as tuna and swordfish or along the sea floor (demersal longline) for groundfish such as halibut or cod. Longliners fishing for sablefish, also referred to as black cod, occasionally set gear on the sea floor at depths exceeding [tpl]convert|1100|m[/tpl] using relatively simple equipment. Longlines with traps attached rather than hooks can be used for crab fishing in deep waters.
Longline fishing is prone to the incidental catching and killing of seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks.[tpl]cite web|title=NOAA releases first nation bycatch report|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110922_bycatchreport.html|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=19 April 2012[/tpl]

Trading stamps are small paper coupons given to customers by merchants in loyalty marketing programs that predate the modern loyalty card.  Like the similarly-issued retailer coupons, these stamps only had a minimal cash value of a few mils (hundredths of a cent) individually, but when a customer accumulated a number of them, they could be exchanged with the trading stamp company (usually a third-party issuer of the stamps) for premiums, such as toys, personal items, housewares, furniture and appliances.

[[Library of Living Philosophers]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy books, Series of books, 1939 works

The Library of Living Philosophers is a series of books conceived of and started by Paul Arthur Schilpp in 1939; Schilpp remained editor until 1981.  The series was edited by Lewis Edwin Hahn from 1981 until 2001, and is currently edited by Randall Auxier.  Each volume is devoted to a single living philosopher of note, and contains, alongside an "intellectual autobiography" of its subject and a complete bibliography, a collection of critical and interpretive essays by several dozen contemporary philosophers on aspects of the subject's work, with responses by the subject.  The Library was originally conceived as a means by which a philosopher could reply to his or her interpreters while still alive, hopefully resolving endless philosophical disputes about what someone "really meant." While its success in this line has been questionable—a reply, after all, can stand just as much in need of interpretation as an original essay—the series has become a noted philosophical resource and the site of much significant contemporary argument.
The series was published by Northwestern University from its inception through 1949; by Tudor Publishing Co. from 1952 to 1959; and since then by Open Court. The series is owned by Southern Illinois University Carbondale.
Subjects of the Library, to date, are:

South Kensington is a London Underground station in Kensington, west London. It is served by the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines. On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly Line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. The main station entrance is located at the junction of Old Brompton Road (A3218), Thurloe Place, Harrington Road, Onslow Place and Pelham Street. Subsidiary entrances are located in Exhibition Road giving access by pedestrian tunnel to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums. Also close by are the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the London branch of the Goethe-Institut and the Ismaili Centre.
The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the Metropolitan District Railway as part of the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and mainline services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the two parts of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.

He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one.

Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich (November 6, 1841 — April 16, 1915) was a prominent American politician and a leader of the Republican Party in the Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1911.
Because of his impact on national politics and central position on the pivotal Senate Finance Committee, he was referred to by the press and public alike as the "General Manager of the Nation", dominating all tariff and monetary policies in the first decade of the 20th century. In a career that spanned three decades, Aldrich helped to create an extensive system of tariffs that protected American factories and farms from foreign competition, while driving the price of consumer goods artificially high. He was a party to the re-structuring of the American financial system  through the institution of the federal income tax amendment, which he originally opposed,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] and the Federal Reserve System. He stated that he believed these reforms would lead to greater efficiency. Aldrich became wealthy with insider investments in street railroads, sugar, rubber and banking.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] His son Richard Steere Aldrich became a U.S. Representative, and his daughter, Abby, married John D.

The United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) is a theater-level Unified Combatant Command of the U.S. Department of Defense, established in 1983. It was originally conceived of as the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF).
Its area of responsibility includes countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, most notably Afghanistan and Iraq. USCENTCOM (also called CENTCOM) has been the main American presence in many military operations, including the Persian Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan (2001–present), and the Iraq War. Forces from CENTCOM  currently are deployed primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan in combat roles and have bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Pakistan, and central Asia in support roles. CENTCOM forces have also been deployed in Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in the past, and although there is a small presence remaining in each of those countries, no substantial U.S. forces are based there [tpl]As of|2009|lc=on[/tpl].

Of the six American regional unified commands, CENTCOM is one of three regional unified commands whose headquarters are not within its area of operations. CENTCOM's main headquarters is located at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida, although a forward headquarters was established in 2002 at Camp As Sayliyah in Doha, Qatar, which transitioned to a new forward headquarters at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in 2009 to serve American strategic interests if the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) and Area of Interest (AOI). The other regional unified commands with headquarters located outside their areas of operations are United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), currently based in Miami, Florida, and United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), currently based in Stuttgart, Germany.
Exercise Internal Look is one of the Command's primary planning events. Up until around 1990, it was annual, but it is now held every two years. Up until 1990 it was frequently used to train CENTCOM to be ready to defend the Zagros Mountains from a Soviet attack.Norman Schwarzkopf, It Doesn't Take a Hero, Bantam Books paperback edition, 1993, p.331–2, 335–6. ISBN 0-553-56338-6. Harold Coyle's novel Sword Point gives an impression of what such planning envisaged, by a U.S. Army officer who would have had some idea of the general planning approach. It has been employed for explicit war planning on at least two occasions: Internal Look '90, which was held after General Norman Schwarzkopf reoriented CENTCOM's planning to fending off a threat from Iraq, and Internal Look '03, which was used to plan what became Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Dingbats is the name of a board game that was devised by Paul Sellers and is currently manufactured by Ravensburger. The game, for two or more people, involves solving rebuses (puzzles in which a common word or saying is hidden in a cryptic or otherwise unique arrangement of symbols).
There is a time limit to solve each puzzle, and success means you can move further along the board. The winner is the person to reach the end square first. The name Dingbats is a registered trademark.http://www.ipo.gov.uk/domestic?domesticnum=1290344
The name may relate to the style in which the rebuses were printed, involving prolific use of dingbats.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]

Christopher William Burford, III (born January 31, 1938) is a former American football wide receiver. Burford was a master of sideline receptions for the Dallas Texans and the Kansas City Chiefs.  What he lacked in great speed or physical presence, he made up for by running perfectly choreographed pass routes that outsmarted most American Football League defensive backs.  
He was a football captain at Stanford, leading the NCAA in receptions with 61 in 1959. The following year, he was a first round draft pick of the Dallas Texans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=28203|author=Paige Ricks|title=The Rookies|publisher=Stanford Magazine|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]  He led the Texans/Chiefs in pass receptions in four seasons (1961–63 and 1965). An AFL All-Star in 1961, he followed that performance with a team-record 12 receptions for touchdowns in 1962.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.kcchiefs.com/hall_of_fame/chris_burford/|title=Hall of Fame: Chris Burford - 1975|publisher=Kansas City Chiefs|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]  By the end of his career he was the Chiefs all-time reception leader (391) with 5,505 yards and 55 touchdowns.
Teaming with Hall of Famer Len Dawson, Burford was a clutch receiver when the game was on the line and the ball had to be moved forward for a needed first down or for field goal position.  For most of his AFL career, Burford was in the top ten in receiving catches, yards, and touchdowns.  Burford is a 1975 inductee of the Chiefs' Hall of Fame.  In 2010 he was inducted into the African-American Ethnic Sports Hall of Fame.http://www.budwinter.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/OaklandInductionCeremony_HOFver2.pdf  Burford, who is white, was nominated by former black teammate Abner Hayes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=28203|author=Paige Ricks|title=The Rookies|publisher=Stanford Magazine|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]

One Atlantic Center, also known as IBM Tower, is a skyscraper located in Midtown Atlanta.  It is the third-tallest in Atlanta, reaching a height of [tpl]convert|820|ft|m[/tpl] with 50 stories of office space.  It was completed in 1987 and remained the tallest building in Atlanta until 1992, when it was surpassed by the Bank of America Plaza, which was also built in Midtown. It was also the tallest building in the southeastern U.S. at the time of completion, surpassing the Southeast Financial Center in Miami.
The building was commissioned by Prentiss Properties as a southeastern headquarters for IBM, a company responsible for many notable skyscrapers of the 1980s.  Aside from introducing Atlanta to the postmodern architectural idiom of the 80s, this tower is notable for essentially creating what is now the Midtown commercial district.  Located at the then-remote corner of 14th and West Peachtree Streets over a mile from Downtown, this building nevertheless opened nearly fully occupied and thus attracted developers to Midtown in droves.
The building's exterior consists of Spanish pink granite with a copper pyramidal top and gold peak. The design includes gothic flourishes, most noticeably below the copper top of the building. At night the peak and ridges along the top are illuminated brightly, creating a glowing effect.
It was joined in 2001 by the much shorter Atlantic Center Plaza building, which bears similar postmodern design and was constructed across the street as the second phase of the Atlantic Center development.  Atlantic Center Plaza's design and architecture are so similar, it has affectionately become known in Atlanta as the "Mini Me" building, named after the comical dwarfish clone of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies. Phase III sits on the drawing boards as the developers await a tenant.
One Atlantic Center was designed by Johnson/Burgee Architects. As associate architect, Heery International, Inc. produced the contract documents.
Both Atlantic Center Towers were constructed by HCBeck, now known as The Beck Group.

[[Humoral immunity]]
CATEGORIES: Immunology

Humoral immunity, also called the antibody-mediated immune system, is the aspect of immunity that is mediated by macromolecules, as opposed to cell-mediated immunity, found in extracellular fluids such as secreted antibodies, complement proteins and certain antimicrobial peptides. Humoral immunity is so named because it involves substances found in the humours, or body fluids. 
The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology. The immune system is divided into a more primitive innate immune system, and acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, each of which contains humoral and cellular components.
Humoral immunity refers to antibody production and the accessory processes that accompany it, including: Th2 activation and cytokine production, germinal center formation and isotype switching, affinity maturation and memory cell generation. It also refers to the effector functions of antibodies, which include pathogen and toxin neutralization, classical complement activation, and opsonin promotion of phagocytosis and pathogen elimination.[tpl]cite book | author = Janeway CA  | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | id = (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf) | author-separator = , | author2 = Jr.| display-authors = 2 | isbn = 0-8153-3642-X [/tpl]

Emperor Wen of Han (202–157 BC) was the fifth emperor of the Han Dynasty of ancient China. His personal name was Liu Heng.
Liu Heng was a son of Emperor Gao of Han and Consort Bo, later empress dowager. When Emperor Gao suppressed the rebellion of Dai, he made Liu Heng Prince of Dai.
After Empress Dowager Lü's death, the officials eliminated the powerful Lü clan, and deliberately chose the Prince of Dai as the emperor, since his mother, Consort Bo, had no powerful relatives, and her family was known for its humility and thoughtfulness.  His reign brought a much needed political stability that laid the groundwork for prosperity under his grandson Emperor Wu. According to historians, Emperor Wen trusted and consulted with ministers on state affairs; under the influence of his Taoist wife, Empress Dou, the emperor also sought to avoid wasteful expenditures.
Historians noted that the tax rates were at a ratio of "1 out of 30" and "1 out of 60", corresponding to 3.33% and 1.67%, respectively.  (These rates are not for income taxes, but property taxes, as the only ancient Chinese attempt to levy an income tax would come in the time of Wang Mang.)  Warehouses were so full of grain, that some of it was left to decay.
In a move of lasting importance in 165 BC, Emperor Wen introduced recruitment to the civil service through examinations. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic examinations. Their names were sent by local officials to the central government based on reputations and abilities, which were sometimes judged subjectively.

During that time period the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel was the tallest building in Atlanta. It has a stair-like design that staggers down to the ground, and is clad in pink granite quarried from Tate, Georgia.
The tower is on the former site of the Loew's Grand Theatre, where the premiere for the 1939 film Gone with the Wind was held. (133 Peachtree St. NE, near intersection of Peachtree and Forsyth streets) The theatre could not be demolished because of its landmark status; when it burned down in 1978, clearing the way for the tower.
The architectural firm that built it was Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.  The tower is the world headquarters of Georgia-Pacific. Other tenants include consulting firm McKinsey & Company and the downtown branch of the High Museum of Art, which opened in 1986.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
On March 14, 2008, the tower sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta.  A number of windows were blown out. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since weather record keeping began in the 1880s.[tpl]cite web | author=Tim Eberly; Paul Shea | title=Tornado Kills, 2 Pummels Downtown | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/03/14/domeburst_0315.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab | publisher=Atlanta Journal and Constitution | date=March 15, 2008 | accessdate=7 February 2011[/tpl]

It has 40 stories of office space and its construction was completed in 1990.  It is currently the seventh-tallest skyscraper in Atlanta.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
Set just off Peachtree Street on 15th Street, it sits on the same block as One Atlantic Center and was only the second major office tower in Midtown.  It is set diagonally to the street grid to maximize its impact on the skyline and allow tenants better views. Its postmodern design makes it seem even taller than it really is when viewed up close. It is clad in highly reflective glass and has a ziggurat-like tapering spire with stainless steel fins that are lit at night.  Promenade was intended to be the first of 3 towers of identical design on the block that it occupies.  The two other towers, of 48 and 58 stories, were never built due to the collapse of the commercial real estate market in the early 1990s. Promenade itself was originally planned for [tpl]convert|857|ft|m[/tpl] (57 stories) but was scaled back before completion due to the market collapse. The land they were to occupy is now home to the 41-story 1180 Peachtree Street office tower.
The architectural firms that worked on this project were Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates (TVS) and the Ai Group.  TVS, which was also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center highrise development on Atlanta's northern edge, has its headquarters in the building.  The engineering firm that worked on the Promenade was Thompson Company, Inc. (TCI).  TCI is also responsible for the Concourse at Landmark Center.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]

[[Farm-to-market road]]
CATEGORIES: Farm to Market Roads in Texas, Roads in the United States, Types of roads

In the United States, a farm-to-market road or ranch-to-market road (sometimes farm road or ranch road for short) is a state road or county road that connects rural or agricultural areas to market towns. These are better quality roads, usually a highway, that farmers and ranchers use to transport products to market towns or distribution centers.
Specifically, in the state of Texas, the terms Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road indicate roadways that are part of the state's system of secondary and connecting routes, built and maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Texas established this system in 1949 to provide access to rural areas. The system consists primarily of paved, two-lane roads. Generally, roads west of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|281[/tpl] (or Interstate 35 in some locations) are designated Ranch to Market Roads, while those east of US 281 are designated Farm to Market Roads—though there are exceptions to this naming system, such as [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|RM|2588[/tpl] in Henderson County in East Texas or [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1215[/tpl] in Reeves County West Texas.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Texas Department of Transportation |author=Staff |url=http://www.dot.state.tx.us/tpp/hwy/fmfacts.htm|title=Farm/Ranch to Market Facts |accessdate=February 26, 2008 [/tpl]  Oddly, Erath, Comanche, Brown and several other counties along and west of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|281[/tpl] also appear to be exceptions to this rule, using Farm to Market designations primarily, if not exclusively. Some segments are even expressways, including a segment of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1764[/tpl] (the Emmett F. Lowry Expressway between Interstate 45 and Texas City, Texas). 
These roads are signed with route markers that contain the words FARM ROAD or RANCH ROAD, but the formal name is Farm to Market Road and Ranch to Market Road (hence the abbreviation "FM" and "RM" on signs). The only road that explicitly uses the name Ranch Road is Ranch Road 1, which runs near the former ranch home of former President Lyndon B. Johnson.
As with other state-maintained highways in Texas, all Farm or Ranch to Market roads are paved. Speed limits along these roads vary, but may be as high as 75 mph in rural areas, such as in Andrews and Pecos Counties (for example, along [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1788[/tpl], [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1776[/tpl], and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1053[/tpl]).

The Norwegian Baptist Union (NBU) (Det Norske Baptistsamfunn) is a national organization of Baptists in Norway for promoting cooperation in missions, benevolence, and education; also called the Baptist Union of Norway.
Enoch Richard Haftorsen Svee, a young Norwegian supported by American Baptists, returned to Norway in 1842 and ministered there, but died before any churches were established. The first Baptist church in Norway was founded at Skien in 1862 by Frederick Ludvig Rymker, a former Danish sailor turned missionary. The Baptists formed regional associations. The first (South) was formed in 1872, and North & West in 1877. 13 representatives from 8 churches met and formed the Norwegian Baptist Union (NBU) in 1878, with Janne M. Sjödahl being elected its first general secretary in 1879. The Baptist Missionary Society of England supported the work in Norway, beginning with Rymker, until 1892. When this support was discontinued, the Norwegians requested and received support from the American Baptist Missionary Union. Baptists of Norway established a theological seminary in 1910, a youth association in 1922, and a high school in 1958.
The NBU is a member of the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. According to the official Union web site, current membership (2003) includes 4971 members in 69 congregations. Two non-Union churches, numbering about 75 members, cooperate with the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism.

The Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the mountains of southern Europe and southern temperate Asia across to China. It is a short-distance migrant moving to wet open lowlands such as marshes and flooded fields in winter. Some birds migrate north to Britain for winter, taking advantage of the warm oceanic climate[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl].
Like most other pipits, this is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and dark streaked buff below. It has dark legs, white outer tail feathers and a longish dark bill. In summer it has a distinctive breeding plumage, with a pinkish breast, grey head and pale supercilium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Per Alström & Krister Mild |year=1996 |title=The identification of Rock, Water and Buff-bellied Pipits |journal=Alula |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=161–175[/tpl][tpl]cite conference |author=Per Alström & Krister Mild |year=1987 |title=Some notes on the taxonomy of the Water Pipit complex |conference=Proceedings of the 4th International Identification Meeting |location=Eilat |pages=47–48 |publisher=International Birdwatching Center[/tpl]

Australian Baptist Ministries (ABM) (formerly Baptist Union of Australia (BUA)) is the oldest and largest national cooperative body of Baptists in Australia. Its current National President is Reverend Dr John Beasy.
The Baptist work in Australia began in Sydney in 1831, forty-three years after the British penal colony was established. The first preacher was John McKaeg. The first baptism was in Woolloomooloo Bay in 1832.

The national Baptist Union was founded in 1926 by representatives from existing state unions.
Australian Baptist Ministries is a member of the Asia Pacific Baptist Federation (formerly Asian Baptist Federation) and the Baptist World Alliance. Ministry arms of ABM include Global Interaction (formerly known as the Australian Baptist Missionary Society), Australian Baptist World Aid, Baptist Care, and a number of Delegated Bodies which represent communities of practice, developing strategies and resources that benefit the Australian Baptist movement.

[[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]

CATEGORIES: Hippodrome of Constantinople

The Hippodrome of Constantinople  ([tpl]lang-tr|Sultanahmet Meydanı, At Meydanı[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-tr|sulˌtanahˈmet[/tpl]) was a circus that was the sporting and social centre of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. Today it is a square named Sultanahmet Meydanı (Sultan Ahmet Square) in the Turkish city of Istanbul, with a few fragments of the original structure surviving. It is sometimes also called Atmeydanı (Horse Square) in Turkish.
The word hippodrome comes from the Greek hippos ('ιππος), horse, and dromos (δρομος), path or way. Horse racing and chariot racing were popular pastimes in the ancient world and hippodromes were common features of Greek cities in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine eras.

[[Richard's Pipit]]

CATEGORIES: Anthus, Birds of Asia, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of India, Birds of Europe, Birds of Turkey, Birds of China, Birds of Kazakhstan, Birds of Mongolia, Birds of Russia, Birds of Thailand, Animals described in 1818

The Richard's Pipit (Anthus richardi) is a medium-sized passerine bird which breeds in open grasslands in northern Asia. It is a long-distance migrant moving to open lowlands in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe. This bird was named after the French naturalist Monsieur Richard of Lunéville.
It belongs to the pipit genus Anthus in the family Motacillidae. It was formerly lumped together with the Australasian, African, Mountain and Paddyfield Pipits in a single species: Richard's Pipit, Anthus novaeseelandiae. These pipits are now commonly considered to be separate species although the African and Paddyfield Pipits are sometimes treated as part of Anthus richardi.

[[Blyth's Pipit]]
CATEGORIES: Anthus, Birds of Bhutan, Birds of Pakistan, Birds of India

The Blyth's Pipit (Anthus godlewskii) is a medium-sized passerine bird which breeds in Mongolia and neighbouring areas. It is a long distance migrant moving to open lowlands in southern Asia. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.
This is a large pipit, but is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and pale below. It is very similar to Richard's Pipit, but is slightly smaller, shorter legs and a shorter dark bill. Its flight is strong and direct, and it gives a characteristic "pshee" call, higher pitched than Richard's.
In south Asia, in winter some care must be taken to distinguish this from other large pipits which winter or are resident in the area, including Richard's. This species is insectivorous.
This bird was named after the English zoologist Edward Blyth.

The Isle of Purbeck, not a true island but a peninsula, is in the county of Dorset, England. It is bordered by the English Channel to the south and east, where steep cliffs fall to the sea; and by the marshy lands of the River Frome and Poole Harbour to the north. Its western boundary is less well defined, with some medieval sources placing it at Flower's Barrow above Worbarrow Bay.An inquisition taken at Corfe Castle in 1370 quotes a document that affirms "that the whole Isle of Purbeck is a warren of our lord the King and pertains to his said castle, and it extends from a path which is between Flouresberi and the wood of Wytewey and thence as far as Luggerford, from that to the bridge of Wareham, and so along the sea, in an easterly direction, to a place called the Castle of Stodland; thence by the sea-coast to the chapel of St Aldhalm, and from thence still by the sea-coast towards the west until it again reaches the aforesaid place of Flouresberi".

Neo-Confucianism ([tpl]zh|t=宋明理學|s=宋明理学|p=Sòng-Míng Lǐxué[/tpl] often shortened to 理學) is a moral, ethical, and metaphysical Chinese philosophy influenced by Confucianism, and originated with Han Yu and Li Ao (772-841) in the Tang Dynasty, and became prominent during the Song and Ming dynasties. 
Neo-Confucianism was an attempt  to create a more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of Daoism and Buddhism that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han Dynasty.[tpl]cite book|last= Blocker |first=H.

[[Addison's disease]]

CATEGORIES: Medical emergencies, Endocrine-related cutaneous conditions, Adrenal gland disorders

Addison’s disease (also Addison disease, chronic adrenal insufficiency,  hypocortisolism, and hypoadrenalism) is a rare, chronic endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones (glucocorticoids and often mineralocorticoids). It is characterised by a number of relatively nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal pain and weakness, but under certain circumstances, these may progress to Addisonian crisis, a severe illness which may include very low blood pressure and coma.
The condition arises from problems with the adrenal gland, primary adrenal insufficiency, and can be caused by damage by the body's own immune system, certain infections, or various rarer causes. Addison's disease is also known as chronic primary adrenocortical insufficiency, to distinguish it from acute primary adrenocortical insufficiency, most often caused by Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. Addison's disease should also be distinguished from secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency, which are caused by deficiency of ACTH (produced by the pituitary gland) and CRH (produced by the hypothalamus), respectively. Despite this distinction, Addisonian crises can happen in all forms of adrenal insufficiency.
Addison's disease and other forms of hypoadrenalism are generally diagnosed via blood tests and medical imaging. Treatment involves replacing the absent hormones (oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone). Lifelong, continuous steroid replacement therapy is required, with regular follow-up treatment and monitoring for other health problems.
Addison’s disease is named after Thomas Addison, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School who first described the condition in 1849. The adjective "Addisonian" is used to describe features of the condition, as well as patients suffering from Addison’s disease.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Ten | first1 = Svetlana | last2 = New | first2 = Maria | last3 = Maclaren | first3 = Noel | title = Clinical review 130: Addison's disease 2001 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 86 | issue = 7 | pages = 2909–2922 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11443143 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/86/7/2909 | doi = 10.1210/jc.86.7.2909 [/tpl]

Bernhard Vogel (born 19 December 1932) is a German politician (CDU).
Vogel was born in Göttingen. He was Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate from 1976 to 1988, where he was succeeded by Carl-Ludwig Wagner, and of Thuringia from 5 February 1992 to 5 June 2003, where he was succeeded by Dieter Althaus. He is the only person to have been premier of two different German federal states and is the longest governing Minister-President of Germany.  His brother is the SPD politician Hans-Jochen Vogel. He twice served as President of the Bundesrat in 1976/77 and 1987/88.
From 1965 to 1967, Vogel was a member of the German Bundestag, a position from which he resigned to assume the job of Minister of Culture and Education in Rhineland-Palatinate under Premier Peter Altmeier.  He continued in the same cabinet position under Altmeier's successor in 1969, Helmut Kohl.  In 1973, when Kohl became chair of the national CDU, Vogel succeeded him as state party chair in Rhineland-Palatinate.  His failure to be re-elected to this party office in 1988 led to his resignation as premier in a famous speech which he ended with the often-quoted phrase: "May God protect Rhineland-Palatinate!", an unusual display of public piety for German standards.  Vogel is a devout Roman Catholic.

It was followed by the Rajput clans in order to avoid capture, enslavement and dishonour at the hands of Muslim invaders.
Jauhar (also spelled jowhar) was originally the voluntary death on a funeral of the queens and female royals of Rajput kingdoms defeated by Muslim rulers.Pratibha Jain, Saṅgītā Śarmā, Honour, status & polity The term is extended to describe the occasional practice of mass suicide carried out in medieval times by Rajput women and men.

[[Radon–Nikodym theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Theorems in measure theory, Articles containing proofs, Generalizations of the derivative, Integral representations

In mathematics, the Radon–Nikodym theorem is a result in measure theory that states that, given a measurable space [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl], if a [tpl]mvar|σ[/tpl]-finite measure [tpl]mvar|ν[/tpl] on [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl] is absolutely continuous with respect to a [tpl]mvar|σ[/tpl]-finite measure [tpl]mvar|μ[/tpl] on [tpl]math|(X, Σ)[/tpl], then there is a measurable function [tpl]math| f  : X → [0, ∞)[/tpl], such that for any measurable subset [tpl]math|A ⊂ X[/tpl]:
The function [tpl]math| f [/tpl] is called the Radon–Nikodym derivative and denoted by [tpl]math|[tpl]sfrac|dν|dμ[/tpl][/tpl].
The theorem is named after Johann Radon, who proved the theorem for the special case where the underlying space is [tpl]math|RN[/tpl] in 1913, and for Otto Nikodym who proved the general case in 1930.[ref]
</ref> In 1936 [[Hans Freudenthal]] further generalized the Radon–Nikodym theorem by proving the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]], a result in [[Riesz space]] theory, which contains the Radon–Nikodym theorem as a special case.<ref>[tpl]Cite book| last = Zaanen  | first = Adriaan C. | year = 1996  | title = Introduction to Operator Theory in Riesz spaces | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn = 3-540-61989-5 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]</ref>
If [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl] is a Banach space and the generalization of the Radon–Nikodym theorem also holds for functions with values in [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl] (mutatis mutandis), then [tpl]mvar|Y[/tpl] is said to have the Radon–Nikodym property. All Hilbert spaces have the Radon–Nikodym property.

Thomas Wyatt Turner (March 16, 1877 – April 21, 1978) was an American civil rights activist, biologist and educator. Born in Hughesville, Maryland, Turner attended Episcopal local schools after Catholic schools refused to admit him because of his race.
After receiving the proper credentials, Turner headed to the Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, where he taught academics in biology. Later, he gave service to various public schools in Baltimore, Maryland. From 1914 to 1924, he served as a Professor of Botany at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and also served from 1914 to 1920 as the Acting Dean at the Howard's School of Education.
While working at Cornell University in 1918, Turner did special work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Maine, where he examined potato fields. The American government consulted Turner throughout his career about agricultural problems. Under the auspices of the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Turner worked as a collaborator on Virginia's plant diseases. He was also the first black person ever to receive a doctorate from Cornell. In 1931, Turner organized the Virginia Conference of College Science Teachers in 1931, and served as president of that group for two terms.  Turner also was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Society for Horticultural Science, both of which he was very active in.
Turner was also known as an activist who was a staunch defender of black rights and civil liberties. His activism, curiously, has overshadowed his many scientific accomplishments. In 1909, he was a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and was also active in trying to get blacks the right to vote. He was eventually honored with a lifetime membership in the NAACP.  Turner was initiated as a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity in 1915.
Turner was active in Catholic organizations and in societies for the advancement of African-Americans. In 1925, Turner founded the Federated Colored Catholics (FCC), an organization that he said was "composed of Catholic Negroes who placed their services at the disposal of the Church for whatever good they were able to effect in the solution of the problems facing the group in Church and country". Turner remained a loyal member of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1976, Washington, D.C.'s Black Catholics named its highest award for Turner. That same year, at age 99, Turner was awarded a degree by The Catholic University of America.
He died at the age of 101 in 1978, 36 days after celebrating his birthday.

[[Dysderidae]]
CATEGORIES: Dysderidae

The family Dysderidae (woodlouse hunters, sowbug-eating spiders or cell spiders) are araneomorph spiders found primarily in Eurasia, although extending into North Africa, with very few species occurring in South America, and one (Dysdera crocata) introduced into many regions of the world.
Dysderids have six eyes, and are haplogyne, i.e. the females lack a sclerotized epigyne. There is a substantial number of genera, but two of them, Dysdera and Harpactea, account for a very large number of the species and are widespread across the family's range. One species, Dysdera crocata (the woodlouse hunter), has been transported over much of the planet together with its preferred foods - woodlice. Dysdera also feeds on beetles. These spiders have very large chelicerae, which they use to pierce the armored bodies of woodlice and beetles.  There are also some reports that they have a mildly toxic venom that can cause local reactions in humans; with their huge fangs there is little doubt that they could bite if threatened, but the venom has not been well studied. Most give a threat display before attacking, and the bite is less painful than a bee sting.
The spiders have their six eyes arranged in a semicircle like segestrids, but have only the first two pairs of legs produced forward. Dysdera crocata has a characteristic coloring, which can only be confused with spiders in the corinnid genera Trachelas and Meriola:  the carapace is dull red-brown and the abdomen gray or tan.  The "two-tone" look, with the abdomen much lighter than the cephalothorax, is quite striking.
These rather large, burly-looking, slow-moving spiders are often seen in the autumn in basements and other cool areas of homes; presumably they are looking for a winter shelter.

[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]]
CATEGORIES: Dog breeds, Spaniels, Companion dogs, Toy dogs, Dog breeds originating in England

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small spaniel classed as a toy dog by The Kennel Club. It is one of the most popular breeds in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States. It is a smaller breed of spaniel, and Cavalier adults are often the same size as adolescent dogs of other spaniel breeds. It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim, Tricolour (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however, they require a lot of human interaction.
The King Charles changed drastically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration. Various health issues affect this particular breed.

Rannoch Moor[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] (Scottish Gaelic: Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach) is a large expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends into Perth and Kinross, Lochaber in Highland, and northern Argyll and Bute.  Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.1331, 8348. Rannoch Moor, Scottish National Heritage Sitelink. Scottish National Heritage. 2012.
It is notable for its wildlife, particularly famous for the sole British location for the Rannoch-rush, named after the moor. It was frequently visited by Horace Donisthorpe, who collected many unusual species of ants on the moor and surrounding hilly ground. Today it is still one of the few remaining habitats for Formica exsecta, the "narrow-headed ant", although recent surveys have failed to produce any sign of Formica pratensis, which Donisthorpe recorded in the area in the early part of the 20th century.
Peat deposits pose major difficulties to builders of roads and railways. When the West Highland Line was built across Rannoch Moor, its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots, brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes.
The A82 road crosses through Rannoch Moor on its way to Glen Coe and Fort William. Additionally, the West Highland Railway line crosses the moor. The railway rises to over 1300 feet and travels over 23 miles of moorland.

[[Toleration]]

[tpl]redirects here|Tolerate|other uses|Tolerance (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Tolerance[/tpl]

Toleration is "the practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves. One can meaningfully speak of tolerating—i.e., of allowing or permitting—only if one is in a position to disallow." It has also been defined as "to bear or endure" or "to nourish, sustain or preserve." Toleration may signify "no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful."Perez Zagorin, How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West (Princeton: Princeton University Press 2003) ISBN 0-691-09270-2 , pp. 5–6, quoting D.D. Raphael et al.
There is only one verb 'to tolerate' and one adjective 'tolerant,' but the two nouns 'tolerance' and 'toleration' have evolved slightly different meanings. Tolerance is an attitude of mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tolerance|title= Tolerance|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-03-07[/tpl] whereas toleration implies putting up with something that one disapproves of.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toleration|title= Toleration|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-03-07[/tpl]
Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion. In the twentieth century and after, analysis of the doctrine of toleration has been expanded to include political and ethnic groups, homosexuals and other minorities, and human rights embodies the principle of legally enforced toleration.

The statue was constructed in only four days out of foam and papier-mâché over a metal armature. The constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible so the government would be unable to dismantle it. The government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing.  Despite these efforts, the statue was destroyed by soldiers clearing the square of protesters, but has been copied a number of times.

Bedřich (Friedrich) Hrozný ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈbɛdr̝ɪx ˈɦrozniː|lang|Cs-Bedrich Hrozny.ogg[/tpl]; May 6, 1879 – December 12, 1952) was a Czech orientalist and linguist. He deciphered the ancient Hittite language, identified it as an Indo-European language and laid the groundwork for the development of Hittitology. 
Hrozný was born in Lysá nad Labem, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. In the town of Kolín he learned Hebrew and Arabic. At the University of Vienna, he studied Akkadian, Aramaic, Ethiopian, Sumerian and Sanskrit, as well as the cuneiform used in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia and Persia. He also studied orientalism at Humboldt University of Berlin. 
In 1905, following excavations in Palestine, he became Professor at the University of Vienna.
In 1906, at Hattusa (modern Boğazkale, about 200 km east of Ankara) a German expedition found the archives of the Hittite kings in cuneiform, but in an unknown language. While on active duty in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I, Hrozný published in 1917 a description of the language showing that it belonged to the Indo-European family.[tpl]cite book|first=Silvia |last=Luraghi |year=1997 |title=Hittite |publisher=Lincom Europa |location=Munich |isbn=3-89586-076-X |page=1[/tpl]
In 1925 Hrozný led a Czech archaeological team that discovered 1000 cuneiform tablets containing contracts and letters of Assyrian merchants in the Turkish village of Kültepe, and excavated the nearby ancient Hittite city of Kanesh. 
Later in his life, he tried to decipher the hieroglyphic script used by the Hittites and scripts used in ancient India and Crete, but failed in his effort. From 1919 to 1952, he was a Professor of cuneiform research and ancient Oriental history at the Charles University in Prague. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia he was made rector of the Charles University. 
A heart attack in 1944 ended his scientific work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/116219 |first=Christian |last=Falvey |title=Bedřich Hrozný – Re-Discoverer of the Hittite Language |publisher=Radio Praha |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl].

The Emperor's New Groove is a 2000 American traditionally animated buddy-comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures on December 15, 2000. It is the 40th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The title refers to the Danish fairy tale The Emperor's New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen, though the two have little else in common. A comedy produced by Randy Fullmer and directed by Mark Dindal, The Emperor's New Groove was altered significantly over six years of development and production from its original concept as a more traditional Disney animated musical entitled Kingdom of the Sun, to have been directed by Dindal and Roger Allers (co-director of The Lion King).
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "My Funny Friend and Me" performed by Sting, but lost to "Things Have Changed" by Bob Dylan from Wonder Boys.
A direct-to-video sequel, Kronk's New Groove, was released in December 2005, followed by an animated television series, The Emperor's New School, in January 2006.

The Pahlavi dynasty ([tpl]lang-fa|دودمان پهلوی[/tpl]), officially the Imperial State of Iran, was the reigning constitutional monarchy of Iran from 1925 until 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and abolished as a result of the Iranian Revolution. The Imperial State was founded by Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdication by the Allies after the Anglo-Soviet invasion. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.
The Pahlavis came to power after Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, and was consequently overthrown in a military coup, abdicated and ultimately exiled to France. The National Assembly, known as the Majlis, convening as a constituent assembly on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Shah the new monarch of the Imperial State of Persia. In 1935, Reza Shah instructed foreign embassies to call Persia by its ancient name, Iran.
Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the dissolution of the Imperial State on 11 February 1979, officially ending the 2500-year old tradition of monarchy in Iran.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013[/tpl]

In some schools,[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl] truancy may result in not being able to graduate or to receive credit for class attended, until the time lost to truancy is made up through a combination of detention, fines, or summer school.
Truancy is a frequent subject of popular culture; perhaps most famously Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which is entirely about the titular character's (played by Matthew Broderick) day of truancy in Chicago with his girlfriend and best friend. Truancy is also the title of a 2008 novel about a student uprising against a dictatorial educational system.

[[Meditrinalia]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman festivals, October observances

In Roman religion, Meditrinalia was an obscure festival celebrated on October 11 in honor of the new vintage, which was offered as libations to the gods for the first time each year. The festival may have been so called from medendo, because the Romans then began to drink new wine, which they mixed with old and which served them instead of physic.
Little information about the Meditrinalia survived from early Roman religion, although the tradition itself did. It was known to be somehow connected to Jupiter and to have been an important ceremony in early agricultural Rome, but beyond that, only speculation exists.
Meditrina was a Roman goddess who seems to have been a late Roman invention to account for the origin of Meditrinalia. The earliest account of associating the Meditrinalia with such a goddess was by 2nd century grammarian Sextus Pompeius Festus, on the basis of which she is asserted by modern sources to be the Roman goddess of health, longevity and wine, with an etymological meaning of "healer" suggested by some.

Dating Do's and Don'tsSome prescriptive grammarians today, such as Paul Brians, would call this spelling incorrect, arguing that the apostrophe denotes a possessive; if the film were made today, the title would probably be Dating Dos and Don'ts. However, "do's" is the more traditional spelling, and was the recommended spelling at the time the film was made. The Merriam-Webster web site lists do's as an acceptable variant is a 1949 instructional film designed for American high schools, to teach adolescents basic dating skills, produced by Coronet Instructional Films and directed by Gilbert Altschul with the assistance of Reuben Hill, Research Professor of Family Life at the University of North Carolina. In this film, the boy is the sole initiator of any contact with the girl, and all arrangements are made under the warm supervision of the family, particularly a mother who is a matriarchal housewife.

The White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&Y, WP&YR) [tpl]Reporting mark|WPY[/tpl] is a Canadian and U.S. Class II [tpl]RailGauge|3ft[/tpl] narrow gauge railroad linking the port of Skagway, Alaska, with Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon. An isolated system, it has no direct connection to any other railroad. Equipment, freight and passengers are ferried by ship through the Port of Skagway, and via road through a few of the stops along its route.
The railroad began construction in 1898 during the Klondike Gold Rush as a means of reaching the goldfields. With its completion in 1900, it became the primary route to the interior of the Yukon, supplanting the Chilkoot Trail and other routes. The route continued operation until 1982, and in 1988 was partially revived as a heritage railway.
Today, the railroad is a subsidiary of Clublink and operated by the Pacific and Arctic Railway and Navigation Company (in Alaska), the British Columbia Yukon Railway Company (in British Columbia) and the British Yukon Railway Company, originally known as the British Yukon Mining, Trading and Transportation Company (in Yukon), which use the trade name White Pass and Yukon Route.

The battle was the largest and most important event of the War of the Ring, the war in which the Third Age of Middle-earth comes to a close. It takes place on 15 March, T.A. 3019 in the Pelennor Fields, the townlands and fields between Minas Tirith and the River Anduin. The concept and history of composition of the battle is detailed in the fourth volume of The History of the Lord of the Rings.

[[Vickers VC10]]

CATEGORIES: British airliners 1960–1969, Vickers aircraft, Quadjets

The  Vickers VC10 is a long-range British airliner designed and built by Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd, and first flown at Brooklands, Surrey, in 1962. The airliner was designed to operate on long-distance routes from the shorter runways of the era, and demanded excellent hot and high performance for operations from African airports. The performance of the VC10 was such that it achieved the fastest London to New York crossing of the Atlantic by a jet airliner, a record still held to date for a sub-sonic airliner; only the supersonic Concorde was faster. The VC10 is often compared to the larger Soviet Ilyushin Il-62, both aircraft having a rear-engined quad layout, the two types being the only airliners with such a configuration (a configuration that they shared with the earlier, but smaller Lockheed JetStar).
Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built, they provided long service with BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981. They were also used from 1965 as strategic air lifters for the Royal Air Force, and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft. The 50th anniversary of the first flight of the prototype VC10, G-ARTA, was celebrated with a 'VC10 Retrospective' Symposium and the official opening of a VC10 exhibition at Brooklands Museum on 29 June 2012. The type was retired from RAF service on 20 September 2013. It has been succeeded in the aerial refuelling role by the Airbus A330 MRTT.

The World Set Free is a novel written in 1913 and published in 1914 by H. G. Wells.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 83-85.  According to Smith, Wells wrote The World Set Free at the château of his mistress, Elizabeth von Arnim, dubbed "Soleil" ('Sun'), in Randogne, Switzerland. The book is based on a prediction of nuclear weapons of a more destructive and uncontrollable sort than the world has yet seen.[tpl]cite book|last=Dyson|first=George |title=Project Orion|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|pages=10|isbn=978-0-8050-5985-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4S2KocYp8AkC&pg=PA10[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Flynn|first=John L.|title=War of the Worlds|publisher=Galactic Books|year=2005|pages=14|isbn=978-0-9769400-0-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T0aCSs1-23sC&pg=PA14[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Parrinder|title=H.G.

A frequent theme of Wells's work, as in his 1901 nonfiction book Anticipations, was the history of humans' mastery of power and energy through technological advance, seen as a determinant of human progress. The novel begins: "The history of mankind is the history of the attainment of external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making animal. . . . Always down a lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and again, he is doing more."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), p. 15 ("Prelude: The Sun Snarers," §1). (Many of the ideas Wells develops here found a fuller development when he wrote The Outline of History in 1918-1919.)  The novel is dedicated "To Frederick Soddy's Interpretation of Radium," a volume published in 1909.
Scientists of the time were well aware that the slow natural radioactive decay of elements like radium continues for thousands of years, and that while the rate of energy release is negligible, the total amount released is huge. Wells used this as the basis for his story.
In his fiction,
Wells's knowledge of atomic physics came from reading William Ramsay, Ernest Rutherford, and Frederick Soddy; the latter discovered the disintegration of uranium.  Soddy's book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt praises The World Set Free.  Wells's novel may even have influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leó Szilárd read the book in 1932, the same year the neutron was discovered.  In 1933 Szilárd conceived the idea of neutron chain reaction, and filed for patents on it in 1934.[tpl]cite book | author = Richard Rhodes | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | pages = 24 | isbn = 0-684-81378-5[/tpl]  In a volume published in 1968, Szilard wrote: "Knowing what chain reaction would mean—and I knew because I had read H.G. Wells—I did not want this patent to become public."  Quoted in Norman and Jeanne MacKenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 299.
Wells's "atomic bombs" have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a "bomb-thrower" biting off "a little celluloid stud."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), pp. 106-07 ("Chapter the Second: The Last War," §3).  They consist of "lumps of pure Carolinum" that induce "a blazing continual explosion" whose half-life is seventeen days, so that it is "never entirely exhausted," so that "to this day the battle-fields and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), pp. 108-09 ("Chapter the Second: The Last War," §4).
Wells observes: 
Wells viewed war as the inevitable result of the Modern State; the introduction of atomic energy in a world divided resulted in the collapse of society. The only possibilities remaining were "either the relapse of mankind to agricultural barbarism from which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the basis of a new social order."  Wells's theme of world government is presented as a solution to the threat of nuclear weapons.
The devastation of the war leads the French ambassador at Washington, Leblanc, to summon world leaders to a conference at Brissago, where Britain's "King Egbert" sets an example by abdicating in favor of a world state.  Such is the state of the world's exhaustion that the effective coup of this "council" ("Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government.  It was of an extravagant illegality."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), p. 223 ("Chapter the Fourth: The New Phase," §9).) is resisted only in a few places.  The defeat of Serbia's "King Ferdinand Charles" and his attempt to destroy the council and seize control of the world is narrated in some detail.H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), pp. 171-92 ("Chapter the Third: The Ending of War," §§6-8).
Brought to its senses, humanity creates a utopian order along Wellsian lines in short order.  Atomic energy has solved the problem of work.  In the new order "the majority of our population consists of artists."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), p. 229 ("Chapter the Fourth: The New Phase," §10).  
The World Set Free concludes with a chapter recounting the reflections of one of the new order's sages, Marcus Karenin, during his last days.  Karenin argues that knowledge and power, not love, are the essential vocation of humanity, and that "There is no absolute limit to either knowledge or power."H.G. Wells, The World Set Free (London: W. Collins Sons, 1924), p. 275 ("Chapter the Fifth: Last Days of Marcus Karenin," §8).

In 2002, Paksas founded the Liberal Democratic Party, and ran for the presidency, winning the run-off against incumbent Valdas Adamkus in January 2003. It emerged that he had granted citizenship to a major campaign donor, leading to his impeachment and removal from office in April 2004.

[[Third rail]]

CATEGORIES: Electric power distribution, Electric rail transport

A third rail is a method of providing electric power to a railway train, through a semi-continuous rigid conductor placed alongside or between the rails of a railway track. It is used typically in a mass transit or rapid transit system, which has alignments in its own corridors, fully or almost fully segregated from the outside environment. Third rail systems are always supplied from direct current electricity.
The third-rail system of electrification is unrelated to the third rail used in dual-gauge railways.

[[Wing loading]]

CATEGORIES: Aerodynamics

In aerodynamics, wing loading is the loaded weight of the aircraft divided by the area of the wing.Thom, 1988. p. 6. The faster an aircraft flies, the more lift is produced by each unit area of wing, so a smaller wing can carry the same weight in level flight, operating at a higher wing loading.  Correspondingly, the landing and take-off speeds will be higher.  The high wing loading also decreases maneuverability.  The same constraints apply to winged biological organisms.

Business performance management is a set of management and analytic processes that enables the management of an organization's performance to achieve one or more pre-selected goals. Synonyms for "business performance management" include "corporate performance management (CPM)""Introducing the CPM Suites Magic Quadrant", Lee Geishecker and Frank Buytendijk, 2 October 2002, www.gartner.com, M-17-4718 and "enterprise performance management".
Business performance management is contained within approaches to business process management.vom Brocke, J. & Rosemann, M. (2010), Handbook on Business Process Management: Strategic Alignment, Governance, People and Culture (International Handbooks on Information Systems). Berlin: Springer
Business performance management has three main activities:
Although presented here sequentially, typically all three activities will run concurrently, with interventions by managers affecting the choice of goals, the measurement information monitored, and the activities being undertaken by the organization.
Because business performance management activities in large organizations often involve the collation and reporting of large volumes of data, many software vendors, particularly those offering business intelligence tools, market products intended to assist in this process.  As a result of this marketing effort, business performance management is often incorrectly understood as an activity that necessarily relies on software systems to work, and many definitions of business performance management explicitly suggest software as being a definitive component of the approach.[ref]BPM Mag, What is BPM?
[/ref]
This interest in business performance management from the software community is sales-driven[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] - "The biggest growth area in operational BI analysis is in the area of business performance management."
Since 1992, business performance management has been strongly influenced by the rise of the balanced scorecard framework.  It is common for managers to use the balanced scorecard framework to clarify the goals of an organization, to identify how to track them, and to structure the mechanisms by which interventions will be triggered.  These steps are the same as those that are found in BPM, and as a result balanced scorecard is often used as the basis for business performance management activity with organizations.[tpl]Citation needed|date = September 2010[/tpl]

The Socialist Labour Party (SLP) was a minor political party in the Republic of Ireland formed under the leadership of Matt Merrigan (Dublin Secretary of the ATGWU) and Noël Browne, TD in 1977. Another key figure was the radical journalist Brian Trench, now head of the Communications Department at Dublin City University along with the former Clann na Poblachta TD Jack McQuillan. The founders came from the Liaison Committee of the Labour Left, which in 1975/76 had tried to build the "Left Alternative",Goodwillie, John (Aug/Sept 1983). "Glossary of the Left in Ireland". Gralton: an Irish Socialist Review 9: 17-20. a coalition of progressive organisations and individuals, aimed at addressing what they saw as the cultural and economic impoverishment of Irish society by the establishment parties of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. 
The SLP regarded itself as highly progressive. It allowed for the right of factions to organise within the Party.  The most notable were the Socialist Workers Tendency, organised around members of the Socialist Workers' Movement which left in 1980, the Workers Alliance for Action organised around members of the Irish Workers' Group which left in 1979 and the Republican Socialist Tendency, organised around members of People's Democracy, which also left in 1979.
In the 1981 general election the party fielded 7 candidates, with Noël Browne elected for Dublin North–Central. Following a continuing decline in membership, the SLP was dissolved in 1982.

The Vickers Vanguard was a British short/medium-range turboprop airliner introduced in 1959 by Vickers-Armstrongs, a development of their successful Viscount design with considerably more internal room. The Vanguard was introduced just before the first of the large jet-powered airliners, and was largely ignored by the market. Only 44 were built, ordered by Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) and British European Airways (BEA).
After only about 10 years service TCA experimentally converted one of theirs to a freighter configuration, calling it the Cargoliner. This was considered successful, and in the early 1970s most were converted to freighters, those from BEA becoming the Merchantman. These freighters remained in service for many years, with the last one (G-APEP) only retiring in 1996.

The Labor Party was an American social democratic political party advocating workers' interests. Membership at one point reached about 5,000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
The party was formed in 1996 by the United Mine Workers, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, American Federation of Government Employees, California Nurses Association, and hundreds of other local labor unions. From the beginning a dispute over the Party's running of candidates arose with many of the official unions totally opposed to running candidates that might cause the defeat of their normal Democratic allies. Smaller locals and left union activists on the other had pushed for a clean break with the Democratic Party. This issue was debated internally for years until 1999 when the Party's leadership agreed to some endorsements of Labor Party members running. In 2001 the Labor Party endorsed labor sponsored independent candidates in San Francisco and Ohio local elections. After the 2000 elections even symbolic support dripped away. The future of the party remains uncertain, particularly after the 2002 death of Tony Mazzocchi, the founding national organizer. All of the founding unions continued to actively support Democratic Party candidates.
In December 2005, the South Carolina Labor Party announced that it would seek ballot status in South Carolina and run a candidate in the 2006 legislative elections.  Labor Party News quoted Leonard Riley, President of the Charleston International Longshoremen's Association Local 1422 as saying, "Given the results of the past few elections, I think the workers of South Carolina would jump at the opportunity to consider a Labor Party which would guarantee an uncompromising voice for working people on their issues."http://www.thelaborparty.org/n_1205.pdf Although South Carolina law permitted electoral fusion, the Labor Party pledged not to endorse candidates of any other party.
Party officials acknowledged that the choice of South Carolina may seem unusual.  The state has the second lowest concentration of union workers in the United States.  However, party officials said that the relatively high unemployment rate, the decline in the textile industry, and the indifference of the state Democratic and Republican parties to the interests of working people, African-Americans and women created a political space for the Labor Party.Labor Party The party submitted 16,500 signatures on July 11, 2006. If 10,000 of the signatures were valid, the party would be qualified for the 2007 and 2008 elections.http://www.ballot-access.org/2006/080106.html#16 Labor Party launches petition drive to gain ballot access, South Carolina Times and Democrat, Orangeburg, S.C. This effort was apparently unrelated to the concurrent attempt of the Working Families Party to gain ballot access in South Carolina, a state that allows electoral fusion.Ballot Access News » Blog Archive » South Carolina Working Families Party Will Sue to Get on 2006 Ballot In July 2007 Ballot Access News reported that the SCLP was attempting to recruit candidates."South Carolina Labor Party Recruiting Candidates"
The party suspended active operations in 2007 but a group said to affiliated with the party nominated one candidate for the South Carolina State House for 2010. The candidate, Brett Bursey, received 442 votes, or 3.06%.http://www.scvotes.org/files/2010%20Convention%20Party%20Candidates.pdf
In December 2012 Mark Dudzic wrote an article in which he said confirmed that the party had suspended operations in 2007. While some have taken this to mean that he said that the time was currently not right for the Labor Party to exist, others have seen this as a start of a discussion about the future of the Labor Party."Labor Party Time?

[[Length contraction]]
CATEGORIES: Special relativity, History of physics, Length

In physics, length contraction is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by an observer of objects which are traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction (more formally called Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction after Hendrik Lorentz and George FitzGerald) is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Length contraction is only in the direction parallel to the direction in which the observed body is travelling. This effect is negligible at everyday speeds, and can be ignored for all regular purposes. Only at greater speeds does it become relevant. At a speed of 13,400,000 m/s (30 million mph, 0.0447[tpl]math|c[/tpl]), the contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of 42,300,000 m/s (95 million mph, 0.141[tpl]math|c[/tpl]), the length is still 99%. As the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light, the effect becomes dominant, as can be seen from the formula:
where
and the Lorentz factor, [tpl]math|γ(v)[/tpl], is defined as
In this equation it is assumed that the object is parallel with its line of movement. For the observer in relative movement, the length of the object is measured by subtracting the simultaneously measured distances of both ends of the object. For more general conversions, see the Lorentz transformations. An observer at rest viewing an object travelling very close to the speed of light would observe the length of the object in the direction of motion as very near zero.

The term boot refers to a family of instruments of torture and interrogation variously designed to cause crushing injuries to the foot and/or leg. The boot has taken many forms in various places and times. Common varieties include the Spanish boot and the Malay boot. One type was made of four pieces of narrow wooden board nailed together. The boards were measured to fit the victim's leg. Once the leg was enclosed, wedges would be hammered between the boards, creating pressure. The pressure would be increased until the victim confessed or lost consciousness. Newer variants have included iron visessometimes armed with spikesthat squeezed feet and metal frames employed red-hot.

The [tpl]Nihongo|Democratic Party of Japan|民主党|Minshutō[/tpl] is a centrist[ref]The Democratic Party of Japan is widely described as centrist:
After winning a landslide victory in 2009, it was ousted from government by the LDP in the 2012 general election. It retained 57 seats in the lower house, and still had 88 seats in the upper house. During its time in office, the DPJ was beset by internal conflicts and struggled to implement many of its proposed policies, an outcome described by political scientists as the "paradox of political change without policy change."Phillip Y. Lipscy and Ethan Scheiner. 2012. "Japan under the DPJ: The Paradox of Political Change without Policy Change." Journal of East Asian Studies 12(3): 311-322. Legislative productivity under the DPJ was particularly low, falling to levels unprecedented in recent Japanese history according to some measures.Kenji E. Kushida and Phillip Y. Lipscy. 2013. "The Rise and Fall of the Democratic Party of Japan." in Kenji E. Kushida and Phillip Y. Lipscy eds. Japan Under the DPJ: The Politics of Transition and Governance. Stanford: Brookings/Walter H. Shorenstein Asia Pacific Research Center. However, the DPJ implemented a number of progressive measures such as the provision of free public schooling through high school and increases in child-rearing subsidies.Japan in Transformation, 1945-2010 (2nd edition) by Jeff Kingston
It is not to be confused with the now-defunct Japan Democratic Party that merged with the Liberal Party in 1955 to form the Liberal Democratic Party. It is also different from another Democratic Party, which was established in 1947 and dissolved in 1950.
