[[Šventoji, Lithuania]]

CATEGORIES: Seaside resorts in Lithuania, Palanga city municipality

Šventoji (Latvian: Sventāja; German: Heiligenau) is a small resort town on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Lithuania. Administratively it is part of Palanga city. The town is located about 10 km north of Palanga and close to the border with Latvia. Further north of the town is Būtingė and its oil terminal. Šventoji River flows into the sea at the town. 
Šventoji is an important archaeological site as the first artifacts are dated about 3000 BC. A famous cane shaped as moose head was also found in the town. It is a former fishermen village now turned into a tourist town. The town always struggled to develop a port, which had to compete with nearby Klaipėda and Liepāja. Larger port was constructed in the second half of the 17th century, especially when in 1679 it was leased to English merchants. It was destroyed in 1701 during the Great Northern War. During the times of the Russian Empire (1795–1915) the port was moribund and began developing again only when it became part of Lithuania in 1921. Two piers were constructed, but they were frequently covered in sand. Thus it never grew into a bigger port, although it briefly became vital to Lithuania in the brief period between when it lost control of Klaipėda, and when it was incorporated into the Soviet Union.

[[United States presidential election in Massachusetts, 1972]]

CATEGORIES: United States presidential election, 1972, United States presidential elections in Massachusetts, Massachusetts elections, 1972

The 1972 United States presidential election in Massachusetts took place on November 7, 1972 as part of the 1972 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all 50 states and D.C. Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Massachusetts voted for the Democratic nominee, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, over incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon of California. McGovern's running mate was U.S. Ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland, who had replaced Senator Thomas Eagleton during the campaign, while Nixon ran with incumbent Vice President Spiro Agnew of Maryland.
McGovern carried Massachusetts with 54.20% of the vote to Nixon's 45.23%, a Democratic victory margin of 8.97%. 
In the midst of a massive nationwide Republican landslide in which Richard Nixon had carried 49 states, Massachusetts proved to be the only state in the nation that would cast its electoral votes for George McGovern, joined only by the District of Columbia. 
McGovern also carried the state by a surprisingly comfortable 9 point margin, making the state a whopping 32% more Democratic than the national average in the 1972 election. 
McGovern, a staunch liberal Democrat best known for his strong principled opposition to the Vietnam War, was painted by the Nixon campaign as an extremist too far to the left of the American mainstream at the time, and this paid off in delivering Nixon a nationwide re-election landslide. 
However liberal Massachusetts would prove to be the one state that was immune to the Nixon campaign's rhetoric. 
Prior to 1972, Massachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, and a Democratic stronghold since 1960. But McGovern's comfortable victory in 1972 still stands out, as many other traditional Democratic strongholds abandoned the Democrats in 1972. For example, neighboring Rhode Island, which normally voted similarly to Massachusetts, went to Nixon in 1972 by 6 points. 
On the county map, McGovern carried nine of the state's 14 counties, including the most heavily populated parts of the state. The state's capital and largest city, Boston, would prove to be a McGovern stronghold; Suffolk County, where Boston is located, went to McGovern with 66% of the vote. Boston is one of the few areas in the country where McGovern actually outperformed Jimmy Carter's performance four years later in 1976; while Carter was narrowly winning the presidency nationally, in Suffolk County he only took 61%. 
The results in 1972 made Massachusetts the only state which Richard Nixon would never carry in any of his three presidential campaigns.

[[12th Malaysian Parliament]]
CATEGORIES: Parliaments of Malaysia

The 12th Malaysian Parliament is the last meeting of the legislative branch of the government of Malaysia, the Parliament, comprising the directly elected lower house, the Dewan Rakyat, and the appointed upper house, the Dewan Negara. It met for the first time at the Malaysian Houses of Parliament on 28 April 2008 and met for the last time on 29 November 2012. The King then dissolved the Parliament on 3 April 2013. The dissolution was announced by the Prime Minister Najib Razak after it consented by the King.[tpl]cite news|last=G|first=Manimaran|title=Parlimen dibubar, buka laluan bagi PRU13|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/nasional/parlimen-dibubar-buka-laluan-bagi-pru13-1.145681|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Sinar Harian|date=3 April 2013|language=Malay[/tpl] 
The 12th Parliament was the first to meet where the governing Barisan Nasional coalition does not have a 2/3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat necessary to amend the Constitution. In the 2008 general election, opposition parties won a record 82 of the 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat, quadrupling the share they held previously. On 1 April, leaders from Parti Keadilan Rakyat, the Democratic Action Party and PAS announced the formation of the Pakatan Rakyat, a coalition comprising the three main opposition parties in Parliament. They also announced that Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, would be the new Leader of the Opposition, making her the first woman to assume the post. The 12th Parliament was also the first to have regular live broadcasts of Dewan Rakyat debates on national public television, and saw the first instance of a supply bill approved by division instead of a voice vote. In June 2008, the two members of parliament from the Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP, a BN component party) announced they would be filing a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister, a first in Malaysian Parliamentary history.

[[Sustainable biofuel]]
CATEGORIES: Biofuels, Sustainable transport, Sustainable agriculture, Sustainable development

Biofuels, in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use.
The challenge is to support biofuel development, including the development of new cellulosic technologies, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.The Royal Society (January 2008). Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges,  ISBN 978-0-85403-662-2, p. 61.Gordon Quaiattini. Biofuels are part of the solution Canada.com, April 25, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2009.EPFL Energy Center (c2007). Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels Retrieved December 23, 2009.
Biofuels offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.

[[Spring pendulum]]

CATEGORIES: Pendulums

A spring pendulum is a physical system where a piece of mass is connected to a spring so that the resulting motion contains elements of a simple pendulum as well as a spring.  The system is much more complex than a simple pendulum, as the properties of the spring add an extra dimension of freedom to the system.  For example, when the spring compresses, the shorter radius causes the spring to move faster due to the conservation of angular momentum.  It is also possible that the spring has a range that is overtaken by the motion of the pendulum, making it practically neutral to the motion of the pendulum.

[[Flame Queen Opal]]
CATEGORIES: Named opals

The Flame Queen Opal is perhaps the most famous of all opals.Leechman, F: “The Opal Book”, page 198. Ure Smith, 1961 It is the best-known example of “eye-of-opal”, an eye-like effect created when opal in-fills a cavity.O’Leary, B: “Field guide to Australian Opals”. Antique Collectors Club Ltd, 1984 
The Flame Queen’s flat central raised dome flashes red or gold depending on the angle of view, and is surrounded by a band of deep blue-green, giving the stone an appearance somewhat like that of a fried egg. The Flame Queen weighs [tpl]convert|263.18|carat|g[/tpl] and is somewhat triangular in shape, measuring 7.0 x 6.3 x 1.2 centimeters (2.75 x 2.50 x .50 inches). 
The Flame Queen was discovered in 1914 by three partners: Jack Philips, Walter Bradley and “Irish” Joe Hegarty, at the Bald Hill Workings, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. 
Tunneling down at around [tpl]convert|30|ft|m[/tpl] revealed no trace of the tell-tale coloring in the clay that indicates the likely presence of opal. However, despite the poor ventilation and the constant danger of tunnel collapse, Bradley and Philips wanted to continue digging. At [tpl]convert|35|ft|m[/tpl], Bradley’s pick found a large, black opal nodule. It was not until they reached the surface that the true nature of their find was revealed.Leechman, F: "The Opal Book", page 199. Ure Smith, 1961
Bradley was the most skilled lapidary, and he was entrusted to cut and polish the great stone. By this time the partners were tired and broke;Eyles, C: “The Book of Opals”, page 95. Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1964 they sold the Flame Queen for just £93.Leechman, F: “The Opal Book”, page 200. Ure Smith, 1961
The Flame Queen was exhibited at the Geological museum, London, in 1937 on the occasion of the Coronation of King George VI and again at the Gemological Institute, London, in 1980-81. At one time it was a part of the renowned Kelsey I. Newman Collection, and more recently the Jack Plane Collection.

A member of an aristocratic family from County Westmeath, he obtained a mostly Roman Catholic childhood education before, in his twenties, moving to Iberia and entering the Dominican Order. After many years promoting the revitalisation of the Order in Ireland, from Ireland and Continental Europe, he was considered unsuccessfully for the archbishopric of Armagh in 1625 and then successfully for the bishopric of Kildare in 1629. After a dozen years as bishop, his health slowly declined and he died in 1644.

South Dakota was the home state of George McGovern, the Democratic Party nominee in the 1972 United States presidential election.
Although McGovern, a member of the liberal wing of his party in relatively conservative state, was at the time of the election a popular two-term Senator, having won re-election in 1968 with 56.8% of the vote, he lost the presidential vote here by a significant margin to incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon.
McGovern's loss of South Dakota made him the second candidate in four years to lose his state of birth (in 1968 Hubert Humphrey also lost South Dakota, where he was born) and residence (also in 1968 Richard Nixon lost New York, where he then resided). McGovern remained the last candidate to lose his state of residence until 2000, when Al Gore lost Tennessee.

CATEGORIES: 1968 songs, The Moody Blues songs, Songs written by Ray Thomas

"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume" is a 1968 song by the English rock band The Moody Blues.  It was written by the band's flautist Ray Thomas, although he does not play the flute in this particular song.  First released in June 1968 on the B-side of "Voices in the Sky," "Dr. Livingstone, I Presume" is one of Ray Thomas's signature child-themed songs, much like his first composition "Another Morning."
"Dr Livingstone, I Presume" was primarily written about Dr. David Livingstone.  The lyrics in the opening verse describe the accomplishments of Dr. Livingstone, who was a Scottish missionary and explorer in central Africa.  In a similar manner, the lyrics in later verses describe the accomplishments of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, and Christopher Columbus.
"Dr. Livingstone, I Presume" was later released on the Moody Blues' 1968 album In Search of the Lost Chord, where it was the third track.
The chorus, with the repeated line "We're all looking for someone", was used in the title sequence of the 1968 Thames Television series "The Tyrant King", in which a trio of children follow a mysterious character around London.

Baron Saverio Fava (1832–1913) was known for his founding of the Italian Ministry in Washington, D.C.. He served as the first Italian Ambassador of the then recently unified Italy to the United States from 1881-1893.[tpl]cite book|last=Gray|first=Robert M.|title=Amy Heard Letters from the Gilded Age|year=2005|url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~gray/amy.pdf|accessdate=19 December 2011|page=22[/tpl] 
As Ambassador, Baron Fava served as the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. Prior to his service for Italy in the United States of America, Baron Fava served in Brazil and Romania. He began his career under the House of Bourbon governments of Italy but as Italian unity formed under Garibaldi, he continued to serve Italian interests under the Savoy.
His greatest challenge as US ambassador consisted of the "New Orleans Affair" in which eleven Italians were lynched by a New Orleans mob on 15 Mar 1891. Lodging a protest with Secretary or State James Blaine and eventually negotiating directly with President Benjamin Harrison, the Baron requested federal action to address a lynching of the eleven Italian citizens being managed as a State of Louisiana criminal event.[tpl]cite news|title=Baron Fava's Protest|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D0DE3D61F3BE533A2575AC1A9659C94609ED7CF|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 March 1891[/tpl]  Several Italians were lynched in a New Orleans jail after being falsely accused of a murder.[tpl]cite web|last=Haas|first=Edward|title=Guns, Goats, and Italians|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lamadiso/articles/lynchings.htm|accessdate=19 December 2011[/tpl]  The local and state government failed to act in a test of federal treaties.

Cestrum parqui, commonly known as green cestrum, green poison berry, Chilean cestrum or willow-leaved jessamine, and is sometimes incorrectly referred to as deadly nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the family Solanaceae that is native to central and South America.
It is an upright, straggly, woody deciduous or semi-evergreen shrub [tpl]convert|2|-|3|m|0[/tpl] tall with one or more brittle green stems. Light green leaves are alternate and shiny green to [tpl]convert|12|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, giving off a foul rubbery smell when crushed. It has sprays of small, fragrant, tubular yellow-green flowers approximately 2.5 cm long on the ends of the stems, flowering from late spring to autumn.Auld, R A & Medd, R W, Weeds, Inkata Press, Sydney, 1992 These produce clusters of small, black egg shaped berries during summer to autumn.[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl]
Green cestrum is highly attractive to birds, and seedlings are often found growing under perching trees, along fence lines and on creek banks. It is also dispersed by water.
Spread by birds, it invades gardens, rural lands and bushland. It has a deep and persistent taproot. This weed is considered a major problem because of its toxicity to livestock (especially cattle) and poultry which eat green cestrum when there is a shortage of other feed.Farming Small Areas, p. 17, "Vigorous toxic threat", Rural Press, North Richmond, April 2009 All parts of the plant material, stems, leaves, berries and even partly burnt roots pose a serious threat to livestock."Country Leader", Northern Daily Leader, Tamworth, 5 May 2008, Death is usually rapid and painful. The plant is also known to be toxic to other livestock and humans. 
This species is defined as a noxious plant in New South Wales under the Noxious Weeds Act, 1993 and all plants must be destroyed.
In cultivation in the United Kingdom, this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2303

Lucas de Tuy (or el Tudense) (died 1249) was a Leonese cleric and intellectual, remembered best as a historian. He was Bishop of Tuy from 1239 until his death. 
Born in León, Lucas was a canon of San Isidoro there between 1221 and 1239. While a canon he wrote De Miraculis Sancti Isidori in defence of Isidore of Seville. He also travelled extensively: to Rome, Constantinople, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Armenia, and France. He visited all four of the Holy Nails: in France, Constantinople, Nazareth, and Tarsus. In 1233 or 1234 he passed Easter in Rome and completed his tract De altera vita fideique controversiis adverus Albigensium errores against the Cathars, taking inspiration mainly from Isidore and Jerome. 
In 1236, upon a request from Queen Berenguela, he composed the Chronicon mundi, a four-part chronicle of world history and his magnum opus. Beginning with Creation and ending in 1236, the Chronicon aspired to give comprehensive coverage to two topics: the world and the Spains. Lucas' principal sources are Isidore, John of Biclar, Hydatius, Osorio, the Chronicle of Alfonso III, the Crónica Silense, and Sampiro. Lucas does contain a few historical titbits which are found nowhere else, but he is not generally regarded as reliable in this regard. 
In 1239 he was made bishop of Tuy, and there he died ten years thence.

Jorge Gianonni (1939 — 1995) was an independent Argentine filmmaker. 
One of the milestones of his career on film was his collaboration in Raymundo Gleyzer’s La tierra quema, shot in Northeastern Brazil; also in Brazil, he collaborated with Glauber Rocha in his Terra em transe (Land in Anguish). Gianonni studied at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, and worked next to Federico Fellini in his film Roma. As a RAI correspondent in Paris, Gianonni witnessed the events of May 1968. Within that context he concluded his avant-garde underground film Molotov Party, of which no copies survived. He also produced and directed Palestina, otro Vietnam (Palestine, another Vietnam) and Las vacas sagradas (The Sacred Cows), an anti-government film denouncing the economic policies of the Argentine dictatorship of General Juan Carlos Onganía.La Fuga: Revista de Cine. Entre Argel y Buenos Aires. [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
Within a context of great political agitation, Giannoni returned to Argentina in 1974. In Buenos Aires, he created the Instituto de Cine del Tercer Mundo (Third World Film Institute), which was then merged with Raymundo Gleyzer’s Cine de la Base (Cinema of the People). Shortly thereafter the University of Buenos Aires was pressured by the government of Isabel Perón to close the Institute, and he had to leave the country for Peru, and then Cuba, where he resided until his return to Argentina in 1983. Gianonni died in Buenos Aires in 1995.
Director Gabriela Jaime made a documentary of the independent filmmaker, Jorge Giannoni, NN, ese soy yo (Giannoni: No Name, That's Me), in 2000.Cine Nacional

He earned his nickname of "Action" because it was slang for "Juice Man", which meant debt-collector. He was tortured to death by his fellow gangsters, allegedly on suspicion that he had become an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

He was born in Frolovo in southwest Russia.
According to the Mitrokhin Archive, which claimed deep Communist penetration of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Nikodim was a KGB agent, working under the codename "Adamant", whose ecumenical activity with the Roman Catholic Church and the World Council of Churches (WCC) served to further Soviet goals.  Ordained in 1960 at the age of 31, the youngest bishop in the Christian world at the time, he would go on to become one of the WCC's six presidents.Weigel, George.

The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB. New York: Basic Books, 2001. pg. 487.
Metropolitan Nikodim is said to have participated in negotiating a secret 1960s agreement between Soviet and Vatican officials that authorized Eastern Orthodox participation in the Second Vatican Council in exchange for non-condemnation of atheistic communism during the conciliar assemblies.Chiron, Yves, Paul VI: Le pape écartelé, Perrin, Paris, 1993 ISBN 2-262-00952-X p. 186 and 246Interview with Paul-Joseph Schmitt, Archbishop of Metz, in Le Lorrain, 9 March 1963 [tpl]dubious|date=August 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: National Trust properties in Cumbria, Individual yachts, 1859 ships, Steam yachts, Coniston

The steam yacht Gondola is a rebuilt Victorian, screw-propelled, steam-powered passenger vessel on Coniston Water, England. Originally launched in 1859, she was built for the steamer service carrying passengers from the Furness Railway and from the Coniston Railway. She was in commercial service until 1936 when she was retired, being converted to a houseboat in 1946. In 1979, by now derelict, she was given a new hull, engine, boiler and most of the superstructure. She is back in service as a passenger boat, still powered by steam and now operated by the National Trust.
Gondola is one of the inspirations for Captain Flint's houseboat in Arthur Ransome's book Swallows and Amazons. In Coniston's Ruskin Museum there is a black and white post card of Gondola that Ransome sent to his illustrator, with changes to the outline in ink to show how he wanted the houseboat to look.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/amb/gondola.htm|title='Coniston - Steam Yacht Gondola'|publisher=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=2008-05-04[/tpl]

A Heavenly Vintage is a film directed and co-written by New Zealand filmmaker Niki Caro. Originally titled "The Vintner's Luck", it is loosely based on the novel The Vintner's Luck by New Zealander Elizabeth Knox and had its international première at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009. This is the second time Caro has worked with New Zealand actress  Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was nominated for an Academy Award at age 13 for her role in Caro's international breakthrough Whale Rider in 2002. 
Elizabeth Knox, the writer of the book, was disappointed at the direction the movie took as she felt Niki Caro "took out what the book was actually about", referring to the romantic relationship between Sobran and Xas which was a core aspect of the novel and was very noticeably toned down in the movie, even though it still hints at it.
Co- writer Joan Scheckel previously collaborated with director Niki Caro on her award-winning film Whale Rider.

[[23rd Army (Soviet Union)]]

CATEGORIES: Field armies of the Soviet Union, Military units and formations established in 1941, Military units and formations disestablished in 1957, Karelian Isthmus

The 23rd Army was a Field Army of the Soviet Union's Red Army. It was formed in May 1941 in the Leningrad Military District for the defence of the southernmost part of the Soviet Union's border with Finland, north and northeast of Vyborg. Soviet 7th Army was located on its right side.
The Army initially included the 19th and 50th Rifle Corps, the 10th Mechanized Corps (which included the 21st Tank Division, the 24th Tank Division and the 198th Mechanised Division), the 27th Vyborg Fortified Region, the 28th Keksgolm Fortified Region, plus artillery and other units.
On 24 June the Army was included in the Northern Front. At the beginning of 10 July Mechanised Corps was removed from the Army. From 31 July to the end of August when facing Finnish offensive, it was unable to stop the Finns reconquering the Karelian Isthmus, and thus the Army fell back to the old border line and occupied positions in the 22nd Karelian Fortified Region.
Due to a reorganisation, the army was transferred to the Leningrad Front on 24 August. The 23rd Army had suffered enormous losses in battles against Finns in July–August 1941. When Finnish army halted offense by command of field marshal Mannerheim on 1 September, the army consisted of only 80 000-90 000 men and had lost huge amounts of heavy weapons and material to the Finns. If Finns hadn't halted attack and continued moving towards Leningrad, the 23rd Army probably would have had to withdraw to the city of Leningrad.

Before the start of the World Championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selected fewer than the maximum allowed, they had to choose the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once a player was registered to the team, he could not be removed from the roster.
To qualify for a national team under IIHF rules, a player must follow several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national ice hockey association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player would have had to play two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country, without playing in another nation. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch nationality if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may only happen once in the player's life.

CATEGORIES: Experimental string instruments, Hurdy-gurdies

The kaisatsuko (Japanese: 回擦胡, literally "wheel-bowed fiddle") is a mechanical experimental musical instrument invented by Yuichi Onoue of Tokyo, Japan.Kaisatsuko on Oddmusic.com
The instrument consists of two strings on a fretless neck.  A crank is affixed to a small nylon wheel mounted on the body.  The player turns the crank, causing the wheel to spin and "bow" the strings.  This concept is similar to that employed by the hurdy-gurdy.  Unlike most hurdy-gurdies, Onoue's instrument has no keybox, but is fingered along the neck.  This detail is similar to the dulcigurdy, a hurdy-gurdy variant recorded by Michael Praetorius.
Besides the Kaisatsuko Onoue also developed an 24-TET quarter tone tuning on his guitar as well as a deeply scaloped electric guitar for microtonal playing techniques.Yuichi Onoue on hypercustom.com

[[Cohors V Delmatarum c.R.]]
CATEGORIES: Auxiliary infantry units of ancient Rome

Cohors quinta Delmatarum civium Romanorum ("5th Cohort of Dalmatae Roman citizens") was a Roman auxiliary infantry regiment. It is named after the Dalmatae (or Delmatae), an Illyrian-speaking tribe that inhabited the Adriatic coastal mountain range of the eponymous Dalmatia. The ancient geographer Strabo describes these mountains as extremely rugged, and the Dalmatae as backward and warlike. He claims that they did not use money long after their neighbours adopted it and that they "made war on the Romans for a long time". He also criticises the Dalmatae, a nation of pastoralists, for turning fertile plains into sheep pasture.Strabo Geographia VII.5 Indeed, the name of the tribe itself is believed to mean "shepherds", derived from the Illyrian word delme ("sheep").Spaul (2000) 304 The final time this people fought against Rome was in the Illyrian revolt of AD 6-9. The revolt was started by Dalmatae auxiliary forces and soon spread all over Dalmatia and Pannonia. The resulting war was described by the Roman writer Suetonius as the most difficult faced by Rome since the Punic Wars two centuries earlier. But after the war, the Dalmatae became a loyal and important source of recruits for the Roman army.
According to Holder, a total of 12 cohortes Delmatarum appear to have been raised after the suppression of the Illyrian revolt in two series, of 7 and 5 respectively. All these units were in existence by the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54)Holder (1980) 112 Of these, 9 appear to have survived into the 2nd century.Spaul (2000) 302-14
The regiment was probably raised by founder-emperor Augustus (r. 30 BC - AD 14) after 9 AD. It was certainly in existence by the time of Claudius (r. 41-54).  Spaul (2000) 308 It is unclear why two cohortes Delmatarum were given the same number V: this regiment and another V Delmatarum in Germania Superior). Spaul suggests the regiment in Mauretania may be the cohors I Liburnorum,  renamed. The regiment first appears in the datable epigraphic record in AD 88 in Mauretania Tingitana. It was still there in 158, the time of its last datable inscription.
Apart from diplomas, there is no epigraphic evidence for this unit. The regiment's title c.R. first appears in a diploma of 122. The honorific title civium Romanorum (c.R. for short) was normally awarded by the emperor for valour to an auxiliary regiment as a whole. The award would include the grant of Roman citizenship to all the regiment's men, but not to subsequent recruits to the regiment. The regiment, however, would retain the prestigious title in perpetuity.Goldsworthy (2005) 97 (N.B. Until 212, only a minority of the empire's inhabitants (inc. all Italians) held full Roman citizenship. The rest were denoted peregrini, a second-class status. Since the legions admitted only citizens, peregrini could only enlist in the auxilia. Citizenship carried a number of tax and other privileges and was highly sought-after. It could be earned by serving in the auxilia for the minimum 25-year term.

[[Herringbone gear]]
CATEGORIES: Gears

A herringbone gear, a specific type of double helical gear, is a special type of gear which is a side to side (not face to face) combination of two helical gears of opposite hands.Herringbone gears From the top the helical grooves of this gear looks like letter V. Unlike helical gears they do not produce an additional axial load. 
Like helical gears, they have the advantage of transferring power smoothly because more than two teeth will be in mesh at any moment in time. Their advantage over the helical gears is that the side-thrust of one half is balanced by that of the other half. This means that herringbone gears can be used in torque gearboxes without requiring a substantial thrust bearing. Because of this herringbone gears were an important step in the introduction of the steam turbine to marine propulsion.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
Precision herringbone gears are more difficult to manufacture than equivalent spur or helical gears and consequently are more expensive. 
They are used in heavy machinery.
Where the oppositely angled teeth meet in the middle of a herringbone gear, the alignment may be such that tooth tip meets tooth tip, or the alignment may be staggered, so that tooth tip meets tooth trough. The latter alignment is the unique defining characteristic of a Wuest type herringbone gear, named after its inventor.

Alfred Schreiber (11 November 1923 – 26 November 1944), nicknamed "Bubi", was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace. He is noted for claiming the first aerial victory by a jet fighter in aviation history. He was born on 11 November 1923 in Keplachowitz.
On 26 July 1944, Leutnant Schreiber, a former Zerstörergeschwader 26 pilot, intercepted and attacked a Mosquito PR XVI, a photo-reconnaissance aircraft from No. 540 Squadron RAF, while flying Messerschmitt Me 262 A-1a W.Nr. 130 017. It is often referred to as the first aerial victory by a jet fighter in aviation history.Radinger & Schick 1993, p. 51. Although damaged, the Mosquito, did in fact, manage to return to an Allied held airfield in Italy and the aircraft was lost in the crash landing.Morgan & Weal 1998, p. 16–17. Schreiber would be credited with a further four aerial victories before being killed on 26 November 1944, making him one of the first jet aces in history.For a list of Luftwaffe jet aces, see List of German World War II jet aces. Schreiber was killed in a crash landing at Lechfeld flying the same Me 262 A-1a WNr. 130 017. His wheels caught the lip of a slit trench, causing his Me 262 to cartwheel.Morgan & Weal 1998, p. 92.

UKRA is also the specialist body to the BMFA (British Model Flying Association) with responsibilities for High Power Rocketry, and is the United Kingdom body recognized by the Civil Aviation Authority.Civil Aviation Authority CAP 658 Model Aircraft: A Guide to Safe Flying,
Formed in 1996 at a meeting of UK rocketry societies and clubs established at that time, as well as amateur rocketeers, the formation meeting took place at the International Rocket Week http://irw.rocketry.org.uk, at Largs in Scotland.  UKRA works through the current UKRA affiliated rocketry clubs and societies.http://www.ears.org.uk, These rocketry clubs and societies organise rocket launches which take place on a monthly basis at their launch sites. UKRA liaises with government bodies on behalf of UK rocketeers and, through its certification programme and network of Range Safety Officers, ensures safe launches. UKRA has safety rules to ensure that rocket launching takes place in clear skies, and care is taken to
ensure that the planned trajectory avoids any passing aircraft. In addition, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM's) are issued to pilots of aircraft notifying them of the rocket launching site and times of rocketry activity.General aviation safety information leaflet (GASIL), 2 of 2006, Civil Aviation Authority,
UKRA also has a reciprocal certification arrangement with U.S. equivalent, the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA).
UKRA also provides, through the BMFA, 3rd party liability insurance of up to £25 million which is included in Full UKRA membership and allows rocket motors of up to M-class (10,240 Newton seconds total impulse) to be used with the correct certification."The Space transportation market: evolution or revolution", edited by M. Rycroft, International Space University
UKRA's Large Rocket Scheme caters for rockets exceeding 10,240 Newton seconds total impulse.
UKRA also maintains a comprehensive set of tables of UK amateur and experimental rocketry records, and a procedure to enable records to be verified.
With the Model Achievement Programme, UKRA extended their activities into schools and youth groups, in an effort to popularise the hobby, and provide encouragement and inspiration to future generations of rocketeers. It was instrumental in starting UKAYRoC (United Kingdom Aerospace Youth Rocketry Challenge). This is a challenge open to 11-18 year olds where teams of 3-5 students with an adult supervisor design, build and launch a model rocket with a specific mission criteria. Details of the competition can be found on the UKAYRoC website. 
In 2009, the winning school was Royal Liberty School, Romford. In May, they flew out to Washington DC to fly off against the winners of the Team America Rocketry Challenge competition run by The National Association of Rocketry NAR and Aerospace Industries Association.''UK Students Win International Rocket Contest Fly-Off AIA News, May 16, 2009 The British team was successful for the second year running.

[[Cohors V Delmatarum]]
CATEGORIES: Auxiliary infantry units of ancient Rome

Cohors quinta Delmatarum ("5th Cohort of Dalmatae") was a Roman auxiliary infantry unit. It is named after the Dalmatae, an Illyrian-speaking tribe that inhabited the Adriatic coastal mountain range of the eponymous Dalmatia. The ancient geographer Strabo describes these mountains as extremely rugged, and the Dalmatae as backward and warlike. He claims that they did not use money long after their neighbours adopted it and that they "made war on the Romans for a long time". He also criticises the Dalmatae, a nation of pastoralists, for turning fertile plains into sheep pasture.Strabo Geographia VII.5 Indeed, the name of the tribe itself is believed to mean "shepherds", derived from the Illyrian word delme ("sheep").Spaul (2000) 304 The final time this people fought against Rome was in the Illyrian revolt of 6-9 AD. The revolt was started by Dalmatae auxiliary forces and soon spread all over Dalmatia and Pannonia. The resulting war was described by the Roman writer Suetonius as the most difficult faced by Rome since the Punic Wars two centuries earlier. But after the war, the Dalmatae became a loyal and important source of recruits for the Roman army.
According to Holder, a total of 12 cohortes Delmatarum appear to have been raised after the suppression of the Illyrian revolt in two series, of 7 and 5 respectively. All these units were in existence by the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54)Holder (1980) 112 Of these, 9 appear to have survived into the 2nd century.Spaul (2000) 302-14
The regiment was probably raised by founder-emperor Augustus (r. 30BC-14AD) after 9 AD. It was certainly in existence by the time of Claudius (r. 41-54).   It is unclear why two cohortes Delmatarum were given the same number V: this regiment and cohors V Delmatarum c.R. in Mauretania Tingitana). Spaul suggests the regiment in Mauretania may be the cohors I Liburnorum renamed.Spaul (2000) 309 The regiment first appears in the datable epigraphic record in 74 AD in Germania (prob. Superior). It was still in Germania Superior in 185, the time of its last datable inscription.Holder (2003) 137 The regiment's tile stamp has been found at the Roman fort of Böckingen and epitaphs at Arnsburg, Moguntiacum and Wiesbaden.
The names of 1 praefectus (regimental commander) and 2 centuriones (infantry officers) are preserved, without origins. The names of 3 caligati (common soldiers) are also preserved, two of whom were Illyrians.

Landon "Sonny" Cox is a Jazz alto saxophonist, born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1938. His mother Helen Harris was a singer and performed with Erskine Hawkins. He first played with The Rocks a Cincinnati-based group that backed Jackie Wilson, Jerry Butler, Solomon Burke, Lavern Baker and other soul artists. In 1955, Cox met organist Ken Prince and they began to work together around Chicago. In 1964, they formed the Three Souls with drummer Robert Shy. The group made three albums for the Argo-Cadet label.
In 1974, Cox became the baseball coach for Paul Robeson High School (Chicago, Illinois).  In 1981, he became the basketball coach at King College Prep High School, where he coached three state basketball championship teams.[tpl]Citation| title = Sonny Cox Must Be Doing Something Right | newspaper = The Reader| pages = | date = 14 September 1989| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/sonny-cox-must-be-doing-something-right/Content?oid=874420| accessdate =22 August 2011[/tpl]  In 2006, Cox was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament.
According to jazz critic Joe Segal, Cox was influenced by Earl Bostic and Charlie Parker:
"Sonny's general sound is an amalgamation of the jazz feeling (derived from a Charlie Parker spark) and a warm fuzzy throaty sound and approach influenced by the daddy of the rock altoists Earl Bostic" (liner notes of Argo 4036). He also sounds sometimes like Hank Crawford.

The Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille (Lille Palace of Fine Arts) is one of the largest museums in France, and the largest French museum outside of Paris.
It was one of the first museums built in France, established under the instructions of Napoleon I at the beginning of the 19th century as part of the popularisation of art : Jean-Antoine Chaptal's decree of 1801 selected fifteen French cities (among which Lille) to receive the works seized from churches and from the territories occupied by the armies of Revolutionary France. The painters Louis Joseph Watteau and François Watteau, known as the "Watteau of Lille", were heavily involved in the museum's beginnings - Louis Joseph Watteau made in 1795 the first inventory of the paintings confiscated during the Revolution, whilst his son François was deputy curator of the museum from 1808 to 1823.
The museum opened in 1809 and was initially housed in a church confiscated from the Récollets before being transferred to the city's town hall. In 1866, the "musée Wicar", formed from the collection of Jean-Baptiste Wicar, was merged into the Palais des Beaux-Arts. Construction of the Palais's current Belle Époque-style building began in 1885 under the direction of Géry Legrand, mayor of Lille, and it was completed in 1892. The architects chosen to design the new building were Edouard Bérard (1843–1912) and Fernand Etienne-Charles Delmas (1852–1933) from Paris. The building is located on the place de la République, in the center of the city, facing the préfecture of Lille. It was renovated during the 1990s and reopened in 1997.
At the start of the 1990s, the building's poor state and the moving of Vauban's relief models of fortified towns to Lille forced the town to renovate the building. Work began in 1991, under the architects Jean-Marc Ibos and Myrto Vitart, and was completed in 1997. This allowed the creation of a new 700 m² basement room for temporary exhibitions, as well as departments for the relief models and for 19th-century sculpture. Overall the museum covers 22000 m², the second largest collection in France after the Louvre. Its sculptures, paintings, drawings, ceramics and so on include works by Raphael, Donatello, Van Dyck, Tissot, Jordaens, Rembrandt, Goya, El Greco, David, Corot, Courbet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens, Rodin, Claudel and Jean-Baptiste Chardin.

[[Friendship]]

CATEGORIES: Friendship, Gender studies, Group processes

Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between two or more people.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl] Friendship is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. A World Happiness Database study found that people with close friendships are happier.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23097143 | work=BBC News | title=Can we make ourselves happier? | date=1 July 2013[/tpl]
Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of friendship. Such characteristics include affection, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism, mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.
While there is no practical limit on what types of people can form a friendship, friends tend to share common backgrounds, occupations, or interests, and have similar demographics.

[[History of the Constitution of the Roman Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Government of the Kingdom of Rome, Constitutions of Ancient Rome

The History of the Constitution of the Roman Kingdom is a study of the ancient Roman Kingdom that traces the progression of Roman political development from the founding of the city of Rome in 753 BC to the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC. The constitution of the Roman Kingdom vested the sovereign power in the King of Rome. The king did have two rudimentary checks on his authority, which took the form of a board of elders (the "Roman Senate") and a popular assembly (the "Curiate Assembly"). The arrangement was similar to the constitutional arrangements found in contemporary Greek city-states (such as Athens or Sparta). These Greek constitutional principles probably came to Rome through the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. In the centuries before the legendary founding of the city of Rome, Greek settlers had colonized much of the Mediterranean world. These settlers carried Greek ideals with them, and often kept in contact with the Greek mainland. Thus, the superstructure of the Roman constitution was ultimately of Greek origin.

The Philippines Central Conference is considered a member Church of the World Methodist Council, and independent of The United Methodist Church in the United States. It is also a member of the Christian Conference of Asia and the National Council of Churches in the Philippines as "The United Methodist Church in the Philippines", representing the denomination as its Philippine counterpart.
The Philippines Central Conference is further subdivided into twenty-two (22) regions, called Annual Conference, under the authorities of three Episcopal Areas. These Annual Conferences are subdivided into "Districts," which provide further administrative functions for the operation of local churches in cooperation with each other under the supervision of the District Superintendent. This structure is vital to Methodism, and is referred to as "connexionalism".
The Philippines Central Conference has a professing membership of about 200,540, but it serves a much larger community of close to 1 million. From six annual conferences in 1968, The United Methodist Church in the Philippines has grown to 19 annual conferences located in three episcopal areas.Mission + message = Filipino United Methodists And now, with 24 Annual conferences.

[[Tank transporter]]
CATEGORIES: Tank transporters, Military trucks

A tank transporter is a specialized road vehicle for the transport of tanks, to and from the battlefield or during peacetime. They are necessary to limit the mileage of the tracked vehicles (as the tracks have a limited lifetime) and also to reduce wear on road surfaces which can easily be damaged by such heavy vehicles. Tank transporters also use less fuel than tracked vehicles and may have a higher road speed if provided with a good road network.
They may also be used for wheeled armoured cars, or for unarmoured tracked vehicles, though the advantages of using transporters are usually less substantial in these cases.

[[Ridolfo II da Varano di Camerino]]

CATEGORIES: Condottieri, 1344 births, 1384 deaths

Ridolfo (sometimes Rodolfo) II da Varano, signore di Camerino (flourishing 1344 — 1384), was a condottiero operating in Italy from the 1360s. His forebears had long heldIn 1239 one Ridolfo di Gentile da Varano was named as holding the fortified height. the rocca of Varano on the borderland of the Papal States, controlling a major strategic pass between Umbria and the Marche, a link between Rome and the Adriatic coast.Sistema Museale della provincia di Macerata He inherited from Gentile di Berardo da Varano in 1355, and undertook the improvement of the fortifications that protected the commune and its rocca.
The son of Berardo da Varano and nephew of Gentile di Berardo da Varano, whom he succeeded in 1355,Varano (famiglia) Ridolfo had proved his mettle in a dramatic capture of Smyrna in 1344, in guise of a "crusade" for the Knights of Rhodes under Jean de Biandra, Prior of Lombardy.P.L. Falaschi, "Splendori di una Signoria inedita", in AA.VV. I volti di una dinastia, Milano 2001 In the year of his inheritance he gained a signal victory over Galeotto de' Malatesta near Paderno di Ancona in 1355, captured Recanati and at Castelfidardo made Galeotto prisoner; on 2 June 1355, a treaty was concluded, approved by Pope Innocent VI on 20 June.M. Ott, "Alvarez Carillo Gil de Albornoz, The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. Retrieved December 23, 2009. The treaty was cemented by his marriage with Galeotto's daughter.  In 1360 he fought for Pope Clement VI.  Subsequently he was created Papal gonfaloniere and reconquered Rimini, Fano, Pesaro, Fossombrone, Ascoli Piceno and Forlì. Later he was hired by the Angevines of Naples, for whom he was governor of Abruzzo.
In 1362 he fought for the Florentines against Pisa, notably in the capture of Peccioli, where he succeeded Bonifazio Lupo, to whom Matteo, the continuator of  Giovanni Villani's chronicle, compared him, as "nobler in birth, but much inferior in swiftness and mind".più illustre di nascita, ma inferiore assai per prontezza e per mente. "Assedio di Peccioli" a lack of initiative: "He remained sleeping mornings until the third hour, in a bed supplied with low company and leading a quiet, courtly life>"Stava dormendo la mattina fino alla terza, con letto fornito di disonesta compagnia e menando vita di corte quieta
In 1370 he victoriously warred for Florence against Bernabò Visconti. The commune of Camerino was one of many in the Papal States that rose in rebellion against papal authority during the war headed by Florence against the French-allied papacy of Gregory XI, in which Ser John Hawkwood ("Giovanni Acuto") distinguished himself. In 1375 Ridolfo held Bologna, until recently occupied by papal troops under a legate, for the appointed emergency Florentine magistracy, the Otto di Guardia ("Eight of War").Bella Duffy, The Tuscan Republics (Florence, Siena, Pisa, and Lucca) with Genoa 1892:174ff, mentioned p. 177. Then, however, in a reverse typical of the times, in 1377 he was made commander-in-chief by Gregory XI, and was sent to fight against Florence. As an ally of the cardinal general of papal forces, Gil de Albornoz, in operations once more  against the Malatesta of Rimini, turning over to him the supreme command of the papal army.  For this the Florentines had him depicted on the facade of a public building, in a pittura infamante, "traitor to the Holy Mother Church, to the popolo and commune of Florence and to all its allies," as hanging by his left foot, upside down on a gallows, with a siren on his left and a basilisk on his right while wearing a bishop's mitre (circa October 13, 1377),Trevor Dean, The Towns of Italy in the Later Middle Ages (Manchester University Press) 2000:45.
His rise as papal commander was however halted when, due to strife with Albornoz, the latter had him imprisoned. After being freed, Rodolfo moved again to support the Republic of Florence, for which he took part in the conquest of Pisa in 1362. The following year he warred for Perugia. In the same period, with the consent of Pope Urban V, he had his uncle killed and therefore he became lord of Camerino. He became also lord of Macerata.  Rodolfo suffered however two defeats at Montemilone and Fabriano.
He died at Tolentino in 1384.

[[Cohors VII Delmatarum equitata]]
CATEGORIES: Auxiliary equitata units of ancient Rome

Cohors septima Delmatarum equitata ("7th part-mounted Cohort of Dalmatae") was a Roman auxiliary mixed infantry and cavalry regiment. It is named after the Dalmatae, an Illyrian-speaking tribe that inhabited the Adriatic coastal mountain range of the eponymous Dalmatia. The ancient geographer Strabo describes these mountains as extremely rugged, and the Dalmatae as backward and warlike. He claims that they did not use money long after their neighbours adopted it and that they "made war on the Romans for a long time". He also criticises the Dalmatae, a nation of pastoralists, for turning fertile plains into sheep pasture.Strabo Geographia VII.5 Indeed, the name of the tribe itself is believed to mean "shepherds", derived from the Illyrian word delme ("sheep").Spaul (2000) 304 The final time this people fought against Rome was in the Illyrian revolt of 6-9 AD. The revolt was started by Dalmatae auxiliary forces and soon spread all over Dalmatia and Pannonia. The resulting war was described by the Roman writer Suetonius as the most difficult faced by Rome since the Punic Wars two centuries earlier. But after the war, the Dalmatae became a loyal and important source of recruits for the Roman army.
According to Holder, a total of 12 cohortes Delmatarum appear to have been raised after the suppression of the Illyrian revolt in two series, of 7 and 5 respectively. All these units were in existence by the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54)Holder (1980) 112 Of these, 9 appear to have survived into the 2nd century.Spaul (2000) 302-14
The regiment was probably raised by founder-emperor Augustus (r. 30BC-14AD) after 9 AD. It was certainly in existence by the time of Claudius (r. 41-54).  There is no diploma evidence for this regiment and the remaining inscriptions cannot be accurately dated. However, it is certain that it was serving in Mauretania Caesariensis in the 1st century. It is unlikely to have continued there into the 2nd century, as it is missing in the diploma list for 107. All its surviving inscriptions have been found on one site, Cherchel (Algeria), presumably its regular base, perhaps shared with its sister regiment VI Delmatarum eq.Spaul (2000) 311 Given the complete absence of later evidence, it is likely that the regiment was disbanded or destroyed in action by the end of the 1st century.
The names of one decurio (cavalry officer) and 2 caligati (common soldiers) are attested, the latter Illyrians.

[tpl]good article[/tpl][tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry and currently under the ownership of CBS and Paramount.For a more detailed history of the ownership of the franchise, see the corporate ownership section. Star Trek: The Original Series and its live action TV spin-off shows, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise as well as the Star Trek film series make up the main canon, while Star Trek: The Animated Series as well as the expansive library of Star Trek novels and comics are part of the franchise, but are generally considered non-canon.There has been debate as to whether The Animated Series should be part of the Star Trek canon.  See The Animated Series section for more details.
The first series, now referred to as "The Original Series", debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC. It followed the interstellar adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise, an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar "United Federation of Planets". In creating the first "Star Trek", Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train, along with the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver's Travels. These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. Four spin-off television series were eventually produced: Star Trek: The Next Generation, followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a relaunch with a prequel to the original series set in an alternate timeline titled simply Star Trek. This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original Enterprise. A sequel to this film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered on May 16, 2013.
Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades.[tpl]cite news | last =Italie| first =Hillel| title =Potter Reaches Cult Phenomenon Status| work =Seattle Times| agency =Associated Press| date =July 2, 2007| url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html| accessdate =October 19, 2011 [/tpl] In this article, the status of Star Trek as a cult phenomenon is repeatedly taken as read. Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers. The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas which opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of Star Trek. Its fans, despite the end of Star Trek episodes on TV, have produced several fan productions to fill that void.
Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction. It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions such as the cell phone. Moreover, the show is noted for its progressive civil rights stances. The original series included one of television's first multiracial casts, and the first televised inter-racial kiss. Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the cartoon series South Park.

[tpl]nihongo|Sadao Hasegawa|長谷川 サダオ|Hasegawa Sadao|1950 - November 20, 1999[/tpl] was a prominent Japanese graphic artist specializing in male erotica. His work is notable for superb technical skills, elaborate  fantastic settings (occasionally reminiscent of William Blake), and for incorporating Japanese, Indian, South-East Asian and African mythology. While focusing on depictions of muscular male physique, Hasegawa often turns to extreme sexual situations, bondage and SM themes, which, in the context of his stylized fantasy world, attain a nearly sacral intensity.
Aside from a few, intermittent appearances in gay magazines, Hasegawa Sadao's monograph “Paradise Vision” (1996 Kochi Studio) has been the only introduction of this talented artist in Japan. Gaining much attention overseas, with publications in the UK and numerous contributions to magazines in the US and Europe, Hasegawa's works have not been done justice in his home country. With great influences from Edo-Period Shungas (erotic art), his obsession and display of beauty in the male body and sex combined with Asian motifs result in a truly concentrated representation of eroticism. 
Hasegawa was born in the Tokai area of Japan in the 1950s. Travels to India during his 20's and starts to take up drawing on his own. In 1973 he debuted his works on his first exhibition "Sadao Hasegawa's Alchemism-Meditation for 1973" in Tokyo, Japan, presents oil painting, collages, drawings and sculptures. In 1990 he published "Sadao Hasegawa" from G.M.P Co. England. Despite his overseas popularity, he however, has refused numerous offers to exhibit overseas, not wanting to distribute his works abroad. In 1990s he started to wandering around Indonesia (esp. Bali) and Thailand, the Balinese and Siamese imagery reflected on his works from this period, and some of Indonesian and Thai words are written on his works. One of his most celebrated work, the "Paradise Vision" was published by Kochi Studio in 1996. He ended his life by committing suicide on November 20, 1999 in Bangkok, Thailand. In 2000 Naruyama Gallery exhibited his last works "Linga", due to the request of the Sadao's family, who found a will requesting his posthumous exhibition written by Sadao before his death.

[[Green Methanol Synthesis]]

CATEGORIES: Energy development

Green-Methanol Synthesis or Green-Methanol is entirely developed from renewable sources of energy.  Methanol made from this process would predominately synthesize from the following reaction:  
How this differs from traditional methanol synthesis processes is what makes this process green.  Hydrogen gas must be collected from the dissociation of water.  The electrolysis of water must in turn be powered by a renewable source of electricity (wind, biomass, solar).  The carbon-dioxide in turn can be culled from industries which already output copious amounts of the gas; thereby, preventing the gas from entering the atmosphere.

Also known as a Gala Day or Field Day. An annual community celebration, common in rural communities in North West England, during which clubs, churches and other organizations process and gather for various activities such as competitions for fancy dress, arts and crafts, cooking and produce.
Many of these events originated in processions of the churches and some will have, or have had, a strong agricultural background.
Most villages will 'claim' the same weekend each year to avoid conflicting with neighbouring villages.
The events often have at their centre a Rose or Field Day Queen. These are young girls, selected for the year, whose duties include the official opening of the event and a central role in any procession. In some villages such as Ribchester the Field Day Queen is responsible for the official opening of other village events.

The song was first released in 1998 on the legendary Belgian trance label Bonzai Records. After receiving positive reviews, the song was signed in France, Spain and Germany. One year later, other European countries followed (UK, Italy, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands). Due to the several individual releases, the song has three different titles: Universal Nation, Universal Nation ’99 and Universal Nation (The Real Anthem).[tpl]cite web|title=PUSH - UNIVERSAL NATION (THE REAL ANTHEM) (NUMMER)|url=http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Push&titel=Universal+Nation+(The+Real+Anthem)&cat=s|publisher=Ultratop|accessdate=2008-10-10[/tpl]
Mike Dierickx is generally praised for his high quality productions. Universal Nation is often quoted as an "all time favorite trance record". In 1999 Universal Nation won "Best club single Move-X Dance Awards".
Universal Nation was followed by "Cosmonautica",  "Legacy", "Please Save Me" (feat. Sunscreem) and "Strange World". All of them were extremely well received in the European clubscene.

[[Sheep]]

CATEGORIES: Sheep's-milk cheeses, Sheep, Megafauna, Herbivorous animals, Animals described in 1758, Livestock

Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe ([tpl]IPAc-en|juː[/tpl]), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a  lamb.  
Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones.  Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.
Sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.
Sheepraising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.
Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.

While he was at the club they won two premierships but Lambert missed out on playing in both. A half back flanker, Lambert did however win their Best and fairest award once, sharing it with Bill Walker in 1909.

Heinz Arnold (12 February 1919 in Flöha in Saxony – 17 April 1945) was a former German Luftwaffe fighter ace. He is credited with 49 aerial victories including seven victories claimed flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.For a list of Luftwaffe Jet aces see List of German World War II jet aces
Arnold joined the Luftwaffe in September 1939, training for a technical role with the Kampffliegerschule at Tutow. Arnold began flying training in January 1940 with Flieger Ausbildungs Rgt. 12., before advanced training with Jagdfliegerschule 5 in late 1940.
Arnold was then posted to Jagdgeschwader 5 on the Arctic Front. He claimed some 42 victories during 1942–44, before transferring into 11 staffel, JG 7 to fly Me 262 jets. Oberfeldwebel Arnold claimed another 7 victories, (including five four-engine bombers) in March 1945.
Arnold's Me 262 A-1a (Werknummer 500491—factory number) "Yellow 7" was unserviceable at Alt Lönnewitz when, on 17 April 1945, Arnold took a replacement Me 262A-1a into an action from which he failed to return.

The Treaty of Butre between the Netherlands and Ahanta was signed at Butre (historical spelling: Boutry), Dutch Gold Coast on 27 August 1656. The treaty regulated the jurisdiction of the Netherlands and the Dutch West India Company over the town of Butre and the surrounding country of Upper Ahanta, creating a Dutch protectorate over the area. The treaty lasted until the Dutch departure from the Gold Coast in April 1872.

Lewis was born in Roath, Cardiff, Wales, the son of Henry Lewis, a mining engineer, and his wife Catherine Hannah (née Davies). He was educated at home by his mother, apart from a year at Clifton College, which he left due to ill-health, and the final two years by a tutor. Already planning to become a doctor, at the age of sixteen he began a Bachelor of Science (BSc) course at University College, Cardiff, graduating three years later with first class honours. In 1902 he entered University College Hospital in London to train as a doctor, graduating MBBS with the gold medal in 1905. The same year he was awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from the University of Wales for his research work.
He remained at UCH for the rest of his life, beginning as a house physician. From 1907 he also worked at the Royal Naval Hospital and the City of London Hospital and the same year he took his Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. In 1911 he was appointed  lecturer in cardiac pathology at UCH and in 1913 was promoted to assistant physician in clinical work. He was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) in 1913.
While still a house physician, Lewis began physiological research, carrying out fundamental research on the heart, the pulse and blood pressure. From 1906, he corresponded with the Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven concerning the latter's invention of the string galvanometer and electrocardiography, and Lewis pioneered its use in clinical settings. Accordingly, Lewis is considered the "father of clinical cardiac electrophysiology". The first use of electrocardiography in clinical medicine was in 1908. In that year, Thomas Lewis and Arthur MacNalty (later the Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom) employed electrocardiography to diagnose heart block.”A note on the simultaneous occurrence of sinus and ventricular rhythm in man”, Lewis T, Macnalty AS, J Physiol. 1908 Dec 15;37(5-6):445-58 In 1909, with James MacKenzie, Lewis founded the journal Heart: A Journal for the Study of the Circulation, which he renamed Clinical Science in 1933. In 1913, he published the book  Clinical Electrocardiography, the first treaty on electrocardiography. Lewis was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1918. He was promoted to full physician at UCH in 1919. 
During the First World War, Lewis worked at the Military Heart Hospital in Hampstead and was appointed to the first full-time clinical research post in Britain, at the Medical Research Committee (later Medical Research Council). He directed a study of the condition known as "soldier's heart" and, having established it was not a cardiological problem, renamed it the "effort syndrome". In 1918 he wrote the monograph The Soldier's Heart and the Effort Syndrome. He devised remedial exercises that allowed many soldiers suffering from the condition to return to duty, and for this he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1920[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=31760 |date=27 January 1920|startpage=1237|supp=yes[/tpl] and was knighted the following year.
After the war, he established the clinical research department at UCH and continued his work on cardiac arrhythmia. In 1925 he switched his focus from cardiography to vascular reactions of the skin. In 1917 he had shown that capillaries had independent contractions and he now investigated the response of the skin to injury, leading to the 1927 monograph The Blood Vessels of the Human Skin and their Responses. He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1927 "for his researches on the vascular system, following upon his earlier work on the mammalian heart-beat." Next, he switched his focus to peripheral vascular disease, especially Raynaud's disease, and finally to the mechanism of pain, summarising his findings in Pain in 1942. His 1932 book Diseases of the Heart became a standard medical text.
In 1930, he founded the Medical Research Society. He was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1941 "for his clinical and experimental investigations upon the mammalian heart." He was only the second clinician to receive it, after Lord Lister in 1902. He served as vice-president of the Royal Society from 1943 to 1945.
Lewis suffered a myocardial infarction at the age of 45 and gave up his 70-cigarette-a-day habit, being one of the first to realise that smoking damaged the blood vessels. He died from coronary heart disease at his home at Loudwater, Hertfordshire on 17 March 1945. He had married Alice Lorna Treharne James in 1916; they had three children.

[[Erprobungskommando]]
CATEGORIES: Military units and formations of the Luftwaffe

An Erprobungskommando (EKdo) ("Testing-command") was a variety of Luftwaffe special-purpose unit tasked with the testing of new aircraft and weaponry under operational conditions. Similarly-named Erprobungs-prefixed squadron (staffel) and group (gruppe) sized units also existed at various times in the Luftwaffe during 1939-1944 to service-test new designs, usually numbered with the RLM aircraft designation system airframe number matching the aircraft they were meant to test, with the three digit number following the "8-xxx" RLM airframe number designating the unit, as with Erprobungsstaffel 177 (contracted to E-Staffel 177), charged with testing the A-0 production prototypes of the Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.[tpl]cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 - 277 - 274 |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |pages=55-62 [/tpl] The similarly-prefixed Erprobungsgruppe 210 was meant to have service-tested the Messerschmitt Me 210 twin-engined "destroyer" and light bomber, but that design's early aerodynamic problems caused the unit's transformation and expansion into SKG 210, a dedicated "fast bomber" unit using Bf 110s instead.

[[Kirkcowan]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Dumfries and Galloway

Kirkcowan is an area about 15 miles in length, and from nearly two to nearly seven miles in breadth, comprising 30,580 acres, of which 7000 are arable, 300 woodland and plantations, and the remainder meadow, pasture in Machars, Wigtownshire, in the District Council Region of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, with the village of Kirkowan, bounded on the east by the river Bladnoch, on the west by the river Tarf, and is 6 miles W. by S.W. from Newton Stewart.
Kirkcowan with its wide moorlands is one of the larger Wigtownshire areas, and a map of the area/parish can be seen at the National Library of Scotland, on the John Ainslie map AD1782.http://maps.nls.uk/counties/view/?id=685
The principal industry has always been agriculture, although in the 19th century two woollen mills were erected on the River Tarf nearby.
The A75 road which goes through Kirkcowan is effectively the London - Belfast road. The road forms part of the international E-road, European route E18.
There is a Community Council at Kirkcowan.http://www.kirkcowan.com/community-council/
Kirkcowan is on the medieval pilgrim route to Whithorn Priory, seat of Christianity in Scotland.

[[Government of Hamburg]]
CATEGORIES: Government of Hamburg

The government of Hamburg is divided into executive, legislative and judicial branches. Due to the characteristic that Hamburg is a city-state and a municipality in Germany, the governance deals with several details of both state politics and community politics. It takes place in two ranks – a city-wide and state administration (Senate of Hamburg), and a local rank for the boroughs. The head of the city-state's government is the First Mayor and President of the Senate. A ministry is called Behörde (office) and a state minister is a Senator in Hamburg. The legislature is the state parliament, called Hamburgische Bürgerschaft, and the judicial branch is composed of the state supreme court and other courts. The seat of the government is Hamburg Rathaus.
Prior to 1871, Hamburg was a fully sovereign country, and its government a sovereign government. Upon joining the German Empire, the city-state retained partial sovereignty as a federal state. It was one of three republics within the German Empire until 1919, which meant that its First Mayor enjoyed the same rank in the Empire as the federal princes. Prior to the constitutional reforms in 1919, the hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten, had a legally privileged position and were the only ones eligible for being elected to the senate.
The local rank is organised in the 7 boroughs of Hamburg.

More intriguing perhaps, visitors can also enter the crypt at the rear of the church which contains a number of full skeletons lying in state, in the darkness of the church's crypt.

Farm Fresh To You is a subscription Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) provider of organic produce based in Capay Valley, California. The farm was started in 1976 by two back-to-the-landers, Martin Barnes and Kathleen Barsotti who were raised in California suburbs.
Inspired by University of California, Davis professor Isao Fujimoto, the farm began as a garden on rented land. The couple helped to start the Davis Certified Farmers' Marketdavisfarmersmarket.org and the Davis Food Coop Storefrontdaviscoop.com before moving with their twin boys to [tpl]convert|22|acre|m2[/tpl] in Capay Valley in 1979. The farm was one of the earliest in Yolo County to have organic certification from the California Certified Organic Farmers.ibiblio.org
Local sales were supplemented by sales to San Francisco Bay area farmers' markets and to wholesalers such as Veritable Vegetableveritablevegetable.com and Greenleaf Producegreenleafsf.com  Two more sons were born, but in 1990 the couple suffered a marital breakup leaving Kathleen to manage the business. She founded the Farm Fresh to You subscription CSA in 1992, and it soon became an essential element in the farm's income.
Kathleen died from breast cancer in 2000 leaving her sons to inherit the farm. They expanded the farm, buying and renting land from neighbors, and establishing a retail store, Capay Organic, at the San Francisco Ferry Building.
By 2008, Farm Fresh to You had grown to over 4000 families in Northern California making it one of the largest CSA farms. The boys have kept alive the ideals of their pioneering parents by providing fresh, organically grown food, husbanding the land, and respecting the farm's employees.

The National Amateur Rowing Association (NARA) was founded in 1890 to cater for the large number of working class men who were prevented from joining the Amateur Rowing Association (ARA) by virtue of their manual occupations. (According to the interpretation of the narrow definition of Amateur status then enforced by the ARA rules, these men were to be considered professionals).
This definition of "amateur" was finally resolved in the 1920s and in 1930 NARA was reconstituted, its objectives being "to foster and encourage amateur rowing and to watch over and generally protect its interests." (Articles of Association 1930). [tpl]ref|Nara[/tpl]
In 1939 NARA was incorporated as a non-profit making company. 
The new body gained significant support though practically, the only difference between the two organisations was their outlook on the bar on manual labour; in all other respects the NARA was as strict about amateurism as the ARA.  Its first president was the Duke of Fife and its last Lord Iveagh.
The organisation was however very different from that of the ARA, as the NARA was composed of ten self-governing regional associations:
All of these were actively engaged in organising regattas for their member clubs and around 90 regattas a year followed NARA rules.

The Abbey of Saint-Loup of Troyes  (Abbaye Saint-Loup-de-Troyes) near Troyes in Champagne, France, was established in the ninth century to shelter the relics of bishop Lupus of Troyes, Saint Loup, the legendary defender of the city against Attila in the fifth centuryThe relics were transported from  Saint Martin-ès-Aires, "Saint-Martin-in-the-Fields", also within the historical centre of Troyes. and patron of the city. The monastic community was reformed in 1135 by Bernard of Clairvaux, when the abbot and his monks embraced the Rule of Saint Augustine and became Canons Regular. The Abbaye Saint-Loup, which came to be enclosed within the burgeoning medieval city of Troyes, developed a renowned libraryFor the development and contents of the library: see C. Lalore, Inventaire, ccxxii-iv. and scriptorium. The famous poet Chrétien de Troyes may have been a canon of this monastic house.John F.

In the fifteenth century an imposing Flamboyant Gothic abbey church was erected; the abbey church was rededicated in 1425. The scholarly Petrus Comestor was an Augustinian canon of Saint-Loup, among his other benefices.Eric Leland Saak, High Way to Heaven: The Augustinian Platform Between Reform and Reformation (2002:179f)
The abbey's church and buildings, largely reconstructed in the seventeenth century, were destroyed during the Revolution;Precious manuscripts from the Saint-Loup library are conserved in the public library, Troyes, and a mid-fifteenth-century iron tabernacle door from the abbey came eventually to the Walters Collection, Baltimore, as one of Henry Walters' first medieval purchases, in 1899 (William R. Johnston, William and Henry Walters, the Reticent Collectors 1999:151). the only building left standing, in rue Chrestien de Troyes, was used to store books and manuscripts confiscated from neighbouring abbeys and convents, among which was the Abbey of Clairvaux. Thus a municipal public library in Troyes was first created.The library was rehoused in a modern structure in 2002. The Musée Saint Loup (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Archéologie et Histoire Naturelle) was also installed in the building, where it has remained since 1830.

Critical social work is the application of social work from a critical theory perspective. Critical social work seeks to address social injustices, as opposed to focusing on individual people's problems. Critical theories explain social problems as arising from various forms of oppression.
This theory is like all social work theories, in that it is made up of a polyglot of theories from across the humanities and sciences, borrowing from many different schools of thought, including marxism, social democracy and anarchism.Original material adapted from presentation by M.

Harvey's Lake or Harvey Lake is a lake in the town of Barnet, Vermont in Caledonia County in the northeast section of Vermont, United States. It was named after one of the original settlers of Barnet, Vermont, Colonel Alexander Harvey.[tpl]cite book|last=Child|first=Hamilton|title=Gazetteer of Caledonia and Essex Counties, VT: 1764-1887|publisher=Hamilton Child|year=1887|pages=133–151[/tpl] Although locally it has always been officially known as Harvey's Lake, it is officially named Harvey Lake by the United States Geological Survey as genitive apostrophes are rarely allowed in the names of natural features.http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS U.S. Board on Geographic Names FAQ, Section 18
The lake is surrounded to the northwest by the town of South Peacham, Vermont, to the south by Mosquitoville, Vermont, and to the east by Barnet Center, Vermont. The northern side produces a small channel near West Barnet, Vermont that is held back upstream by a dam, owned by the town of Barnet. Most of the lakefront is now dominated by Harvey's Lake Park with its public beaches and picnic areas, and a private campground.
Ocean explorer and SCUBA inventor Jacques Cousteau My Father, the Captain, by Jean-Michel Cousteau, National Geographic Books, 2010, p.21 had influential experiences on Harvey's Lake as a young boy in the early 1920s. While attending a summer camp he experimented with staying underwater by breathing through hollow reeds found in the lake shallows. Though he could not yet swim well, this allowed him to stay underwater for extended periods.

[[The Otterbury Incident]]

CATEGORIES: 1948 novels, British children's novels, 20th-century British children's literature

The Otterbury Incident is a novel for children by Cecil Day-Lewis first published in 1948 with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. Day-Lewis's second and final children's book, the novel is an adaptation of a French screenplay, Nous les gosses (Us Kids) which was filmed in 1941.
The novel is set in the immediate post-World War II period in the fictional English small provincial town of Otterbury. The town was largely untouched by the war apart from one accidental hit from a mis-targeted bomb which destroyed a few buildings near the centre of the town; schoolboy Nick Yates was pulled from the ruins and his parents were killed.  The bombsite is known locally as the "Incident" of the book's title, and is used as a site for war-games by two rival gangs of boys from the local King's School: Ted's Company, led by 13 year-old Edward Marshall, whose second-in-command is George, the narrator, and which includes Nick, Charlie Muswell and Young Wakeley, and the 'enemy' Toppy's Company, led by William Toppingham (also 13) and his sidekick Peter Butts, and including the ghastly Prune.  
After a battle during the school lunch-hour ("dinner-interval") in which Ted's Company have been declared victorious, the boys are wildly kicking a football to each other on the way back to school when Nick accidentally kicks it through one of the school windows. After owning up, he is ordered by the headmaster - a character much feared by the boys - to pay for the damage out of his own pocket. The sum concerned amounts to nearly five pounds (which would have been a reasonable weekly wage for an employed adult at the time and is far beyond the means of a schoolboy) and now Nick is an orphan he lives with his aunt and uncle who have no children of their own; they resent the unlooked-for responsibility and do not treat him well, and he cannot face confessing to them for fear of their reaction (when he finally does, he is severely punished and his uncle decides to sell Nick's puppy). 
Ted arouses a sense of collective responsibility for Nick's plight amongst the boys of both companies, in the spirit of 'One for all and all for one' from The Three Musketeers which their English teacher, Mr Richards ('Rickie' - "a decent chap, as schoolmasters go") is currently reading to them, because they were all involved in the irresponsible football-kicking.  The boys resolve to raise the money between them to pay for the damage. To this end, Ted and Toppy sign the Peace of Otterbury temporarily ending hostilities between the gangs and they join together to launch Operation Glazier; over a bank holiday weekend they carry out a variety of money-making schemes such as busking (led by Charlie Muswell), shoe-shining (with some illicit spraying of dirty water via a flit gun to increase trade), window-cleaning (Kwik-Klean Co.), an acrobat troupe, and lightning sketches by Toppy's sister (Miss E Toppingham, R.A.) to raise the money. 
Operation Glazier exceeds its target, but the money mysteriously disappears whilst in the charge of Ted and his grown-up sister, Rose, who looks after him. Toppy initially accuses Ted - who is ostracised by all but George and the ever-loyal Nick Yates - but then realises the real culprits are the deeply unpleasant local spiv Johnny Sharp and his seedy accomplice known as "The Wart".  The boys turn detective in order to try to recover the money, stalking the Wart (who is much the weaker character of the two) and trying to extract a confession from him, but Johnny Sharp interrupts the proceedings, threatens the boys with a cut-throat razor, and locks them in the tower of the local church.   
The boys escape and rethink their strategy to expose Sharp and the Wart; they have seen the men hanging out with a local merchant named Skinner and suspect that the missing money might be on Skinner's premises, just opposite the Incident (the boys are afraid of Skinner - "a whacking great bad-tempered thug of a man" - and avoid him as much as possible, though occasionally trespass into his yard as part of their war games). Ted and Toppy use the combat-planning skills they've developed during the games at the Incident to lead a well-planned raid on Skinner's warehouse where they uncover evidence of far more extensive criminal activities, including trading in black-market goods and production of counterfeit coinage. Skinner, Sharp, the Wart and a fourth accomplice (an 'unshaven type') return unexpectedly while Ted and Toppy are inside the warehouse. Toppy escapes but Ted is trapped and taken prisoner by Johnny Sharp.  The rest of the boys are still outside the yard, poised to attack:  George is sent off to get the police while the other boys start a pitched battle to rescue Ted, in which The Wart and Skinner are overpowered and trussed up.  Ted is saved thanks to Nick, who bravely attacks Sharp and is seriously injured in the process.  Sharp escapes on foot, pursued by the boys, and by this time, also the police - his attempt to get away in a dinghy up the river is brought to a prompt end by Peter Butts who launches a firework at the dinghy and capsizes it. 
The book ends at school assembly with the boys being simultaneously castigated for their illegal raid on Skinner's premises and their "disreputable" money-raising schemes, which are considered by the headmaster to be detrimental to the image of the school, and lauded as heroes for uncovering the criminals' operations by Inspector Brook.  The headmaster relents in the light of Inspector Brook's praise and says that the school will pay for the broken window (the missing money not having been recovered). The boys promise to leave any future criminal detection to the police. 
The book is written in the first person of George, a subordinate "officer" in one of the "armies" of the war games.

The concept is to compute short segments of yn of an arbitrary length L, and concatenate the segments together.  Consider a segment that begins at n = kL + M, for any integer k, and define:
Then, for kL + M  ≤  n  ≤  kL + L + M − 1, and equivalently M  ≤  n − kL  ≤  L + M − 1, we can write:
The task is thereby reduced to computing ykn, for M  ≤  n  ≤  L + M − 1.
Now note that if we periodically extend xkn with period N  ≥  L + M − 1, according to:

[[Wildcard mask]]

CATEGORIES: Routing, Network addressing, Internet architecture

A wildcard mask is a mask of bits that indicates which parts of an IP address are available for examination. In the Cisco IOS,Cisco Wide Area Application Services Command Reference Cisco Command Reference they are used in several places, for example:
At a simplistic level a wildcard mask can be thought of as an inverted subnet mask. For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (binary equivalent = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) inverts to a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255.
A wild card mask is a matching rule Matching Guide OmniSecu Site The rule for a wildcard mask is:
Any wildcard bit-pattern can be masked for examination: For example, a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.254 (binary equivalent = 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111110) will allow even-numbered IP addresses to be examined. A 0 octet in the wildcard mask indicates that the corresponding octet in the network must match exactly. On the other hand, a 254 indicates that you don't care what the corresponding octet is in the network except for the host(255) bit.
A network and wildcard mask combination of 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 would match an interface configured exactly with 1.1.1.1 only, and nothing else. This is really useful if you want to activate OSPF on a specific interface in a very clear and simple way. 
If you insist on matching a range of networks, the network and wildcard mask combination of 1.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 would match any interface in the range of 1.1.0.0 to 1.1.255.255. Because of this, it's simpler and safer to stick to using wildcard masks of 0.0.0.0 and identify each OSPF interface individually, but once configured, they function exactly the same- one way is not better than the other.
Wildcard masks are used in situations where subnet masks may not apply. For example, when two affected hosts fall in different subnets, the use of a wildcard mask will group them together.

CATEGORIES: Natural gas-fired power stations in Lithuania, Oil-fired power stations in Lithuania, Power stations in Elektrėnai, Power stations built in the Soviet Union

The Elektrėnai Power Plant or Lithuania Power Plant ([tpl]lang-lt|Lietuvos elektrinė[/tpl]) is an 1,800-MW electrical generating station near Elektrėnai, Lithuania, about [tpl]convert|50|km[/tpl] west of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius.  It is operated by Lietuvos Elektrinė, a subsidiary of Lietuvos Energija.
The plant was built in stages between 1960 and 1972. The Strėva River was dammed to supply it with cooling water, creating the Elektrėnai Reservoir. As of 2008 the plant comprised eight units fired with natural gas, heavy fuel oil, and a bitumen-based fuel known as Orimulsion, imported from Venezuela. It was designed as a base load plant, and generated about 10 TWh per year until 1992. Its operations were then reduced to about 5% of its capacity, since it acted only as a reserve in the Lithuanian power system.
After the shutdown of the Ignalina nuclear power plant in 2009, the plant became the primary source of Lithuania's electrical power. Since the plant does not meet European Union environmental guidelines, a number of improvement projects have been proposed. A flue-gas desulfurization project was completed in September 2008.  In December 2007, Economy Ministry Undersecretary Arturas Dainius announced that a new 400-MW combined cycle unit would be built at the site as well. The cost of the new unit was estimated at 252 million euros; 57% of the funding will be supplied by the European Union, 33% by the plant, and the remaining 10% by the National Ignalina Decommissioning Fund.[tpl]cite news|title=EU grants EUR 50 mln for upgrading of Lithuanian Power Plant|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/2323/|publisher=Lithuania in the European Union|agency = BNS|date=2007-12-20|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]
The plant also supplies district heating to the town of Elektrėnai, established in 1962 to support its workers.
An interesting feature is that two of the three chimneys of EPP serve also as electricity pylons.

Jean-Baptiste Landé (died 26 February 1748) was a French ballet dancer, active in Sweden, Denmark and Russia. He is the founder of the Russian Ballet Mariinsky Ballet.
Landé was employed at the Polish royal court in Dresden when he was engaged by king Frederick I of Sweden in 1721. He was appointed dancing master of the Swedish court, and in 1723 he became the director of the French Opera-Theatre in Bollhuset in Stockholm, which he named L'Académie royale de musique et de danse. In 1726, he was a guest ballet master at the first theatre in Denmark, the Lille Grönnegade theatre (1722-1728), where he performed with his wife. He left Sweden in 1728, after a conflict with Charles Langlois (actor), who intruded on his theatre privilege by arranging his own plays at Bollhuset. He went to Denmark, where the only previous theatre had been closed in 1728, and tried to start his own theatre, but theatre was banned in Denmark in 1730-1746, and he supported himself as a dance teacher.
In 1734 he was invited to Russia, where he was made dance master at the military academy. After a ballet performance for Empress Anna in 1735, the Russian Ballet School was established in 1738 with Landé as its ballet master. He educated the first dancers in Russia, which were taken from the staff at the royal palace: Timofei Bublikov, Nikolai Choglokov, Afanasy Toporkov, Ivan Shatilov, Nikolai Tolubeyev, Sergei Chalyshkin, Andrei Samarin and Andrei Nesterov, and among the females Yelizaveta, Avdotia Timofeyeva and Axiniaya Sergeyeva.
Landé was the dance instructor of Catherine the Great after her arrival in Russia in 1744.

[[Mettelhorn]]

CATEGORIES: Mountains of Switzerland, Mountains of the Alps, Alpine three-thousanders, Mountains of Valais

The Mettelhorn is a mountain of the Swiss Pennine Alps, located near Zermatt in the canton of Valais.
The Mettelhorn provides excellent acclimatization opportunities, especially if one climbs its sister peaks Platthorn and Wisshorn on the same day. Hiking from Zermatt to the Mettelhorn takes about six hours uphill and four hours downwards. The summit can be reached by almost any active hiker with some mountain experience.
The climb to the Mettelhorn begins from Zermatt; hikers start on the Edelweiss path, the path goes through a forest before coming to the Edelweiss Restaurant; this section takes about one hour. The forest section ends here and a wider gorge opens as the path runs past the Triftbach river. There are also plenty of signs with photos about the wildflowers growing on the paths' surroundings. After the Edelweiss, another 90 minutes of hiking leads to the Hotel Trift; the path is easy to follow and scenery rich with a few mountain views. One can see the Unter Gabelhorn mountain on the left side with several smaller peaks. After the Hotel Trift the path veers left towards north east going towards Zinal Rothorn, Platthorn and Mettelhorn mountains. The path going on the Rothornhütte (the SAC hut at the foot of the Zinal Rothorn) turns soon towards off the main path north westwards (all turnings are well signed), and an additional path leads south east towards the Wisshorn. 
After one hour of ascent from the Hotel Trift the Triftchumme meadow appears, where occasionally sheep graze. At the other side of meadow is the Platthorn. Eventually one comes on the saddle called Furggi pass. From here one can see the Mettelhorn and decide if to climb the Platthorn or to go over the Hohlicht Gletscher glacier first. Going up on the Platthorn takes about 30 minutes. On the north side is the Unter Äschorn and also the Weisshorn can be seen. The Glacier is steep and crampons are recommended, even through the glacier does not provide major difficulties to walk over; the Glacier section takes about 30 minutes. The Mettelhorn has a steep face but can be walked up; scree can give some trouble on the way up. The views from the summit are spectacular. On the top of the mountain one can see more famous mountains like; Weisshorn, Dom, Monte Rosa, the North Face of the Matterhorn, Ober Gabelhorn and Zinal Rothorn.

[[List of Denver Broncos seasons]]

CATEGORIES: Denver Broncos seasons, National Football League teams seasons

thumb|Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where the Broncos have played their home games since 2001The Denver Broncos are an American football franchise. They are members of the American Football Conference West Division (AFC West) of the American Football Conference (AFC) of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents their season-by-season records from 1960 to the present day, including post-season records, and league awards for individual players and head coaches. As of the end of the 2012 season, the team has completed 53 seasons and will be entering their 54th at the start of the 2013 season. The Broncos franchise was founded on August 14, 1959 by Bob Howsam and played their first season in 1960, in Denver, Colorado as part of the original American Football League (AFL). The Broncos are 6–4. They became part of the NFL in [tpl]nfly|1970[/tpl] after the AFL-NFL merger.[tpl]cite web | title = Denver Broncos | publisher = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=10 | accessdate = July 9, 2008 [/tpl]
The franchise has experienced two major periods of success. The first was from [tpl]nfly|1976[/tpl] to [tpl]nfly|1981[/tpl], when the Broncos did not have a losing season (a season when the team has more losses than wins), and won two AFC West division titles, and one AFC championship. The second began in [tpl]nfly|1983[/tpl] and ended in [tpl]nfly|1998[/tpl]. During this period, the Broncos had just two losing seasons, were AFC champions five times and Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years. This second period of success is best remembered for John Elway being the team's quarterback.[tpl]cite web | title = John Elway | publisher = Pro Football Hall of Fame | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=64 | accessdate = July 17, 2008 [/tpl] The Denver Broncos have also experienced one notable period of deterioration. From their inaugural season in 1960 until [tpl]nfly|1975[/tpl], they did not make the playoffs and had just two winning seasons. The Broncos were the only charter AFL franchise to never have a winning season during the AFL's 10 years of existence, with their first winning season not occurring until 1973, their fourth year as a member of the NFL's American Conference.  They also experienced their two seasons with the most losses ever, winning just two of fourteen games in both [tpl]nfly|1963[/tpl] and [tpl]nfly|1964[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | title = Denver Broncos Franchise Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | url = http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/ | accessdate = April 28, 2008 [/tpl] 
The Broncos have been AFC West champions eleven times, and have also earned wild card berths into the playoffs seven times. They have been conference champions six times and Super Bowl champions twice. However, the Broncos did not make the AFL playoffs prior to the merger in 1970. As of the end of the 2012 season, the Broncos have played over 800 regular and post-season games in 53 seasons, and have appeared in the post-season nineteen times.

[[Displacement (ship)]]
CATEGORIES: Water transport, Shipbuilding, Nautical terms, Ship measurements

A ship's displacement or displacement tonnage, a term usually applied only to naval vessels, is the weight of the water that a ship displaces when it is floating. The term is defined ordinarily such that the ship's fuel tanks are full and all stores are aboard. Displacement is the actual weight of the ship, since a floating body displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle).Dear and Kemp, 2006, p.588George, 2005, p. 68. Another way of thinking about displacement is the weight of the water that would spill out of a completely filled container were the ship placed into it.
A number of synonymous terms exist for this maximum weight, such as loaded displacement, full load displacement and designated displacement.Turpin and McEwen, 1980. As a measurement of weight, displacement should not be confused with similarly named measurements of volume or capacity such as net tonnage, gross tonnage, or deadweight tonnage.
The density (weight per unit of volume) of water can vary. For example, the average density of seawater at the surface of the ocean is 1025 kg/m³ (10.25 lb/ga, 8.55 lb/US gallon); fresh water on the other hand has a density of about 1000 kg/m³ (10.00 lb/ga, 8.35 lb/US gallon). Consider a 100-ton ship passing from a saltwater sea into a freshwater river. It always displaces exactly 100 tons of water, but it has to displace a greater volume of fresh water to amount to 100 tons. Therefore it would sit slightly lower in the water in the freshwater river than it would in the saltwater sea.
It can be useful to know a ship's displacement when it is unloaded or loaded partially.  Terms for these measurements include light displacement, standard displacement,  and normal displacement.  These terms are defined below.

[[United States presidential election in Rhode Island, 1964]]
CATEGORIES: United States presidential elections in Rhode Island, United States presidential election, 1964, Rhode Island elections, 1964

The 1964 United States presidential election in Rhode Island took place on November 3, 1964 as part of the 1964 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all 50 states and D.C. Voters chose 4 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Rhode Island voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic nominee, incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, over the Republican nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Johnson ran with incumbent Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, while Goldwater's running mate was Congressman William E. Miller of New York.
Johnson carried Rhode Island in a mega landslide, taking 80.87% of the vote to Goldwater's 19.13%, a Democratic victory margin of 61.74%. This made Rhode Island Lyndon Johnson's strongest state in the nation.
Even in the midst of a massive nationwide Democratic landslide, Rhode Island weighed in as 39% more Democratic than the national average in the 1964 election.
The staunch conservative Barry Goldwater was widely seen in the Northeastern United States as a right-wing extremist; he had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Johnson campaign portrayed him as a warmonger who as president would provoke a nuclear war. While John F. Kennedy had won 63.63% in Rhode Island in 1960 mostly by sweeping the ethnic Catholic vote, in 1964, this traditional Democratic coalition was joined by mass defections of moderate Yankee Republicans who had voted for Eisenhower and Nixon but could not support the extremist Goldwater. Consequently, the incumbent Johnson was able to take more than 80% of the vote in liberal Rhode Island.
Johnson swept all 5 counties in Rhode Island with over 70% of the vote. In Providence County, the most populated county, home to the state's capital and largest city, Providence, Johnson took an epic 83.5% of the vote. This was the strongest showing ever for a Democratic presidential candidate in Providence.
Johnson's 80.87% remains the highest vote share percentage any presidential candidate of either party has ever received in Rhode Island, and his 61.74% victory margin remains the widest margin by which any candidate of either party has ever won the state.

[[Bodorna]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Mtskheta-Mtianeti

Bodorna ([tpl]lang-ka|ბოდორნა[/tpl]) is a small village in Georgia, situated on the Georgian Military Road, 8 km from the town of Dusheti, Mtskheta-Mtianeti region, in the east of the country.  
Bodorna lies on the right bank of the small river Dushetis-Khevi, a right tributary to the Aragvi River, at an elevation of 880 m. above sea level. The village was fortified in the Middle Ages in a way to accommodate the fugitives from nearby locales during foreign incursions. Thus, the man-hewn caves at Bodorna are known to have served as a shelter for the populace of the Aragvi valley when the Turco-Mongol army of Timur penetrated the Georgian highlands in the 1390s. 
South of the village is a 15 m. high column whose origin is not completely clear. It resembles a human figure, that of a monk, and  may be a man-made structure, hewed from a natural, denudational relict, for cult purposes in the early Christian period, possibly the 5th-6th centuries. The column contains a large cave, one of those that were utilized as a shelter during Timur’s invasion. According to a medieval chronicle, the soldiers of Timur descended the column using ropes and shoot fiery arrows into the crowded cave.  
Bodorna is a home to a 15th-century Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God, which then served as a familial abbey and a burial ground for the Dukes of Aragvi of the Shaburidze family. It was almost completely rebuild in 1717 as revealed by a contemporaneous inscription. The extant structure is a single-nave domed church erected on a woody hill (pictured).[tpl]ka icon[/tpl] "Bodorna", in: Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia, vol. 2, p. 442. Tbilisi, 1977.[/ref]

[[Kirkjuból witch trial]]

CATEGORIES: History of Iceland, Witch trials, 1656 in law

The Kirkjuból witch trial was perhaps the best-known witch trial in Iceland. It took place in Kirkjuból in 1656, in what is today Ísafjörður.
The plaintiff in the trial was pastor Jón Magnússon, who had been suffering poor health since 1654. He contended that his illness, as well as what he described as demonic disturbances in his household and in the surrounding district, were brought on by sorcery practiced by two members of his own congregation, who also sang in the choir, a father and son both named Jón Jónsson. The elder Jón confessed to owning a book about magic and that he had used it against Jón Magnússon. The son also confessed to having made the pastor ill and of having used magical signs and farting runes (Fretrúnir) against a girl. (The curse of farting was intended to be relentless; to not only humiliate the victim, but also to bring about chronic abdominal discomfort and weakness).
Both father and son were found guilty of sorcery and were executed by burning at the stake. After they were executed, the priest was awarded all their material holdings. Claiming that the disturbances and sicknesses did not cease, he then accused a Thuridur Jónsdóttir, the daughter/sister of the Jónssons, of witchcraft. The case was brought to Thingvellir, was dismissed and the woman let free. She later countersued for wrongful persecution and was vindicated. She was awarded the pastor's belongings as compensation.[tpl]cite book|last=Hastrup|first=Kirsten|title=Early Modern European Witchcraft|date=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198203888|page=393-401|editor=Bengt Ankarloo, Gustav Henningsen|chapter=Iceland: Sorcerers and Paganism[/tpl]  In Iceland, magic was often practiced and not necessarily associated with the Devil, but the religious and secular authorities, influenced directly or indirectly by Denmark and Germany, had a different view on the subject.

[[Shaburidze]]

CATEGORIES: Noble families of Georgia (country), Georgian-language surnames

The Shaburidze ([tpl]lang-ka|შაბურიძე[/tpl]) were a Georgian noble family, which claimed descent from the Sassanid dynasty of ancient Persia and to which belonged the Duchy of Aragvi from the 13th century to the 15th. 
According to traditional accounts, the family descended from a high-ranking captive Muslim prince, possibly of the Shaddadid house, brought in Georgia by King George III in the 1060s. The family, in the person of Mihai Shaburisdze, is first mentioned in a document of 1380.Allen, W.E.D. (1964), Trivia Historiae Ibericae, 2-4. Bedi Kartlisa, 17-18; 45-46: p. 166. 
The Shaburidze were enfeoffed by the Georgian crown with a duchy in the upper Aragvi valley in northeast Georgia, and grew influential enough to produce dynastic marriages with the Royal House of Georgia. Thus, an unnamed noblewoman of the Shaburidze clan became the queen consort of Vakhtang III of Georgia (r. 1301-1307), while a daughter of George VIII of Georgia, previously betrothed to Constantine XI Palaeologus, the last Byzantine emperor, who perished in the fall of Constantinople, subsequently married Giorgi Shaburidze, son of Vameq, Duke of Aragvi, as is revealed by the latter's charter of 1465. By the late 15th century, however, the family had twice lost their duchy, the last time permanently and to the House of Tumanidze, for in his charter of June 28, 1474, granted to the church of the Nativity of Our Lady at Bodorna, Vameq Shaburidze refers to himself as "duke in name only."Toumanoff, Cyril (1949–51).

[[Pobull Fhinn]]

CATEGORIES: Stone circles in Scotland, Archaeological sites in the Outer Hebrides, North Uist

Pobull Fhìnn is a stone circle on the Isle of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides.  The name is Gaelic.  The first word has been variously spelt as "pobull", "poball", "pobul" or as plural "pobuill".  The modern standard spelling would be "Poball Fhìnn".  The phrase can be translated as "Fionn's people," or "the white/fair people."  The plural form "Pobuill Fhìnn" can be translated as "Fionn's peoples" and is unlikely to be correct.
The stones were probably named after the legendary Gaelic hero Fionn mac Cumhaill known in English as Finn or Fingal.  The present title may constitute a modern rationalisation of a word now obsolete in colloquial Scottish Gaelic: "Pùball Fhìnn" (Fionn's tent) was a common phrase in the ancient Fenian cycle of Gaelic lore and indicated his nomadic residence.
The stones are also known as "Sòrnach Coir' Fhìnn," or "the fireplace of Fionn's cauldron" and locally as "Sòrnach a' Phobaill" (the fireplace of the People).  The former name is similar to that of Sòrnaichean Coir' Fhìnn (the fireplaces of Fionn's cauldron) near Kensaleyre in Skye and Suidhe Coire Fhionn (the site of Fionn's cauldron) in Arran.  "Coire Fhìnn" (Fionn's cauldron) was used to cook the deer that he and his fellow hunters had killed.
Of the several stone circles on the island, Pobull Fhìnn is the most conspicuous.  It is located on the south side of Ben Langass, and it possibly dates from the second millennium BC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.details_gis?inumlink=10237 |title=North Uist, Ben Langass, Pobull Fhinn |accessdate=2008-04-28 |format= |work= [/tpl]  It is technically an oval rather than a circle, measuring about 120 feet from east to west and 93 feet from north to south.  Although situated on a natural plateau, the north side of the enclosed area has been excavated to about four feet.  At least two dozen stones can be counted, some eight on the northern half and 16 on the southern half, but parts of the circle are devoid of stones.  About four feet within the circle at the east side is a tall single stone, and there are two fallen slabs about seven feet beyond the western edge. 
Pobull Fhìnn is located at grid reference NF 8427 6502 [tpl]coord|57|33|52|N|7|16|57|W[/tpl].  It can be reached from a footpath beginning near the Langass Lodge Hotel.  Alternatively, it can be reached from the footpath to Barpa Langass that starts from the A867 about five miles southwest of Lochmaddy; Barpa Langass is a 0.75-mile walk up Ben Langass from Pobull Fhìnn.  The jagged shapes of the stones silhouetted against Loch Langass, Loch Eport, and Eaval make Pobull Fhinn one of the most visited and most photographed sites on North Uist.

[[List of Texas Revolution battles]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of battles, Texas Revolution

Multiple battles of the Texas Revolution took place between October 2, 1835 and April 21, 1836.  The Texas Revolution was fought between Mexico and rebellious colonists in Mexican Texas.  All of these battles were fought within the territory of Texas.
In early 1835, Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna began centralizing power and operating as a dictator.  Federalists throughout the country revolted; in Texas, an armed uprising began on October 2 when settlers refused to return a small cannon to Mexican troops. This Battle of Gonzales ended with Mexican troops retreating empty handed to San Antonio de Bexar (now the U.S. city of San Antonio, Texas).  Emboldened by their victory, the Texians formed a volunteer army. A small force of Texians travelled down the Texas coastline, defeating Mexican troops at Goliad and at Fort Lipantitlán. The majority of the Texian troops followed General Stephen F. Austin to Bexar, where they initiated a siege of the Mexican garrison. After victories in several skirmishes, including the Battle of Concepción and the Grass Fight, the Texians attacked Bexar. After several days of fighting, the Siege of Bexar ended with the surrender of Mexican general Martin Perfecto de Cos. With the parole of Cos's troops back to Mexico in mid-December, seven Mexican forces remained in Texas.
Many Texians believed the war was now over, and the majority of the settlers returned to their homes.  The remaining troops were garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in Bexar and at Presidio La Bahia in Goliad. In early January, a large number of the remaining soldiers, most of them adventurers recently arrived from the United States, began clamoring to invade Mexico. Colonel Frank W. Johnson and Dr. James Grant began preparing to attack Matamoros.  
Even before Cos's defeat, Santa Anna had been making plans to retake Texas. In January, he led the "Army of Operations in Texas" towards the rebellious territory. At the Rio Grande, the army divided; Santa Anna led the bulk of the troops toward Bexar, where he laid siege to the Alamo.  The remaining troops, under General Jose de Urrea, traveled up the coastline, easily defeating Johnson and Grant at the battles of San Patricio and Agua Dulce. News of these first Mexican victories cheered the Mexican force gathered at Bexar. On March 6, Santa Anna ordered an assault on the Alamo; all but a few of the defenders were killed. News of the Texian defeat and approach of the Mexican army terrified the settlers; in an event later known as the Runaway Scrape, settlers, the Texas government, and the remnants of the Texian army under the command of Sam Houston fled east, away from the approaching army. Houston ordered Colonel James Fannin to abandon Goliad and join his retreat. However, Fannin delayed his departure and sent a quarter of his troops to help evacuate the settlers at Refugio. Centralist forces in the area were stronger than the Texians expected at Refugio and defeated them. After receiving word of the defeat, Fannin finally began his retreat. His men were quickly overtaken and surrounded by Mexican soldiers. Fannin fought courageously at the Battle of Coleto, but was forced to surrender. He and his 300 men were taken prisoner, but just days later were executed in the Goliad Massacre. 
The only remaining Texian troops were those retreating with Houston. After learning that Santa Anna had again divided his forces, Houston ordered an attack on April 21, 1836. Crying "Remember the Alamo" and "Remember Goliad", the Texians showed little mercy during the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was captured in hiding the following day and he ordered his army to return to Mexico, ending the Texas Revolution.

The Dark Harvest Commando was a militant group which in 1981 demanded that the British government decontaminate Gruinard Island, a site which had been used for anthrax weapon testing during World War II.
The group placed a container of soil outside the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire.  A second container of soil was placed at Blackpool, a resort town where the Conservative Party was holding a conference.  The first package was found to contain Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax), while the second was uncontaminated, but of the same soil type as found on the island.
One news source claimed that a resurgent DHC (possibly affiliated with the Scottish National Liberation Army) collected spores from Gruinard Island for an attack on Prince William in December, 2001.Nick Drainey SNLA Threats and Attacks The Scotsman. 4 Mar 2002.

The collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an oral tradition in the Coptic language, they were only later written down as Greek text.

The Gila Valley Arizona Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the town of Central between the communities of Pima and Thatcher in Arizona.  The temple was dedicated on May 23, 2010, following an open house period from April 23 to May 15.
The announcement of the temple on April 26, 2008 came concurrently with the Gilbert Arizona Temple, and together were the first new temples announced since Thomas S. Monson assumed responsibilities as the president of the LDS Church.[tpl]cite news |first=Mike |last=Branom |title=New Mormon temple slated for Gilbert |url= http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114955 |publisher= East Valley Tribune |date= 2008-04-27 |accessdate=2008-04-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429141617/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114955  |archivedate = 2008-04-29[/tpl]
Local church leadership announced on September 21, 2008 that the temple would be built on church owned property adjacent to US Route 70 in the unincorporated community of Central.  A petition to grant an exception to building height restrictions to accommodate a [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] steeple for the temple was given a favorable recommendation by the Graham County Planning and Zoning Commission and was subsequently approved by the county board of supervisors on October 20.[tpl]cite news |title= Temple could be in Central |newspaper= Eastern Arizona Courier |date= 2008-09-29 |accessdate= 2008-09-30 |last= Saunders |first= Diane |url= http://www.eacourier.com/news/temple-could-be-in-central/article_152b2d41-4236-5841-8485-dd1ab37305fe.html [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Supervisors approve prelim plat for Sierra Del Sol |newspaper= Eastern Arizona Courier |date= 2008-10-22 |accessdate= 2008-10-23 |last= Saunders |first= Diane |url= http://www.eacourier.com/news/supervisors-approve-prelim-plat-for-sierra-del-sol/article_7acf3ec6-a50e-5036-a3cb-2aa6130c258b.html [/tpl]

The new temple serves the significant Latter-day Saint population in the eastern part of Arizona's Gila River Valley, who previously had to travel to the Mesa Arizona Temple, 150 miles to the west.  The area has a historical significance to the LDS Church; Thatcher, which was founded by Mormon pioneers in 1881, was home to former LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball during his youth in the early part of the 1900s.[tpl]cite news |title= LDS Church announces two new temples in Arizona |url= http://www.sltrib.com/lds/ci_9071215?source=rss |newspaper=  The Salt Lake Tribune |date= April 27, 2008 |accessdate= 2012-10-15 [/tpl]   Speculation that the area would be home to a temple was made as early as 1882, when Jesse N.

Pizzo Rotondo is a mountain in the Lepontine Alps. At 3,190 metres above sea level, it is the highest mountain lying on the border between the cantons of Ticino and Valais, as well as the highest summit of the Lepontine Alps lying between Nufenen Pass and Lukmanier Pass.
The massif of Piz Rotondo separates the valleys of the upper Rhone (Valais) and upper Ticino. About two kilometres north-east lies the Witenwasserenstock, which is the watershed between the basins of the Rhone, Po and Rhine.
On the north side lies a relatively large glacier named Gerengletscher, which extends to the ridge of the Witenwasserenstock. On the south side, at Passo di Rotondo, lies a smaller glacier named Ghiacciaio del Pizzo Rotondo.
The first ascent by Viktor Haller and his guides on August 5, 1869, started from Bedretto in Ticino over the east face and the (by now nearly gone) Pesciora glacier. Only four days later, the second ascent took place, this time from the other site. F. Schläpfer and his guides  Rudolf Elmer and Johann Kreuzer, started from Oberwald, and made the first ascent of the north summit via the long Geren valley and the Geren glacier. Only Elmer and Kreuzer traversed to the somewhat higher southern summit.

Jones went through an incredible journey just to get to Oakland Hills. He had won four PGA Tour events, the last in 1989, but in November 1991 he was involved in a dirt bike accident that threatened to end his career. He separated his shoulder and sprained an ankle, as well as suffering ligament damage in his index finger. Jones was sidelined for three years, not making it back on tour until 1994. His win here came in his first U.S. Open since 1991, and he was the first champion to go through sectional qualifying since tour rookie Jerry Pate in 1976. After this win, Jones won three more times on tour.
This was the eighth major championship at the South Course, which previously hosted the U.S. Open in 1924, 1937, 1951, 1961, and 1985, and the PGA Championship in 1972 and 1979.  It later hosted the PGA Championship in 2008.

The 1995 U.S. Open was the 95th U.S. Open, held June 15–18 at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. In the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Open, Corey Pavin won his only major championship, two strokes ahead of runner-up Greg Norman.
Norman began the tournament with rounds of 68-67 before falling back to 74 in the third round, while Tom Lehman fired a third-round 67 to tie Norman for the 54-hole lead. Pavin was three back after rounds of 72-69-71. Norman and Lehman were still tied at the turn, but then Lehman bogeyed 11 and Norman bogeyed 12. Pavin had recorded a birdie at 12, which brought him into a tie with Norman, Lehman, and Bob Tway. Norman and Tway each then suffered bogeys, while Pavin took sole possession of the lead with a birdie at 15. Even with a Norman birdie at the 15th, his first since the opening hole of the third round, nobody could catch Pavin. He sealed the victory with a 4-wood approach to the 18th, running across the fairway as the ball was in the air and raising his hands in triumph after it landed on the green. He carded a 68 and a 280 total, two shots ahead of Norman, who shot a 73.
In the final round, Neal Lancaster set a new tournament record with a 29 on the back-nine. Tiger Woods, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, played in his first U.S. Open but withdrew during the second round with a wrist injury.
This was the third U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills; it previously hosted in 1896 and 1986. It returned nine years later in 2004.

William "Wee Willie" Crilley (born 1903 in Cowcaddens, Scotland; 1955 in New York City) was a Scottish-American football (soccer) forward who holds the record for the greatest number of goals scored by an Alloa Athletic player in a single season of the Scottish Football League. He had an itinerant career, spending most of it in the United States with a few seasons, or bits of seasons in Scotland.
During his youth, Crilley played for Pale Ale, a local Glasgow amateur team. In 1920, he began the season with Cambuslang Rangers F.C. Durin the season, he moved to Alloa Athletic of the Scottish Football League Second Division. In his first season with Alloa, he scored the game winners in Alloa's first and second round victories in the Scottish Cup. He also scored in the third round replay with Rangers F.C., a 4–1 loss for Alloa. Despite the loss in the Scottish Cup, Alloa won the 1921 Penman Trophy and Stirlingshire Cup. The next year, Crilley carried Alloa to the Second Division championship as he scored a record forty-nine goals, an amazing feat for a five-foot three center forward. Alloa transferred Crilley to Celtic at the end of the season, but he played only three first team games, scoring a single goal. Celtic sent him back to Alloa at the end of the season, but injuries hindered his playing time.Alloa Athletic History 
He then left Scotland to sign with New York Field Club in the American Soccer League which had not yet finished its season. He played five games, scoring five goals. Crilley began the 1923–1924 season in New York, played two league games, one National Challenge Cup game before being transferred to the New York Giants. He played two games, scoring one goal, then returned to Scotland to rejoin Alloa.[tpl]cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921–1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) [/tpl] According to the Alloa history, he was “transferred down south for £1,250” but it does not identify Crilley's new team. However, at some point he returned to the United States where he played eleven games of the 1924–1925 season with Indiana Flooring. 
Crilley returned to the Giants for the 1925–1926 season, seeing his greatest number of games during any stint with a US team, twenty-eight. By this time, he was no longer a center forward and had become better known as a top winger and an excellent play maker. Crilley resumed his nomadic career during the 1926–1927 season, bouncing between three teams during the course of the season. He began with the Giants, played nine games for J&P Coats and finished with two games at Philadelphia Field Club. He then played for the New York Nationals in 1927–1928. In the 1928–1929 season, he was with Brooklyn Hispano, New York Hungaria and the IRT Rangers of the Eastern Professional Soccer League.The Year in American Soccer – 1929April 22, 1929 The Globe 
He apparently returned to Scotland intending to play for Alloa Athletic, but was deported from Scotland because he had become a US citizen. Therefore, he was back into the ASL in the fall of 1930 with the Newark Americans and the New York Soccer Club. While he played only one league game with New York SC, he saw another five cup games in which he scored seven goals. He continued his itinerant ways in 1931, playing for both the Fall River F.C. and the Brooklyn Wanderers before joining the New York American in the fall of 1931. Crilley replicated his early career goal scoring heroics for these last two teams, scoring 14 goals in 7 games for Brooklyn and 9 goals in 10 games for the Americans. In 1932, he attempted to rejoin Alloa Athletic, but was rebuffed. In 1935, he played for Brooklyn Hispano in the second American Soccer League.
He returned to the United States and joined the US Army on 18 November 1942, serving in the Air Corps with Fifteenth Air Force during World War II.

[[The Delta Rhythm Boys]]
CATEGORIES: American vocal groups, Musical groups from Oklahoma, Musical groups established in 1934, Langston University, RCA Victor artists

The Delta Rhythm Boys were an American vocal group active for over 50 years from 1934 to 1987. The group was first formed at Langston University in Langston, Oklahoma, in 1934 by Elmaurice Miller, Traverse Crawford, Essie Joseph Adkins, and Otha Lee Gaines. In 1936, they moved to Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they worked under Frederick Hall under the names, New Orleans Quintet and Frederick Hall Quintet. Clinton Holland (soon replaced by Carl Jones) and Kelsey Pharr (replaced by Hugh Bryant in 1962) replaced Miller and Adkins. Rene DeKnight became their pianist.
The group appeared often in the 1940s on radio programs such as Amos and Andy and The Joan Davis Show, and performed on Broadway in the shows, Sing Out the News and Hot Mikado. They also appeared extensively in film, including in You'll Never Get Rich with Bing Crosby and Rita Hayworth. Aside from their own recordings, they served as background vocalists for Charlie Barnet, Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, and Ruth Brown.
One of their most successful releases was a vocal version of the Glenn Miller instrumental hit "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Harlem" from 1941 with lyrics by Buddy Feyne and music by Glenn Miller Orchestra arranger and composer Jerry Gray, Ben Smith, and Leonard Ware.
Also memorable is their 1950s version of the spiritual song "Dem Bones", a hit record for them, and which they performed on television extensively, and is currently revived with at least two postings on You Tube.
In the 1950s, they began to amass a large fan base in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia. In 1956, the group relocated to Europe and performed there up until 1987, when Gaines and Bryant died.
In 1960, Kelsey Pharr died in Honolulu after a trip to Japan. Soon after, Carl Jones left to have more time with his family and was replaced by first tenor Herb Coleman. Hugh Bryant replaced Pharr.
With the American music scene changing rapidly, the Deltas found their appeal diminishing. Overseas, they were royally received, however, so in the early 1960s the group made Paris their home base for years of European performances.
In 1974, Herb Coleman was shot in Paris and died in the arms of Lee Gaines. Original Delta member, Traverse Crawford, died the following year. By 1979, the lineup was Gaines on bass, Bryant on baritone, Walter Trammell on first tenor, and Ray Beauty on second tenor. Lee Gaines died of cancer in Helsinki on July 15, 1987.Obituaries: Lee Gaines, 73, a Jazz Singer New York Times, July 21, 1987. At Gaines's funeral, Hugh Bryant collapsed while performing, and died, apparently from a heart attack.Obituaries: Hugh Bryant Dies as He Sings Tribute at Lee Gaines Funeral New York Times, July 24, 1987.
The Delta Rhythm Boys were later inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

The 1992 U.S. Open was the 92nd U.S. Open, held June 18–21 at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California. Tom Kite, long considered one of the best players to never win a major, finally broke through with a U.S. Open title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Jeff Sluman.
Gil Morgan was the story of the opening two rounds. He took the first-round lead with a 66, then recorded a second-round 69 for the 36-hole lead. After a birdie at the 3rd hole of the third round, Morgan was at 10-under, becoming the first in U.S. Open history to reach double-digits under-par. He got as low as 12-under after a birdie at the 7th, but then collapsed. He made three double-bogeys the rest of the round, but still held the lead by one over Kite, Ian Woosnam, and Mark Brooks. Morgan finally fell out of the lead after a double-bogey at the 6th in the final round. He eventually finished in 13th place, playing his final 29 holes in 17-over par. As Morgan was falling, Kite played steady golf, recording two birdies at 12 and 14 to offset bogeys at 16 and 17. He finished with an even-par 72 and a 3-under total of 285 for a two-stroke win over Jeff Sluman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usopen.com/en_US/champ_experience/pastchamps/1992.html|publisher=USGA|title=U.S. Open history: 1992|accessdate=June 24, 2012[/tpl]
Windy conditions combined with lightning-fast greens made scoring conditions in the final round extremely difficult. Morgan shot an 81, Woosnam, one back at the start of the round, shot 79, and Nick Faldo, two back at the start, carded a 77.

CATEGORIES: 1961 births, 2006 deaths, Poets from Georgia (country), Composers from Georgia (country), Male singers from Georgia (country), Rock musicians from Georgia (country), People from Tbilisi

Irakli Charkviani ([tpl]lang-ka|ირაკლი ჩარკვიანი[/tpl]; November 19, 1961 – February 24, 2006), sometimes known under his pseudonym Mefe (მეფე, "The King"), was a Georgian poet, prose writer, and musician. Charkviani was known for his eccentric image and poetry, and for eclectic music, which spanned alternative rock, electronic music and hip hop.
Charkviani was born into an élite family in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia. His father, the journalist and diplomat Gela Charkviani was Georgia’s former ambassador to the United Kingdom, and grandfather Candide Charkviani was the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Georgian SSR Communist Party from 1938 to 1952. His greatgrandfather was a prominent Georgian artist Mose Toidze.
Charkviani graduated from the Department of Western European and American Literature, Tbilisi State University. His debut in 1976, with the indie rock project Arishi, passed unnoticed, but the later band Taxi had a greater success and recorded the homonymous album in 1988. In the 1980s, several of Charkviani’s lyrics and short stories, noted for their rebellious character, were published in Georgian literary press. Early in the 1990s, Charkviani emerged as one of the leading artists on Georgia’s alternative and electronic scene. Leading the projects Children’s Medicine (1991-1992), and Georgian Dance Empire (1993), he performed throughout Georgia as well as abroad, particularly in Moscow and Eastern Europe. Charkviani’s debut solo-album Svan Song was recorded in Germany in 1993 and proved to be a significant influence on the Georgian alternative music of the 1990s. He composed music for the feature film "Orpheus’s Death" in 1995 and went on to record his second album Ap’ren in 1997, followed by the single Sakartvelo in 1999 and the albums Amo and Savse in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Around the same period, he chose the pseudonym of Mefe, meaning in Georgian "the king". Charkviani also authored several poems, stories and a novel, but his music remained the principal source of his popularity.
Charkviani was found dead, reportedly of "heart problems",Georgian Poet Dies Of Alleged Heart Problems. Prime News Online, February 25, 2006. at his apartment in Tbilisi on February 24, 2006, leaving several unpublished songs which were subsequently released as the album Dzirs Mefe ("Down with the King") in 2007.
In May 2013 Irakli Charkviani was posthumously awarded Georgia's most prestigious Rustaveli Prize for "his significant contribution to the development of contemporary Georgian culture".http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqdBYDigoxA

Despite having left no published works, and not being part of the close-knit collectors of the Royal Society, Dandridge is credited by numerous entomologists of his time with having provided invaluable assistance and access to his extensive collections of specimens, and even near the end of his life remaining 'affable and communicative'.http://books.google.co.za/books?id=HKr7B1AIW0oC&pg=PA514&lpg=PA514&dq=%22Joseph+Dandridge%22+silk&source=web&ots=EvpqO7VKrw&sig=yO5Ts19QJPFRmkposjdJ-z3T8oc&hl=en#PPA514,M1 The collections spanned, besides insects and arachnids, shells, fossils, birds' eggs and skins, flowering plants, lichens, mosses and fungi. A volume of 119 water-colours by Dandridge dating from before 1710 of the arachnids, accompanied by meticulous notes, is in the Sloane Collection of the British Museum and is designated Sloane MS 3999. W. S. Bristowe discovered that this work had been used without acknowledgement by Eleazar Albin in his Natural History of Spiders and other Curious Insects of 1736.* Review: Spider-Man at Work : David E.

Large numbers of Huguenot silk weavers moved to the Spitalfields area at the end of the 17th century. One of the most noted silk producers was James Leman (1688-1745), who was both designer and manufacturer and made use of other designers such as Christopher Baudouin and Joseph Dandridge.Spitalfields Market, Old Spitalfields Market, London E1, fashion market Spitalfields, London UK A number of Dandridge's silk designs dating from 1717 to 1722 have found their way to the Victoria & Albert Museum and may be seen in the Prints & Drawings Study Room.Leman Album - Victoria and Albert Museum
Dandridge lived at Moorfields near Bedlam, close to his friend James Petiver, and for a while at Stoke Newington, which at that time was in the country. He became acquainted with the leading workers in the fields of his interests, such as John Ray, Adam Buddle, Benjamin Wilkes, Eleanor GlanvilleEleanor Glanville and William Sherard, and instructed Eleazar Albin,Lot 141: ELEAZAR ALBIN (fl. 1713-1759) - Featured on Artfact.com the watercolourist, in natural history.http://books.google.co.za/books?id=v5PYJz2SASQC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22Joseph+Dandridge%22+naturalist&source=web&ots=a4brHyv1cO&sig=U4aDZ_1yk6J3syFRPOrfCleM020&hl=en

Jacques Renouvin (6 October 1905 – 24 January 1944) was a royalist militant in France during the Second World War and hero of the French resistance.
Born in Paris, Renouvin studied law and initially became a lawyer. He initially supported Action française, but left after 6 February 1934. In November 1938 after the Munich agreement, he garnered attention by publicly slapping Pierre-Étienne Flandin, who had thought it was a good idea to send a congratulatory telegram to Adolf Hitler. Renouvin was mobilised in 1939, and he was a volunteer for the corps francs. He fought a brilliant campaign, being wounded and taken prisoner. He escaped from the hospital to which he had been brought.
After demobilisation, he moved to the free zone in late 1940, and joined the underground movement Liberté created by a small group of Christian democrat teachers. Specifically responsible for propaganda, he organised youth commandos in pursuit of this. After the merger between Liberté et Les Petites Ailes which gave rise to Combat, Henri Frenay put Renouvin in charge of organising  Groupes francs throughout the free zone. This position made him one of the most wanted resistance members by all the police.
Renouvin was arrested on the 29 January 1943 by the Gestapo at Brive-la-Gaillarde railway station, along with Mireille Tronchon whom he had married while in hiding. He was transferred to Fresnes Prison and tortured for several months before being deported to Germany on the 29 August 1943. Interned in Mauthausen concentration camp, he died of exhaustion on 24 January 1944.
He had a son, Bertrand Renouvin, from his marriage to Mireille Tronchon; Bertrand was born on 15 June 1943 while his mother was still being held in La Santé prison.
A postage stamp of value 20 centimes was issued in 1961 in Renouvin's memory.

Worthy received her bachelors degree from the University of Michigan and her law degree from the University of Notre Dame.  
Worthy started as an assistant prosecutor in Wayne County in 1984.  She served in this position for ten years, trying over 800 cases.  The most notable was the trial of Walter Budzyn and Larry Nevers in the beating death of Malice Green.  Among the cases Worthy had go to trial her conviction rate was over 90%.Detroit's dramatic prosecutor. (Kym Worthy, lawyer in Malice Green police brutality case) - Ebony | Encyclopedia.com From 1994- January 2004 Worthy was a judge on the Wayne County Circuit Court.

Early in her time as county prosecutor Worthy was criticized for giving too many plea deals to people involved in gun crimes.Detroit News, August 16th, 2004[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Worthy has also at times had her prosecutions hampered by the ineptitude of the Detroit Police Crime Lab.http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/shared-gen/ap/National/Gun_Tests_Suspended.html?cxntlid=inform_sr[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
In 2010 she appealed to the decision of providing Jean Paul Orlewicz a new trial. Orlewicz, 18 was convicted of first degree murder, after the Wayne county prosecutor had previously established an agreement with murderer, Alex Letkemann, in order to have a stronger case against Orlewicz.
Presently, Worthy is working on resolving a massive backlog of unprocessed rape test kits in Detroit.  In 2009, one of her assistants discovered a massive number of kits sitting in a warehouse that the Detroit Police Department had used as an overflow storage facility for evidence.  Eventually, over 11,000 rape test kits--some of which had been sitting unprocessed for a decade or more--were discovered in the warehouse.  In one case, a 2002 rape was linked to a man who was incarcerated for three murders he committed in the seven years after the rape.  Worthy took the discovery very personally, in part because she was sexually assaulted herself while at Notre Dame (though it was unreported).Prosecutor leads effort to test long-abandoned rape kits, brings justice to victims.

The 1925 U.S. Open was the 29th U.S. Open, held June 3–5 at Worcester Country Club in Worcester, Massachusetts. Scottish pro Willie Macfarlane won the 36-hole playoff by one stroke on the final hole to secure his only major championship and deny Bobby Jones his second Open, which he won the following year.
Francis Ouimet, the 1913 champion, held the lead after the first round. Macfarlane tied Leo Diegel for the second round lead after a 67 that established a new tournament record. Macfarlane carded a 72 in the third round that gave him a one-stroke lead over Johnny Farrell. Macfarlane, however, struggled in the final round on his way to a 78 and 291 total. That was still good enough to tie Jones, who shot 74 after a 70 in the third round. Farrell and Ouimet (who was playing in his final Open), shot 78 and 76, respectively, to finish a shot out of the playoff.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zG0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0IsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583%2C695452 |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Macfarlane and Jones in tie for U.S. Open honors |date=June 5, 1925 |page=16[/tpl]
The first 18 holes on Friday ended in a tie, with both Macfarlane and Jones shooting 75. Jones took a four-stroke lead after nine during the second playoff round, but Macfarlane managed to tie after recording birdies at 10 and 13, while Jones bogeyed 13. The match was still all square heading to the 18th. Macfarlane found the green on his approach while Jones hit into a bunker. After Jones failed to get up-and-down, Macfarlane two-putted for the title. Macfarlane was the first Scot to win the Open since Alex Smith in 1910.
During the first round, Jones was getting set to hit an iron shot out of the rough on the 11th hole when he felt his club move the ball ever so slightly.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/06/12/us.open.history/index.html |title=Fun and sick facts about U.S. Open |date=June 12, 2008 |first=Ethan |last=Trex |accessdate=March 19, 2012 |work=CNN[/tpl]  No one else seemed to have seen this movement, but Jones called a penalty on himself. After officials were unable to confirm that the ball had actually moved, they allowed Jones to make his own ruling on whether or not he should be penalized. Jones said he was certain the ball had moved and penalized himself. The decision cost him the title, but forever added to Jones's legacy.  Spectators praised him for his sportsmanship, but he would have none of it. He flatly replied, "You might as well praise me for not robbing a bank."  Because there were so many players with a chance on the final nine of regulation and both playoff rounds were drama-filled, William D. Richardson of The New York Times called it "easily the greatest Open Championship of them all."Barrett, David. Golf Courses of the U.S. Open. New York, New York: Abrams, 2007.

The technique was patented by Sam Saunders of Goring-on-Thames and was first used on the 1898 umpire's steam launch of the same name. Having been restored, the steam launch Consuta was returned to service on the River Thames on 15 October 2001.The Consuta Trust
After opening the S. E. Saunders boatyard at East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, the technique was further used to build the crew and engine gondolas for HMA1 Mayfly, Britain's first airship. Later, the same technique was used to construct the hull of the Sopwith Bat Boat, the early flying boat that won the Mortimer Singer prize
The technique remained in use until waterproof glues became available in the 1950s.

[[History of malaria]]

The history of malaria stretches from its prehistoric origin as a zoonotic disease in the primates of Africa through to the twentieth century.

</ref> Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since the discovery of the [[parasite]]s which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology.
The most critical factors in the spread or eradication of disease have been human behavior (shifting population centers, changing farming methods and the like) and living standards. Precise statistics do not exist because many cases occur in rural areas where people do not have access to hospitals or other health care. As a consequence, the majority of cases are undocumented.[tpl]cite journal | author = Murray CJ, Rosenfeld LC, Lim SS, Andrews KG, Foreman KJ, Haring D, Fullman N, Naghavi M, Lozano R, Lopez AD | title = Global malaria mortality between 1980 and 2010: a systematic analysis | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960034-8/fulltext/ | journal = Lancet | year = 2012 | volume = 379 | issue = 9814 | pages = 413-431 | pmid = 22305225 [/tpl] Poverty has been and remains associated with the disease.[tpl]cite journal | author = Worrall E, Basu S, Hanson K | title = Is malaria a disease of poverty?

References to its unique, periodic fevers are found throughout recorded history beginning in 2700 BC in China.
For thousands of years, traditional herbal remedies have been used to treat malaria.[tpl]cite journal | author = Willcox ML, Bodeker G| title = Traditional herbal medicines for malaria | journal = BMJ| year = 2004 | volume = 329| pages = 1156–9| pmid =15539672| doi =10.1136/bmj.329.7475.1156| url = http://www.giftsofhealth.org/ritam/flyer/Willcox&Bodeker2004.pdf | issue = 7475 | pmc = 527695 [/tpl] The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated.  Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs including chloroquine and artemisinins were used to resist the scourge. 
Malaria researchers have won multiple Nobel Prizes for their achievements, although the disease continues to afflict some 200 million patients each year, killing more than 600,000.
Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected.[tpl]Cite book |author=Bray RS |title=Armies of Pestilence: The Effects of Pandemics on History |year=2004|publisher=James Clarke |isbn=978-0-227-17240-7 |page=102 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=djPWGnvBm08C&pg=PA102[/tpl] According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns."[tpl]Cite book |author=Byrne JP |title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A-M |year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-34102-1 |page=383 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA383[/tpl]
At the close of the 20th century, malaria remains endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.

Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man was a short comic strip series published in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man Family, in August 2008. It was written by Tom DeFalco, and illustrated by Ron Frenz and several other artists.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
The series took place in the MC2 universe, and bridges the gap between the final issues of DeFalco's run on The Amazing Spider-Man and his future canon in Spider-Girl, taking place shortly after the renegade clone Kaine rescued an infant Mayday Parker from the clutches of Norman Osborn's agents and returned her safely to her parents Peter and Mary Jane. Peter continues his career as Spider-Man and begins to cope with the additional headaches of raising an infant daughter with his wife.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
According to DeFalco, the events of "The Final Chapter" take place two years after this series. Mayday is six months old when the series begins, and is two when Peter loses his leg in a final battle with the Green Goblin, ending his career as Spider-Man.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
The strip was originally intended to run in the closing issue of the "Spider-Man Family" volume, but was held back to launch within the rebranded title. A podcast interview with DeFalco in November 2008 confirmed that, due to Spider-Girl becoming an integral part of Amazing Spider-Man Family, Mr and Mrs. Spider-Man would become a casualty and will be concluded. Only four storylines were written. The strips were later collected in a trade paperback of The Spectacular Spider-Girl.

Polybius states Agathoclea had relatives who served the Ptolemaic dynasty: Nico or Nicon a nauarch under Ptolemy IV;Polybius 15.25.37, 15.33.7 PhiloPolybius 15.30.5 and Philammon appointed libyarch of Cyrene by her brother.Polybius 15.33.11
Agathoclea may have been an owner of a grain boat.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Agathoclea, Footnote 3 Agathoclea and her brother, who both exercised almost unlimited influence over the Pharaoh, were introduced to him by their ambitious mother. Polybius (15.31.13), states that Agathoclea claimed to have a wet-nurse to the son of Ptolemy IV. Despite Ptolemy IV marrying his sister Arsinoe III in 220 BC, Agathoclea continued to be his favourite. In late c. 210 BC, Agathoclea may have given birth to a son from her affair with Ptolemy IV, who may have died shortly after his birth.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Possible child of Ptolemy IV
On the death of Ptolemy IV in 205 BC, Agathoclea and her friends kept the event secret, that they might have an opportunity of plundering the royal treasury. They also formed a conspiracy with Sosibius aimed at placing Agathocles on the throne or at least making him regent for the new boy king, Ptolemy V Epiphanes. With the support of Sosibius, they murdered Arsinoe III. Agathocles then acted as guardian to the young king Ptolemy V. 
In 203/202 BC, the Egyptians and Greeks of Alexandria, exasperated at Agathocles' outrages, rose against him, and the military governor Tlepolemus placed himself at their head. They surrounded the palace in the night, and forced their way in. Agathocles and his sister begged for mercy, but in vain. Agathocles was killed by his friends, to avoid an even more cruel fate. Agathoclea with her sisters, and Oenanthe, who had taken refuge in a temple, were dragged out, and in a state of nakedness exposed to the fury of the multitude, who literally tore them limb from limb. All their relations and those who had had any share in the murder of Arsinoe III were likewise put to death.Polybius v. 63, xiv. 11, xv. 25—34Justin, xxx. 1, 2Athenaeus, vi. p. 251, xiii. p. 576Plutarch, Cleom. 33
There was another Agathoclea, the daughter of a man named Aristomenes, who was by birth an Acarnanian, and rose to great power in Egypt.Polybius l.c.

[[Steel Guitar Rag]]

CATEGORIES: Western swing songs, 1936 songs

"Steel Guitar Rag" is the seminal Western swing instrumental credited with popularizing the steel guitar as an integral instrument in a Western band.Townsend, San Antonio Rose,p. 99: There are authorities, McAuliffe among them, who believe this recording Guitar Rag", March 25, 1935 and the subsequent use of the instrument in Wills's organization played the leading role in making the steel guitar popular in American music."Harrington,Sonic Cool, p. 22: "In September '36, Leon McAuliffe had a huge hit with 'Steel Guitar Rag,' which helped popularize the sound of the electric guitar to the whole nation."Lange,Smile When You Call Me a Hillbilly, p. 121: "McAuliffe's guitar eventually became an integral part of Bob Wills sound, particularly after the release of 'Steel Guitar Rag' in the late 1936. McAuliffe turned the instrumental piece, which was derived from a Hawaiian tune, into country music's first steel guitar standard."
Written by Leon McAuliffe, it was first recorded by Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys in 1936.Stambler, Country Music, p. 289: " 'I've McAuliffe written some songs that are good, but not many. I can't manufacture 'em, they have to come to me. I  wrote 'Steel Guitar Rag' and the bridge to 'San Antonio Rose'—the trumpeter wrote the words—but Bob has total credit.' "Oliphant, "Texas Jazz", p. 50-51: "As early as 1933, Leon McAuliffe also was playing steel guitar, and in 1935 he joined Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, recording with the latter his own composition, 'Steel Guitar Rag,' during a session of September 29–30, 1936." The song stylistically bears a striking resemblance to a popular Hawaiian song, "On The Beach At Waikiki" (words, G.H. Stover; music, Henry Kailimai; arrangement, Sonny Cunha; 1915), which was widely performed on the vaudeville circuits in the U.S.Koskoff, Music Cultures in the United States, p. 129: "The debut of the song 'On the Beach at Waikiki' at the Panama-Pacific Exposition 1915 is credited with sparking a national fad for Hawaiian songs."*Ruymar, The Hawaiian Steel Guitar, p. 50, quoting John York, president of the Western Swing Music Society: "When you next listen to a recording of Leon McAuliffe playing Steel Guitar Rag or Pan Handle Rag, listen for the Hawaiian style with a slight difference. Leon's influence came from listening to recordings of Jim and the Genial Hawaiians, and of Sol Ho'opi'i."Santoro, Stir It Up, p. 183: "Hawaiian sounds began to outsell other forms of pop music on the mainland U.S., and had such an impact that Mexican bands added steel guitar players and masqueraded as Hawaiians to crash the lucrative U.S. vaudeville circuit." McAuliffe's composition is likely adapted from "Guitar Rag" recorded by guitarist Sylvester Weaver in the early 1920s.Dempsey, The Light Crust Doughboys Are on the Air, pp. 57-58: "Dough Boy Kenneth Pitts admired McAuliffe's tune, 'Steel Guitar Rag,' which McAuliffe adapted from a tune called 'Guitar Rag' by blues guitarist Sylvester Weaver."Komara, Encyclopedia of the Blues, p. 385: "The latter Rag' is a blues guitar landmark, having been appropriated countless times including as 'Steel Guitar Rag' by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys in 1936." Many musicians and bands have recorded this instrumental over the years. A recent version was performed by Country Music Hall of Famer Jimmy Russell.

CATEGORIES: Video game development software

The Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Creation Engine, abbreviated as OHRRPGCE or OHR, is an open-source, "All-in-one" game creation system. It was designed to allow the quick creation of 2D role-playing video games. It was originally written by James Paige in QuickBASIC and released in 1997, and a community of hobbyist game developers have created thousands of amateur games since that time. In May 2005, the source code was released as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), and it was later ported from QuickBASIC to FreeBASIC. The community is spread across two sites: CastleParadox and SlimeSalad, the latter being open to all game engines.
The OHRRPGCE is very simple to use, and full RPGs can be made without any scripting. HamsterSpeak, the scripting language used for the OHR, is extremely simple and can be picked up with no prior programming knowledge. As it is very high-level and specialized, many things can be done with it. HUDs, battle systems, special effects, customized menus, and entirely scripted games are some of the possibilities.

[[Nicholas Ludford]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance composers, English composers, People of the Tudor period, 1480s births, 1557 deaths, 15th-century English people, 16th-century English people

Nicholas Ludford (c. 1485 – c. 1557) was an English composer of the Tudor period. He is known for his festal masses, which are preserved in two early-16th-century choirbooks, the Caius Choirbook at Caius College, Cambridge, and the Lambeth Choirbook at Lambeth Palace, London, along with those of the older composer Robert Fayrfax (1462–1521), with whom his music is often associated. Ludford's composing career, which appears to have ended in 1535, is seen as bridging the gap between the music of Fayrfax and that of John Taverner (1495–1545).Skinner, 1993. Music scholar David Skinner has called Ludford "one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony".Skinner, 1993. In his Oxford History of English Music, John Caldwell observes of Ludford's six-part Mass and Magnificat Benedicta that it "is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times".Caldwell, p. 219.
Ludford's early career is undocumented, but his date of birth has been estimated at around 1485 on the basis of his acceptance into the Fraternity of St Nicholas, a guild of parish clerks in London, in 1521. He does not seem to have taken a university degree. Sometime after 1500, Ludford became established as a singer at St Stephen's College, Westminster, adjacent to Westminster Palace. When Henry VIII shut the college down in 1547 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Ludford was listed as a verger. He was given a pension, which he last drew in 1556, suggesting that he died in 1557.Skinner, 1993.

The Battle of Tacna, also known as the Battle of Alliance Heights (Spanish: Batalla del Alto de la Alianza), effectively destroyed the Peru-Bolivian alliance against Chile, forged by a secret treaty signed in 1873. On May 26, 1880, the Chilean northern operations army led by General Manuel Baquedano González, conclusively defeated a Peru-Bolivian army commanded by Bolivian President, General Narciso Campero, after almost five hours of fierce combat. This battle took place at the Intiorko hill plateau, a few miles north of the Peruvian city of Tacna. As a result, the Bolivian army returned to its country, and never participated in the conflict again, leaving Peru to fight the rest of the war alone. Also, this victory consolidated the Chilean domain over the Tarapacá Province, territory definitively annexed to Chile after the signing of the Tratado de Ancón (English: Treaty of Ancon), in 1884, which ended the war. Tacna itself remained under Chilean control until 1929.

The 1956–57 NBA season was the franchise's 11th season in the NBA. Prior to the start of the season, the Hawks made one of the biggest draft day deals in NBA history. The Hawks sent 2nd overall pick Bill Russell to the Boston Celtics for Cliff Hagan and 2nd year star Ed Macauley.http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/stlhawks/stlhawks.html
Macauley had been a popular player at St. Louis University.  The Hawks struggled most of the season and coach Red Holzman was fired midway through the season.
The new head coach was Slater Martin, who led the Hawks to a 5–3 record.
Martin did not want the added responsibility of head coach, so Alex Hannum took over the rest of the season. Despite a 34–38 record, the Hawks would claim the Western Division by a tiebreaker and earned a bye into the Western Finals. In the Western Finals, the Hawks would sweep the Minneapolis Lakers in 3 straight games. The Hawks would meet the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals.
The Hawks would win Game 1 in double overtime 125–123 in Boston.
The Celtics took Game 2 and the Hawks took Game 3 at home by 2 points. After losing Game 5 in Boston, the Hawks needed another victory at home to force a decisive 7th game. Game 7 in Boston would go into double overtime but the Celtics would emerge victorious winning by 2 points.

CATEGORIES: 2002 films, Directorial debut films, American documentary films, Documentary films about children, Films shot in New York, Utica, New York

Standing By Yourself is a 2002 documentary that marked the directing debut of filmmaker Josh Koury.  Set in Clinton, New York, a suburb of Utica, the film follows Koury’s maladjusted teenage younger brother and his rambunctious best friend Josh, who share social and economic frustrations of living in a small working-class neighborhood.  They express their pent-up energy and anger through pranks, loitering and mild acts of rebellion, but their friendship is ruptured when Josh’s behavior spirals out of control and he gets in trouble with the law.  By the film’s end, the once-inseparable friends barely know each other as they move into different social spheres.OffOffOff.com review
Koury began Standing By Yourself as a 20-minute senior project at Pratt Institute.  The film was expanded to 57 minutes for presentation at the 2002 Slamdance Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.Amazing World of Cult Movies review  The total budget for the finished film was reportedly U.S.$1,000 ReelTalk Reviews coverage http://www.reeltalkreviews.com/browse/viewitem.asp?type=review&id=513.
Standing By Yourself had its theatrical debut in New York in May 2002, where it received strong reviews for its harsh glimpse of alienated and seemingly self-destructive youth. Dave Kehr of the New York Times praised it as “quietly devastating” while Scott Foundas of Variety stated that Koury’s work “has its finger on something particularly potent” Reviews links for "Standing By Yourself" and Donald J. Levit of ReelTalk Reviews stated “Koury's unsparing art mirrors life, and one must shudder for the future.” ReelTalk Reviews coverage
Standing By Yourself played on the festival circuit in 2002, but did not have additional theatrical engagements.  To date, the film has not been released on DVD.  Koury went on to co-found the Brooklyn Underground Film Festival, and returned to filmmaking in 2008 with the documentary We Are Wizards.IndieWire

[[Transfer cars]]

CATEGORIES: Production and manufacturing

Transfer cars (or transfer carts) are used to move heavy material across floors, typically in factories. There are two types: non-steerable and steerable.   Non-steerable transfer cars, which came first, are typically rail mounted, handle higher capacities up to 100 Tons, and are used to transfer material between crane bays, thus avoiding side loading of hoists.  Steerable transfer cars have wheels and can be directed anywhere in a production area. Non-steerable types run off either AC power or DC (internal battery) power. Steerable types run off an internal battery.  
Transfer cars are currently being used in lean manufacturing of large farm equipment and off-road vehicles and equipment. Typically the partially completed equipment is moved from one production cell to the next everyday or two, instead leaving the equipment stationary and moving the workers and their tools. An assembly line such as this can be made up of 14 transfer cars in session, and used in assembly operations until the wheels of the vehicle are put on. Assembly operations not currently employing this method of production waste 2 to 3 hours per vehicle in material handling the partially completed vehicle from one production cell to the next. They also increase the risk of damaging the vehicle on the assembly path through the plant. Those assembly operations would employ either a series of jib cranes or overhead cranes with slings, and/or spreader beams to move the partially assembled vehicles from one cell to another.  Transfer car normally come in a standard configuration from 5 ton up to 55 ton capacity or in a custom configuration up to 75 ton Capacity. Large capacity is typically required to be an on-rail configuration because of the weight limit of most factory concrete floors.
Transfer caris a kind of handling car which is mounted on the rail. In the modern factory, the transfer car is widely used for transfer raw materials or equipment among the different bays or warehouses in the factory. Transfer cars can be divided into the following types according to the supply power mode:motorless transfer car. In order to save the production cost, many lines such as machinery, shipbuilding, heavy industry, metallurgy begin to adopt this new transfer tool in the factory.
Motorized transfer car power supply mode include: low voltage rails offer the power, acculator offers the power, cable reel offer the power. The low voltage rail transfer car work principle: AC 380V is transformed into AC 36V by way of transformer into rails, and then sent to the current rectifier on the truck, which supply 36V direct current to DC motor. Acculator power transfer car work principle: there is an acculator on the car which offers the DC power for transfer car. The type transfer car is convenient and safe. Cable reel power transfer car work principle: It is equipped with cable reel which operates in hysteresis coupling way to insure cable safe pulling and winding in and to prevent it injured. 380 V power supply to YZ motor, VFD speed adjustment, largest transporting distance 200 meter. 
motorless transfer caris non-power transfer car running on the rail, it can be towed or manual power. The car can meet some special demand. It is convenient and utility.

[[Crisis of Leadership]]

CATEGORIES: Trotskyism

Crisis of Leadership is a term used by Trotskyists to describe the fundamental problem holding back the working class from political power in the epoch of imperialism. Trotsky argued that only Stalinists, centrists and reformists who hold the leadership of the class and its vanguard hold back the working class from political power when capitalism has reached the point that it is ready for socialism.
This is shown in a quote from The Death Agony of Capitalism:
''All talk to the effect that historical conditions have not yet “ripened” for socialism is the product of ignorance or conscious deception. The objective prerequisites for the proletarian revolution have not only “ripened”; they have begun to get somewhat rotten. Without a socialist revolution, in the next historical period at that, a catastrophe threatens the whole culture of mankind. The turn is now to the proletariat, i.e., chiefly to its revolutionary vanguard. The historical crisis of mankind is reduced to the crisis of the revolutionary leadership.
- Leon Trotsky, The Transitional Programme (The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International).1938.''
The importance of this today is the different positions held by Trotskyists groups on this question - indicating their views on programme and epoch.

[[Violin plot]]

CATEGORIES: Statistical charts and diagrams

Violin plots are a method of plotting numeric data. A violin plot is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density plot. Specifically, it starts with a box plot. It then adds a rotated kernel density plot to each side of the box plot.VIOLIN PLOT. www.itl.nist.gov. Retrieved 14 October 2008. 
The violin plot is similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values (in the simplest case this could be a histogram). Typically violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots.  Overlaid on this box plot is a kernel density estimation. 
Violin plots are available as extensions to a number of software packages, including R through the vioplot, wvioplot, caroline, UsingR, lattice, and ggplot2 libraries, and Stata through the vioplot add-in.Hintze, Jerry L., and Ray D.

The 2008–09 season was Tottenham Hotspur 17th season in the Premier League, their 30th successive season in the top division of the English football league system and the 126th year of their history.
After finishing 11th in the 2007–08 season, Tottenham began the season under the leadership of Spaniard Juande Ramos, drafted in to replace Martin Jol mid-way through the previous season. However, after suffering the worst start of a league season in Tottenham's history, with no wins in eight league games and only two points, Ramos was sacked and replaced by seasoned manager Harry Redknapp, who quickly eliminated the continental structure that the club had established over the past seasons. Tottenham's league form improved and mainly remained positive with the final position of eighth a far cry from the relegation places Tottenham had occupied throughout the campaign. Spurs also reached the final of the League Cup, and, as the reigning champions, faced league leaders Manchester United but lost 4–1 on penalties. With an average attendance of 35,929, Tottenham had the ninth highest attendance in the Premier League.
Tottenham drafted in a total of 15 players through transfers and sold 19 players during the combined summer and winter transfer windows.

[[Bogus pipeline]]
CATEGORIES: Social psychology

The bogus pipeline is a technique used by social psychologists to reduce false answers when attempting to collect self-report data. For example, social desirability is a common reason for warped survey results.
The bogus pipeline was first used in the spring of 1967 by psychology professor Harold Sigall at the University of Rochester. He wanted to know if prejudices of white people towards black people had really declined, as surveys reported, or if they were secretly still in force. Today, the bogus pipeline is still used when trying to measure an individual's affect or attitudes toward certain stimuli.
In this technique, the person whose attitude or emotion is being measured is told that they are being monitored by a machine or a polygraph (lie detector), resulting in more truthful answers. The electrodes and wires that are connected to this individual are actually fake. However, participants end up telling their true feelings and attitudes because they believe they are being monitored and that the real answers will surface regardless of their response. In short, the bogus pipeline is a fake polygraph used to get participants to truthfully respond to emotional/affective questions (Kassin, Fein, and Markus, 2008). The bogus pipeline can be used to reduce bias because most people do not want to be “second-guessed” by a machine; it is assumed that people would be motivated to choose the “correct” answer so as not to show an incongruence in attitude (Jones and Sigall, 1971).

The Battle of Coffrane took place on February 28, 1296, about 1 km to the east of Coffrane in the canton of Neuchâtel. The Lords of Valangin with support from the Bishop of Basel rebelled against the Count of Neuchâtel.[tpl]HDS|2859|Coffrane[/tpl] The battle was fought in the Val-de-Ruz, next to the village of Coffrane.

According to legend, after the battle the rebellious lords were brought to Rollin, who informed them that he had sworn that only two heads from them would pay for the revolt.  When the rebels offered up their treasure instead, Rollin allowed them to cast two silver heads which he took instead of executing them.  The silver heads were stored in the collegiate church of Neuchâtel until the Protestant Reformation when they were melted down by the iconoclasts.[tpl]cite book|last=Guerber|first=Hélène Adeline|title=Legends of Switzerland|year=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead & Co|pages=79-81|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k_8YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]

Maryse Marpsat (born 1951) is a French sociologist and statistician whose work employs methods drawn from sociology and statistics but also mathematics. Her major sociological works concern poverty, inequality and homeless situation. She is a civil servant, administrator of the French National Institute of Statistics (INSEE) and a fellow of the CSU, a French research institute specializing in sociological studies in urban societies.
Between 1983 and 1993, as a fellow of two French-British groups, the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure and the Centre for Economic Policy Research in Cambridge, she worked to develop the comparisons of the household ways of living in France and England, particularly with Richard Wall and Bruce Penhale, from the City University of London.Cf. the preparation of the international colloquium Beyond national statistics : household and family patterns in comparative perspective, London in April 1989, see its acts in Insee-Méthodes, n° 8, février 1991
Since 2007, Maryse Marpsat is giving some courses on the topics of her researches. She focuses her last teaching, first, on relationships between statistic tools and their outcomes, and second, on "unequalities", their range, their origins and the different ways of their evaluation.Cf. the web site teachings of EHESS Moreover, since 2007, she has provided on a monthly base some research workshops in her Institute of statistics, for example in 2012 going threw the feeling of inequalities either for owners of the French minimum wage called "RSA" or for retired people.See the list of her seminars in the INSEE.

[[NDPCP]]

CATEGORIES: Nucleotides

5'-guanosyl-methylene-triphosphate (GDPCP) and 5'-adenosyl-methylene-triphosphate (ADPCP) are analogues of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), which store chemical energy from metabolism in the cell. Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) such as ATP and GTP yields energy, inorganic phosphate (Pi or PPi), and either NDP or NMP. GDPCP and ADPCP are not subject to hydrolysis under the same conditions as NTPs; it is this property which makes them useful in experiments in biochemistry and molecular biology.
NTPs can be hydrolyzed at the phosphodiester bonds between phosphates, releasing energy and one or more of the three phosphate groups. Additionally, NTPs are inextricable components of some proteins, where their role may be structural and need not involve hydrolysis. In some cases, the presence of an NTP may be required for association of one protein with another, while hydrolysis is necessary for dissociation. GDPCP and ADPCP could be used in such a case, since association can still occur, but hydrolysis-dependent dissociation cannot.
GDPCP was used to examine the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-Tu. EF-Tu is required for the elongation phase of protein synthesis (translation (biology)). EF-Tu requires GTP in order for the ribosome to bind it, necessary for recruiting an aminoacyl-tRNA. The later dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome, however, requires that the GTP first be hydrolyzed to GDP and Pi. GDPCP was used in place of GTP to differentiate between these two steps: the elongation factor could associate, but without hydrolysis, it was effectively stuck.

HIV and AIDS affects economic growth by reducing the availability of human capital. Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine that is available in developing countries, large numbers of people are falling victim to AIDS. 
People living with HIV/AIDS will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. The forecast is that this will probably cause a collapse of economies and societies in countries with a significant AIDS population. In some heavily infected areas, the epidemic has left behind many orphans cared for by elderly grandparents.[ref]
</ref>
The increased mortality in this region will result in a smaller skilled population and labor force. This smaller labor force will be predominantly young people, with reduced knowledge and work experience leading to reduced productivity. An increase in workers’ time off to look after sick family members or for sick leave will also lower productivity. Increased mortality will also weaken the mechanisms that generate human capital and investment in people, through loss of income and the death of parents. As the epidemic progresses, the age profile of those infected will increase, though the peak is expected to stay within the working age population. HIV disproportionately infects and impacts on women, so those sectors employing large numbers of women e.g. education, may be disproportionately economically impacted by HIVRisley CL, Drake LJ, Bundy DAP (2012) Economic Impact of HIV and Antiretroviral Therapy on Education Supply in High Prevalence Regions.

Nathaniel Pendleton (October 27, 1756  - October 20, 1821) was a lawyer and judge in the United States at the time of the American Revolutionary War and afterward.
Born in New Kent County, Virginia, Pendleton, whose uncle was Edmund Pendleton, read law to become a lawyer. He was a soldier in the Continental Army during the American Revolution, and later entered private practice in Savannah, Georgia until 1789. He was also the Attorney General of Georgia in 1785-1786. Pendleton was elected to both the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, and the Confederation Congress in 1789, but attended neither.The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United StatesBiographical Directory of the United States Congress
He was nominated by President George Washington on September 24, 1789, to a new seat created by 1 Stat. 73, as Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Georgia. Pendleton was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 26, 1789, and received his commission that day. He resigned on September 1, 1796, and returned to private practice in Dutchess County, New York. At some point thereafter, he became a county judge for Dutchess County, and held that position until his death in Hyde Park, New York. In 1804, he served as a "second" to Alexander Hamilton in Hamilton’s duel with Aaron Burr.
Congressman Nathanael Greene Pendleton was Pendleton's son.A Guide to the Pendleton Family Papers, 1775-1881

Its leaves are also un-lobed unlike Field scabious,Usborne Spotter's Handbook of Birds, Trees, Wildflowers and are arranged in opposite pairs. The leaves and plant can be confused with Greater Knapweed however Knapweed has leaves that are alternate, not opposite.
It prefers moist soil—damp meadows and woods, lowland heath, marshy areas; but will tolerate drier conditions.  Male and female flowers are produced on different heads, the female being smaller.A photographic guide to Wildflowers of Britain and Europe by Paul Sterry and Bob Press Flowers from June until October.

The Glasscock County Courthouse is an historic courthouse building located  in Garden City, Glasscock County, Texas. Built in 1909 to 1910 at a cost of $28,000, it was designed by Georgia-born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who is noted for the  courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida, Georgia and Texas. It was built of granite and rusticated stone with gable front porticoes on all sides, each of which is supported by four 2-story Doric columns. Unlike the Mason County Courthouse also designed by Hosford  and built at the same time for $39,786, the Glasscock County Courthouse has no clock tower cupola in the center of its roof and its side porticoes are smaller than the other two.

[[Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrocharitaceae, Plants described in 1753

Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, frogbit, is a flowering plant belonging to the genus Hydrocharis in the family Hydrocharitaceae. In North America, it is referred to as common frogbit or European frog's-bitDickinson, T.; Metsger, D.; Bull, J.; & Dickinson, R. (2004) ROM Field Guide to Wildflowers of Ontario. Toronto:Royal Ontario Museum, p. 67. to distinguish it from the related American Frogbit (Limnobium spongia).
It is a small floating plant resembling a small water lily. It bears small, three-petalled white flowers. The floating leaves are kidney-shaped and grow in rosettes on the water surface, with the roots hanging down into the water column but not normally touching bottom. Frogbit is fast growing and spreads rapidly by stolons, surviving the winter as dormant turions which rest on the bottom, rising again to the surface in spring.
Frogbit is native to Europe and parts of Asia, but it was introduced to Canada in the 1930s and has become invasive in eastern Canada and the northeastern USA, particularly around the Great Lakes. It is considered a pest in this region as it colonises waterways and forms dense masses of vegetation on the surface, threatening native biodiversity, although in its native areas it is rarely dominant.European Frogbit: Should we be Worried?[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012[/tpl]

[[Socialist Party of Oklahoma]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of Oklahoma, Socialist Party of America, Socialism in the United States, Socialist parties in the United States, State and local socialist parties in the United States

The Socialist Party of Oklahoma was a semi-autonomous affiliate of the Socialist Party of America located in the Southwestern state of Oklahoma. One of the last states admitted to the United States of America, the area later incorporated into Oklahoma had been previously used for reservations to which indigenous Native American populations were deported, with the area formally divided after 1890 into two entities — an "Oklahoma Territory" in the West and an "Indian Territory" in the East.
In April 1889 some 2 million acres of unassigned lands in the future Oklahoma Territory were opened up to non-Native American settlement in the first of a series of Oklahoma land runs. Dominated by agriculture in an often harsh climate, the Oklahoma Territory was in this period one of the last undeveloped frontiers of the continental United States. With the regional economy dominated by the massive economic power of great railroads and large financial entities, an ethic of agrarian radicalism developed among many of Oklahoma's debt-ridden and impoverished small-holding farmers. Powered more by religious fervor than by Marxist ideology, substantial sections of the People's Party and its eventual successor, the Socialist Party sprung forth from the Oklahoma soil.
As the first decade of the 20th Century drew to a close, the Socialist Party of Oklahoma was one of the most dominant state organizations of the national party, gaining the support of nearly one in five Oklahoma voters and electing candidates to office in various locales around the state. 
This boom was followed by a bust, however. The anti-militarist stance taken by the Socialist Party towards World War I was deeply unpopular with many of the organization's generally patriotic rural party members and provoked disruptive and sometimes violent reactions by others in the community. In August 1917 a failed armed march on Washington, DC remembered to history as the Green Corn Rebellion, organized by a local radical organization close to the Industrial Workers of the World, was blamed on the Socialists. The massive public outrage which followed prompted the dismantling of the state organization. By 1920 organized Socialism in Oklahoma had been fairly completely extinguished.
A fledgling Oklahoma state socialist organization was reestablished in 1928 and grew somewhat during the first half of the 1930s during the years of the Great Depression.

Sewickley High School was a public school in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. The school's roots can be traced back to 1834, when it was located in an old log church. In 1894, a new building for the school was built, known as the Richardson Romanesque Sewickley Public School, often affectionately called the "yellow brick" school. This served as Sewickley High School's location until 1926, when the school was moved to a new location on Harbaugh street, and was renamed Sewickley High School. The old "yellow brick" building became Sewickley Elementary School, until it was razed in 1975. Sewickley High School became a popular rival of Leetsdale High School. The school closed in 1956 when the Quaker Valley School District was formed, and the building was converted to a junior high school, known as Quaker Valley Junior High. It was then changed to Quaker Valley Middle School in 1997. Since its closing, the building has undergone significant remodeling and has had two major additions. The "Sewickley High School" name still remains on the front entrance of the school.

Ciril Kotnik (20 December 1895 - 29 June 1948) was a Yugoslav diplomat of Slovene ethnicity.
He was born in Ljubljana, then part the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Carinthian Slovene parents. He attended the Ljubljana Classical Gymnasium, where he became a member of the radical student association Preporod ("Rebirth"), which advocated the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the creation of a common state for all South Slavic peoples. At the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912, Kotnik volunteered in the Serbian army. After the war, he was awarded the Karadjordje's star, one of the highest military awards in the Kingdom of Serbia.
After the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, Kotnik was included in the diplomatic service of the new state. He was sent to Rome, where he worked at the Yugoslav embassy to the Kingdom of Italy. He lived and worked in Rome for more than two decades and married a local woman, Maria Tommassetti.
After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Yugoslav embassy was closed down and its personnel dismissed. Kotnik was put into house arrest in his home in Rome. At the end of 1941, the Royal Yugoslav Government-in-Exile decided to include Kotnik in the Yugoslav diplomatic delegation to the Holy See. He maintained close contacts with the Yugoslav government in London, the monarchist resistance movement of general Draža Mihajlović, but was hostile to the Communist-led Yugoslav partisans of Josip Broz Tito.
After the Italian armistice in September 1943, Kotnik took advantage of his position of ambassador to the Holy See in order to help many anti-fascists and Jews to escape Nazi German persecution. During this time, he established contacts with the political activist Janko Kralj, and Slovene emigrant from Gorizia, who also helped many anti-Nazis and Jews to escape persecution. On October 28, 1943, the Nazis arrested Kotnik and jailed him in the prison on Via Tasso. He was submitted to heavy torture, but did not reveal his sources.
After the war, he collaborated with the Slovene political emigrants Miha Krek and Ivan Ahčin in helping Slovene refugees fleeing from Socialist Yugoslavia. Kotnik died in 1948 because of the lesions suffered under torture. In 2007, members of the Jewish community of Rome proposed to erect a monument in his memory.
Ciril Kotnik was the cousin of the Slovene philologian and literary historian Franc Kotnik and of the linguist Janko Kotnik. His half-brother is the missionary Jaroslav Kotnik from Trieste. He had three daughters, including the Italian Canadian journalist Dara Kotnik Mancini and Ivanka Kotnik, mother of the Italian politician Walter Veltroni, former Mayor of Rome and former president of the Democratic Party.

The 1958–59 Chicago Black Hawks season was the team's thirty-third season in the NHL, and the club was coming off of a fifth place finish in 1957–58, as they finished the year 24–39–7, earning 55 points, which was their highest point total since last making the playoffs in 1952–53.
It was a quiet off-season for the Black Hawks, who made no major moves.  The team named Ed Litzenberger the new team captain, as the spot was left vacant for the 1957–58 season.
Chicago would get off to a good start, going unbeaten in their first four games, before going on a six game winless streak to drop them under .500.  The Black Hawks would hover around the .500 mark all season long, and as a result, the team set a club record with 28 victories, and tied the club record by earning 69 points, as the Black Hawks qualified for the post-season for the first time since 1952–53.  Chicago finished in third place, which was their highest finish in the standings since finishing third in the 1945–46 season.
Offensively, Chicago was led by Ed Litzenberger, who led the club with 33 goals and 77 points.  His 77 points tied a club record originally set by Max Bentley in 1943–44.  Tod Sloan finished with 27 goals and 62 points, while Ted Lindsay rebounded from a poor 1957–58 season by scoring 22 goals and 58 points, while leading the NHL with 181 penalty minutes.  Bobby Hull had a solid season, scoring 18 goals and 50 points.  On the blueline, Pierre Pilote led the way, scoring 7 goals and 37 points, while Moose Vasko chipped in with 6 goals and 10 assists for 16 points.
In goal, Glenn Hall had all the playing time for the second straight season, as he won a club record 28 games and posted a 2.97 GAA, along with a shutout.
Chicago would face the Montreal Canadiens in the best of seven NHL semi-final.  The Canadiens finished the year on top of the NHL standings with 91 points, and had won the Stanley Cup three years in a row.  The series opened at the Montreal Forum, and the Canadiens took control of the series, winning the opening two games by scores of 4–2 and 5–1 to take the 2–0 series lead.  The series moved to Chicago Stadium for the next two games, and the Black Hawks responded, winning their first playoff games since 1953, as they defeated Montreal 4–2 and 3–2 to even the series up at two games a piece.  The series returned to Montreal for the fifth game, and the heavily favored Canadiens put the Black Hawks on the brink of elimination with a 4–2 win to take a 3–2 series lead.  Montreal ended the series in the sixth game in Chicago, hanging on for a 5–4 victory to win the series.

Although the Isles of Scilly are still part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall, and some services have been combined with those of Cornwall, since 1890 the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly. The adjective "Scillonian" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The Duchy of Cornwall owns most of the freehold land on the islands.

The Hispano HA-100 Triana (named for the district of Seville where the Hispano Aviación plant was located) was a military trainer aircraft developed in Spain in the 1950s. The first aircraft designed by Willy Messerschmitt after World War II, it was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tricycle undercarriage. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem.
The programme was initiated when the Spanish government issued a requirement in 1951 for a replacement for the Hispano HS-42s and HA-43s then in service. Hispano proposed two versions with different engine power, the HA-100E and HA-100F, the former for basic training, the latter for advanced training, and the construction of two prototypes of each was undertaken. Development was fraught with problems, mostly in obtaining suitable parts, and most particularly with engines. The ENMASA Sirio was originally selected for the HA-100E, but when this proved unavailable, the ENMASA Beta was used instead, a heavier and  much more powerful engine than had been wanted for the basic trainer. As it transpired, the performance of this engine was far from satisfactory, and when the second prototype flew in February 1955 (the first HA-100F), it was powered by a Wright R-1300.
Flight testing was very positive, and the HA-100 performed well in comparative tests against the American T-28 Trojan, leading to a contract for 40 of the aircraft. However, obtaining engines remained a stumbling block, with Spain unable to afford to import the Wright engine in quantity. Eventually, production ground to a halt, and the decision was taken to scrap the airframes under construction, salvaging only the wings and empennages for use on the HA-200 project.

[[Decline of the English Murder]]

CATEGORIES: Essays by George Orwell, 1946 essays, Works originally published in Tribune (magazine), Essays in literary criticism, 1965 books

"Decline of the English Murder" is an essay by George Orwell, wherein he analysed the kinds of murders depicted in popular media and why people like to read them. Tribune published it on 15 February 1946, and Secker and Warburg republished it after his death in Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1952.
Orwell identified several common features which 'have given the greatest amount of pleasure to the British public' during 'our great period in murder, between roughly 1850 and 1925' and may be considered from a News of the World reader's point of view, the "perfect" murder: middle class criminals, sex or respectability as a motif, mostly poisoning, deaths slow to be seen as due to crime, a dramatic coincidence or unbelievable occurrence, the aim of getting hold of a certain known sum of money - usually small, and domestic victims against an essentially domestic background.
Orwell excluded Jack the Ripper's murder spree as being "in a class by itself" and considered the cases of Dr. Palmer of Rugeley, Neill Cream, Mrs. Maybrick, Dr. Crippen, Frederick Seddon, Joseph Smith, Armstrong, Bywaters and Thompson, and an unnamed case from 1919, wherein the accused was acquitted.Under British Law it would open him to a charge of libel had he named him.
Orwell then contrasted these with the Cleft Chin Murder, a recent murder during World War II, distinguished by its brutal casualness rather than by emotion or class. He suggested that this story became a distraction amid the doodle-bugs and created excitement because the man was sentenced to death and the girl to imprisonment. According to Orwell, a call for the girl also to be hanged flowed from the brutalizing effects of the war,  and he thought that the story would not be as remembered as the older cases.
The essay was later collected in a compilation entitled Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by London's Penguin Group in 1965.
The essay's opening sentence pictures a typical working Englishman settling down with the News of the World after his Sunday lunch. The final issue of this newspaper in July 2011 quoted this sentence, claiming that Orwell had well-described the sentiments of the nation. However, media pundit Max Atkinson argued that Orwell was in fact satirizing the sensationalist tabloids.[tpl]cite news|last=de Castella|first=Tom|title=Was George Orwell a fan of the News of the World?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14106031|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=BBC News Magazine|date=11 July 2011[/tpl]
His essay "Raffles and Miss Blandish" also casts a light on how he thought an English murder was in a different class from any other murder and compares a 'partly Americanised' sensibility to former times.

Previously, Machineries of Joy Vol. 3, a compilation from industrial/EBM label Out of Line, was released containing the track "Forever." At the time, there were no online sources which could provide information on the band. Fans on the side-line.com forum expressed interest in the artist, but no one could initially provide information on the identity of the person or persons involved with the project.
thumb|left|Necessary Response in Salt Lake City, UT, 2008, supporting De/Vision.The name of the project, a play on the name of the band Imperative Reaction, was chosen as a result of an inside joke between Graves and a friend while also describing Graves' "musical situation at the time." http://vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=115 Graves created a MySpace account for Necessary Response using a false identity and location in Southern Sweden in an attempt to distance himself from the project and spark more interest. As a result, Graves was able to temporarily keep his identity a secret. Shortly before announcing the release date of the debut album, Graves added his own name and location to the bands' MySpace page and publicly admitted to being the artist behind the project.
On March 16, 2007 (coincidentally Graves' birthday) Blood Spills Not Far From the Wound was released, and in February 2008, Necessary Response toured the U.S. promoting the album and supporting synthpop act De/Vision.
On April 22, 2009, Daniel Graves posted a blog entry on the Necessary Response MySpace page effectively ending the project in order to focus on Aesthetic Perfection. That same year, Necessary Response performed their final concert at the Kinetik Festival in Montreal.http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=5605322&blogId=484770815
On September 13, 2012, Daniel Graves posted on the official Aesthetic Perfection Facebook page that "I wish there was a way to telepathically project, to everyone, that Necessary Response is dead, buried, and will not return... ever."https://www.facebook.com/aestheticperfection/posts/10151396979836521

The Vangelo is a high rank within the 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organisation in Calabria (Italy). Vangelo literally means GospelVangelo derives from the Greek word evagelio (ευαγγελιο) or its more popular rendition vangelio (βαγγελιο) and a member is called a vangelista (plural: vangelisti). The rank was established around 1978, when the rank of santista (a member of La Santa) became inflated because the original membership of 33 expanded.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 114-16
The grade was revealed by the historical pentito of the 'Ndrangheta Pino Scriva in 1984.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] 'Ndrangheta 2005, Nisio Palmieri, Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell’Associazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni  The vangelisti are “superior personalities who know the rights and obligations of the honoured society with decision-making duties at the highest level,” according to the pentito Francesco Fonti.[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p. 74
The referential religious figures are all the Apostles and Saint Peter and Saint Paul, while the historical figures are Giuseppe Mazzini as the founder and promoter of secret societies in general, and Count Camillo Benso di Cavour representing the mind of a statesman. 
Later, the rank of vangelista was followed by the institution of the position of trequartino (three-quarters) or quintino (fifth). Finally, the current highest rank of associazione (society) was established – reserved for the supreme bosses of the 'Ndrangheta. 
Important vangelista were Giuseppe Muià from Siderno, Domenico Martino, Sebastiano Romeo, Antonio Pelle and members from the Nirta family from San Luca.

CATEGORIES: 1962 births, Living people, Sudanese emigrants to Canada, Naturalized citizens of Canada, People from Montreal, People designated by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee

Abousfian Abdelrazik or Abu Sufian Abd Al-Razziq ([tpl]lang-ar|أبو سفيان عبدالرازق[/tpl]) is a Sudanese-born Canadian dual citizen.  On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury designated him as a supporter of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, but he was subsequently cleared in multiple investigations by the Sudanese government, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).  Following his imprisonment in Sudan, the Canadian government would not grant him travel papers and otherwise blocked his return to Canada. On June 4, 2009, the Federal Court ruled that his citizenship rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and ordered the Canadian government to facilitate his return. On June 27, 2009, Abdelrazik flew to Canada. 
Prior to his removal from the list, he was the only living Canadian on the United Nations security council blacklist, usually referred to as the "1267 List" after the number of the Security Council resolution which established it.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/video/abdelrazik-i-never-hurt-nobody-i-never-did-something-wrong/article1300281/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Abdelrazik: 'I never hurt nobody. I never did something wrong' | date=September 24, 2009[/tpl] The 1267 regime imposes sanctions on listed individuals, including a complete asset freeze and a ban on international travel. Upon his return to Canada, he sued the government for C$24-million, and C$3-million more for Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon's alleged “misfeasance in public office.” He has also launched a constitutional challenge to legislation implementing the 1267 regime in Canada. Abdelrazik's experience has been said to be similar to other Canadians such as Maher Arar, Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad El Maati, and Muayyed Nureddin.  Abdelrazik claims that he was tortured while in detention in Sudan and the Canadian government has admitted in court submissions that two CSIS agents interrogated him while he was in Sudanese custody.
Abdelrazik was removed from the United Nations security council blacklist on November 30, 2011.Nicholas Keung, "Canadian removed from UN terror watch list", Toronto Star, 30 November 2011.

CATEGORIES: 1985 albums, The Communards albums, Jimmy Somerville albums, London Records albums, Albums produced by Mike Thorne

   

Communards is the debut album by The Communards, released in 1986 (see 1986 in music) on London Records. The album was produced by Mike Thorne, who had previously produced Jimmy Somerville's earlier band, Bronski Beat. Although the singles released ahead of the album were only moderately successful, the first single to be lifted from it after release, "Don't Leave Me This Way", was number one in the UK for four weeks and was the top-selling single in the UK that year. During the single's four-week run at number one, the album itself reached a chart peak of number seven, going on to spend a total of 45 weeks in the UK Albums Chart.
Musically, the album contains tracks that largely fall into one of two styles, either Hi-NRG (all of the singles lifted from the album were in this style) or piano ballads showcasing the talents of Richard Coles, a classically-trained pianist. The standard "Lover Man" is arranged as a straight jazz number, albeit with the unusual twist of being performed as a duet.
The front sleeve features a stark graphic design consisting of the group's name and logo against a black background. A photo of the duo appears on the back, while the inner sleeve features small photos of Coles, Somerville and Sarah Jane Morris, alongside the album credits and full lyrics for all the songs.
Two songs had dedications in the sleevenotes: "Don't Leave Me This Way" was dedicated to the GLC, and "Reprise" to Margaret Hilda Thatcher.Communards, Communards. Edsel 2012 Deluxe Edition liner notes, p. 9

Liang Lingzan ([tpl]zh|s=梁令瓒|t=梁令瓚|p=Liáng Lìngzàn|w=Liang Ling-Tsan[/tpl]) was a Tang Dynasty military engineer and government official of the Kaiyuan era. He invented a mechanized water clock with the Tantric monk and mathematician Yi Xing ([tpl]zh|c=一行|p=Yī Xíng|w=I-Hsing[/tpl]).[tpl]cite book|last=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=Proceedings of the 2002 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|isbn=0-7918-3624-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Schafer | first = Edward H. | authorlink = Edward H. Schafer | title = Great Ages of Man: Ancient China | publisher = Time-Life Books | year = 1967 | location = New York | pages = 128 [/tpl] It was actually an astronomical instrument that served as a clock, made of bronze in the capital of Chang'an in the 720s. It was described by a contemporary text this way:
 
 It was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit ... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_/ai_6955890 |title=The mechanical clock - history of Chinese science |publisher=UNESCO Courier |accessdate=2008-04-16 |format= |work= | year=1988[/tpl]

In addition to being an engineer and official, Lingzan was also a scholar and artist. He wrote The Five-Planet and Twenty-eight Constellation Deities ([tpl]zh|c=五星二十八宿神形|p=wǔxīng èrshíbāxiù shénxíng[/tpl]), of which a Song Dynasty copy resides in the collection of the Osaka City Art Museum.[tpl]Cite book|author=Wang Yushu |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vy038L4xArAC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=liang+lingzan&source=web&ots=8FVoCpNNQB&sig=VAlMNFVUgi4qXCRYZUW0VmHbvUI&hl=en#PPA67,M1 |title=唐诗唐画中英对照: 英汉对照|accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl]

A major source of tension between the two countries was Kim Philby, a senior UK SIS officer who was a Soviet agent. Philby, at one point, was the SIS liaison officer resident in the US.

The Paradeplatz is a square at the Bahnhofstrasse in downtown Zürich. It is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Switzerland and has become synonymous with wealth and the Swiss banks, being the location of the headquarters of both UBS and Credit Suisse.
The site of the square lay without the medieval city walls, and was incorporated into the town with the construction of the new ramparts in 1642. During the 17th century, it served as a livestock market, known as Säumärt ("pig market"), renamed to Neumarkt "new market" in 1819 and finally to its current name  following the construction of Bahnhofstrasse (1865). The hotel Baur en Ville on the eastern end of the square opened in 1838. The Paradeplatz was the scene of clashes between insurgents and cantonal troops during the 1839 Züriputsch.  
The Confiserie Sprüngli at the southern end opened in 1859. The Credit Suisse (formerly Kreditanstalt) building at the northern end dates to 1873, the UBS (formerly Bankverein) building at the western end to 1897-1899. The first horse-drawn trams circulated in 1882 and were electrified in 1896.
Paradeplatz is one of the main nodal points of the Zürich tram network, and the stop is served by lines 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13.

[[CIA activities in Croatia]]
CATEGORIES: Politics of Croatia, Croatia–United States relations, CIA activities in Russia and Europe, United States–Yugoslavia relations

According to an intelligence memorandum, prepared by the Office of National Estimates with the Office of Current Intelligence, in 1972 Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito believed his actions in SR Croatia prevented civil war and, in particular, unwanted Soviet intervention. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suggested that while his public statements might have been exaggerated, he truly saw the situation as a crisis.
The crisis began in November 1971, with a strike of students at the University of Zagreb, protesting that Croatia was not getting its fair share of foreign exchange revenues. Tito, the report suggested, treated this as a resurgence of Croatian nationalism. This strike, as well as other protests, was endorsed by the liberal wing of the Croatian Communist Party.
In late November, having seen Croatian unrest developing since autumn, Tito returned early from a visit to Romania, and called a meeting of Croatian leaders, at his hunting lodge in Karadjordjevo, to discuss their concerns. While he found about two-thirds in agreement with his policy, he discovered a nucleus of defiance around Croatian Party President Savka Dabčević-Kučar and a Croatian representative on the Yugoslav Party Executive Bureau.
On 12 December, he made his observations public, saying the Croatian party "had ample warning of the protests" but did not act to prevent actions by "counterrevolutionary forces".  In part, he charged the Soviets of contacting people in Croatia and fomenting unrest, which the CIA believed was true. While he was concerned about separatism throughout Yugoslavia, he intended to act only with respect to Croatia. Dabčević-Kučar and several close associates resigned, 14 student leaders were arrested, and the Chief of Staff of the Zagreb Military District was suspended. A wave of resignations, mostly in protest, followed.
Tito apparently judged public opinion and support correctly by focusing action on the student leaders, and generally clamping down on university protest. There was no widespread public indignation about his actions against the students. He raised alarm about Soviet involvement, and spoke to the need for Yugoslav unity.
CIA found that the key factor in Tito's management of the crisis is that with the exception of the one suspended generals, he enjoyed complete military endorsement of his actions. The new Croatian government approved by  Tito still has  to deal with liberal sentiment. Tito wanted his federated system to continue, and believed Croatian liberals often had supported him.
One result is that he asserted control of the Party, which he had previously tried to guide  rather than command. He is now juggling the centralized national Party,and the military, against significant local parties. CIA saw this as inherently conflicted.
The CIA, however, estimated the chances as "better than even" that a single Yugoslavian state would continue after Tito's death.

Mór Muman (meaning Mór of Munster), also written Mór Mumhan or Mór Mumain, (said to have died 630s) is stated to have been a daughter of Áed Bennán, sometime King of Munster, but may in fact represent a euhemerised sovereignty goddess, particularly associated with the Eóganachta.MacKillop, "Mór Muman".
The Irish language tale Mór Muman 7 Aided Cuanach meic Ailchine (Mór Muman and the death of Cuanu mac Ailchine) is contained in the Book of Leinster. It is suggested that it dates from the 10th century or earlier.Wiley. According to this story, Mór was placed under an enchantment and lost her senses. She wandered Ireland for two years before she came to Cashel and the court of King Fíngen mac Áedo Duib. Fingen eventually slept with her, and her memory returned. In the morning, Fingen gave her the Queen's robe and brooch, and put aside his current Queen, daughter of the king of the Deisi, and put Mór in her place as she was of better blood. The Metrical Dindshenchas say of Fingen and Mór:  Best of the women of Inis Fail is Mór daughter of Áed Bennan. Better is Fingen than any hero that drives about Femen.Metrical Dindshenchas, volume 3, p. 203. 
When Fingen died, the story says, Mór Muman married Cathal mac Finguine. Unfortunately, the collector of this tale mistook this Cathal for his grandfather, Cathal mac Áedo.Byrne, Irish Kings, pp.204–207.
Mór's sister, Ruithchern, is also thought to represent the sovereignty goddess. She was the protagonist of the lost story Aithed Ruithcherne la Cuanu mac Cailchin (The killing of Ruithchern by Cuanu mac Ailchine).
As a divinity, Mór Muman is supposed to be identical with Mugain, and to include features of Medb and the Morrigan. She is sometimes referred to simply as Mumain, making her association with the land of Munster (Irish, Mumu) explicit.
The death of Mór Muman ingen Áedo Bennáin is recorded by the Annals of Ulster under the year 632 and by the Annals of Tigernach for 633.

The Hitachi TR.1 was a small airliner developed in Japan in 1938, produced in small numbers as the TR.2. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with retractable tailwheel undercarriage and a fully enclosed cabin. The design strongly resembled the Airspeed Envoy that it was intended to replace in Japanese airline service. Testing of the TR.1 prototype commenced on 8 April 1938 at Haneda Airport, but it suffered a serious accident on 22 June due to a landing in which one of the main undercarriage units failed to extend. 
The TR.2 was a revised and strengthened design with a larger wing area, and main undercarriage that only semi-retracted. Twelve examples were built in a small series, but performance was not as good as the TR.1, since the modifications to the design had added 260 kg (570 lb) to the aircraft.

However, with the opening of the Eagle Creek-Cascade Locks segment of the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail in 1998, it has become easily accessible by foot or bicycle.[tpl]cite newspaper |first=Jackie |last=Scott |newspaper=The Oregonian |title=Trail opens window to old forest |date=December 17, 1998 |page=ME1 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070319092217/http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ag-forst/1998-December/012364.html |accessdate=2011-07-01[/tpl] (archived copy) The park is on a triangular lot, completely surrounded by I-84 and the Mount Hood National Forest.
The park was acquired in 1923 from the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company by the Parks Division of the State Highway Department, which named it for Philip H. Sheridan. It served as a wayside on US 30 - the Historic Columbia River Highway - until 1960, when the new I-84 freeway replaced the old road, cutting off access except through the national forest. As part of the restoration of the old highway, the Federal Highway Administration rebuilt the abandoned Eagle Creek-Cascade Locks for non-motorized traffic in the 1990s, to be managed by the State Parks and Recreation Department. An interpretive sign was installed at the site in 2007.Friends of the Historic Columbia River Highway, [tpl]cite web |publisher=Friends of the Historic Columbia River Highway |url=http://hcrh.org/events.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430034038/http://hcrh.org/events.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |title=Events: Historic Columbia River Highway Interpretive Sites and Signs Grand Opening |accessdate=2011-07-01[/tpl]
Just to the east of the park, within the national forest the trail passes under I-84 in a 150-foot (50 m) long precast concrete rock-faced tunnel ([tpl]coord|45.6501|N|121.9107|W|type:landmark_region:US[/tpl]). The $500,000 structure was built as part of the restoration project, and was required to connect the park to another intact piece of road, located north of I-84 at the west Cascade Locks interchange.

[[Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye]]

CATEGORIES: 2004 films, American avant-garde and experimental films

Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye is a 2004 experimental film adaptation of the 1928 novel Story of the Eye by the French writer Georges Bataille.  The film, directed by Andrew Repasky McElhinney, takes place in a seemingly abandoned house where a group of people engage in wordless acts of passion.  The film covers a period from evening to morning, and the sexual couplings among the members of the house becomes increasingly harrowing as daylight arrives.Mk Magazine News: Film: Georges Bataille's Story Of The Eye
Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye began as a video installation before being reconfigured into a feature-length film. It had its New York theatrical premiere in September 2004, and its support was led by Dave Kehr of the New York Times, who wrote of the production; “This is transgression in a literal sense, an act of aggression that Bataille would no doubt have appreciated. This is not a movie for passive consumption, but a film that bites back.”The New York Times > Movies > Movie Review | 'Georges Bataille's Story of the Eye': Exploring the Temptation to Look (and to Look Away)

[[Atlanta Pops Symphony Orchestra]]

CATEGORIES: American orchestras, Pops orchestras, Musical groups established in 1945

The Atlanta Pops Orchestra was established in 1945 and was run by Albert Coleman. Albert Coleman, a French immigrant, began working at WSB Radio in Atlanta, Georgia in 1944. At the time- he saw a need to gather what he considered to be the best musicians to form the Atlanta Pops Orchestra. The orchestra was to play for radio dates, public concerts,and free performances to benefit the arts, the area youth, and aspiring musicians. The Atlanta Pops became known throughout the southeast as a result of concerts free to local audiences in Atlanta. Albert was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to both the orchestra and the multitude of young artists whose careers were assisted by him an for the diversity and longevity of his involvement in the arts in Georgia.
They have received two dozen Grammy Awards.http://www.atlanta.net/visitors/atlanta_symphony_orchestra.html
Albert Coleman retired in 1998 and between 1998 and 2002 the orchestra performed under guest conductors for mainly private events. In 2002 the management was assumed by Altieri & Associates Entertainment, Inc. an Atlanta management, booking and musical contracting company. John Head was the principal conductor from 2002 to 2010 at which time Mr. Head retired and Dr. Jason D. Altieri was officially hired as the Conductor and Music Director. Jason Altieri is also the Associated Conductor of the Reno Philharmonic in Nevada as well as guest conducting nationally and internationally.
Under Dr. Altieri, the Pops has broadened its original musical goals to include corporate events as well as school clinics and concerts and entire community concert series. The orchestra is also planning to perform an even wider variety of programs that will include church concerts. It hires its own members to perform in Broadway shows visiting Atlanta and in other tours and celebrity shows appearing in this area such as Mannheim Steamroller, Celtic Woman, Johnny Mathis and many others over the recent past.
Albert Coleman died in December 2007, but the Atlanta Pops symphony continues to feature a broad range of guest soloists and emerging talent.

Team Dynamik is a former V8 Supercar team. The team began within the Konica V8 Lites Series (now Dunlop V8 Supercar Series) in 2001 and won the Championship in its first season with driver Simon Wills. Wills won 10 of the season's 18 races, including a clean sweep at the finale in Mallala. In 2003 the team moved into the V8 Supercar Championship Series and was based in Adelaide, the only major V8 Supercar team to be based in South Australia, with Kiwi drivers Simon Wills (son of team principal Kieran Wills) and Jason Richards, the pair nearly winning the prestigious Sandown 500.
Results were much more difficult to come by in 2004, with Dale Brede replacing Jason Richards. After being caught testing illegally in Woomera in mid-2004, the team was partially bought out by Tony Longhurst Racing in 2005. Neither team has since competed in V8 Supercars.

[[Wild fisheries]]
CATEGORIES: Fisheries

A fishery is an area with an associated fish or aquatic population which is harvested for its commercial value. Fisheries can be marine (saltwater) or freshwater. They can also be wild or farmed. This article is an overview of the habitats occupied by the worlds' wild fisheries, and the human impacts on those habitats.
Wild fisheries are sometimes called capture fisheries. The aquatic life they support is not controlled in any meaningful way and needs to be "captured" or fished. Wild fisheries exist primarily in the oceans, and particularly around coasts and continental shelves. They also exist in lakes and rivers. Issues with wild fisheries are overfishing and pollution. Significant wild fisheries have collapsed or are in danger of collapsing, due to overfishing and pollution. Overall, production from the world's wild fisheries has levelled out, and may be starting to decline.
As a contrast to wild fisheries, farmed fisheries can operate in sheltered coastal waters, in rivers, lakes and ponds, or in enclosed bodies of water such as tanks. Farmed fisheries are technological in nature, and revolve around developments in aquaculture. Farmed fisheries are expanding, and Chinese aquaculture in particular is making many advances.  Nevertheless, the majority of fish consumed by humans continues to be sourced from wild fisheries.  As of the early 21st century, fish is humanity's only significant wild food source.

The Church of the Deposition of the Robe ([tpl]lang-ru|Церковь Ризоположения[/tpl]) is a church which stands on Cathedral Square in the Moscow Kremlin. It was begun in 1484 by masters from Pskov, most likely by the same group of architects who built the adjacent Cathedral of the Annunciation.Shvidkovsky, Dmitry. Russian Architecture and the West, Yale University Press, 2007. ISBN 0-300-10912-1
The church was built on the site of a previous church, built by Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow in 1451."Discovering the Kremlin", kremlin.ru. Retrieved on April 28, 2008. The name of the church, variously translated as the Church of the Virgin's Robe, The Church of Laying Our Lady’s Holy Robe, The Church of the Veil or simply Church of the Deposition, is said to refer to a festival dating from the 5th century AD, celebrating when the robe of the Virgin Mary was taken from Palestine to Constantinople, where it protected the city from being conquered."Cathedrals of the Moscow Kremlin", Voice of Russia, May 15, 2007. Retrieved on April 28, 2008. For example, tradition says that during the Rus'-Byzantine War of 860 the patriarch placed the Virgin's Robe into the sea, causing a storm that destroyed the invading Rus' ships.Turnbull, Stephen. The Walls of Constantinople, AD 324–1453, Osprey Publishing, p.48–49. ISBN 1-84176-759-X
A four-level iconostasis, created by Nazary Istomin Savin in 1627, has been preserved in the church, and has frescoes painted by Ivan Borisov, Sidor Pospeev and Semyon Abramov in 1644. The church itself was built in the traditional Early Russian style, characterized by "a noticeable tendency towards more elevated proportions, the overall structure being extended by being placed on raised foundations, and the drum supporting the single dome also being raised." As with the Cathedral of the Annunciation, the intricate interior detail and ornamentation were characteristic of the Russian architecture of this period.
Originally, the church served as the private chapel of the Patriarch of Moscow, but during the mid-17th century it was taken over by the Russian royal family.Carlisle, Olga. "In the heart of Moscow", The New York Times, October 22, 1989. Retrieved on April 28, 2008. The church was badly damaged in a fire in 1737 (the same fire that cracked the Tsar Bell).
Today, the church also houses a display of wood sculpture from the 14th to 19th century.

The Treaty of Axim was concluded between the Netherlands and the chiefs of Axim in the western region of the Gold Coast (West Africa) and signed at Fort St. Anthony near Axim on 17 February 1642. The treaty regulated the jurisdiction of the Netherlands and the Dutch West India Company in the town and polity of Axim after the Dutch West India Company had successfully attacked the Portuguese who were the occupants of Fort St. Anthony in the town. Over time, the agreement was in part superseded and replaced by new contracts and agreements. The treaty did remain the basis for Dutch jurisdiction and political relations between Axim and the Dutch until the latter left the Gold Coast in 1872.

[[Clifford Mayes]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, American educators, Jungian pedagogues, Brigham Young University faculty, 1953 births

Clifford Mayes (born 1953) is an American professor of educational psychology and multicultural theory in the Brigham Young University McKay School of Education.
A Jungian scholar, Mayes has produced the first [tpl]Ref|1[/tpl]  book-length studies in English on the pedagogical applications of Jungian and neo-Jungian psychology, which is based on the work of Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961).[tpl]Ref|1[/tpl] Jungian psychology is also called analytical psychology. His work, based in humanities and depth psychology, is thought to offer an alternative to the social sciences paradigm that is generally used in educational research.[tpl]Ref|2[/tpl]
Mayes has developed what he has termed archetypal pedagogy. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. Archetypal reflectivity, which draws not only upon Jungian psychology but transpersonal psychology generally, offers an avenue for teachers to probe the spiritual dimensions of teaching and learning in non-dogmatic terms.[tpl]Ref|3[/tpl]
Two of Mayes' most recent works, Inside Education: Depth Psychology in Teaching and Learning (2007) and The Archetypal Hero's Journey in Teaching and  Learning: A Study in Jungian Pedagogy (2010), incorporate the psychoanalytic theories of Heinz Kohut (particularly Kohut's notion of the selfobject) and the object relations theory of Ronald Fairbairn and D.W. Winnicott. Some of Mayes' work in curriculum theory, especially Seven Curricular Landscapes: An Approach to the Holistic Curriculum (2003) and Understanding the Whole Student: Holistic Multicultural Education (2007), is concerned with holistic education. The latter text is one of the first to extend the holistic approach into the area of multicultural education. His most recent book, Psyche as Spirit: Foundations of Jungian Psychology, will appear in mid-2013 through Atwood Publishing. Mayes has written on various topics in Jungian Sand Tray Therapy. Additionally, he has examined parallels between Mormon theology and classical Jungian psychology. 
See also Wikipedia article on Archetype. 
Mayes holds a doctorate in the cultural foundations of education from the University of Utah and a doctorate in psychology from Southern California University for Professional Studies.

[tpl]refimprove|date=December 2012[/tpl]

Desmodium triflorum is an ornamental plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to Florida, Hawaii, and some small areas of other southern states of the United States. It is a creeper, a vine that grows along the ground as opposed to growing up trees or buildings. It has three leaves with smooth edges and a white stripe up the middle, ranging from a bright white to a barely visible grey stripe, depending on the nutrients of the soil. The stems of the plants are either green, red, or both, with minuscule hairs along them. The seeds are in pods that cling to clothing and hair, not unlike velcro. The plant relies on this system to spread growth of the plant. D. triflorum is highly resistant to grazing or mowing, which makes it very difficult to get rid of. 
The plant also contains a significant amount of DMT, or dimethyltryptamine, a powerful psychedelic. Some speculate that the Seminole Indians used this plant ritually to the same degree as peyote. The US Drug Enforcement Administration has attempted to criminalize this plant, but due to its commonness, neglected the effort, saying that too few people knew of its effect to be worried.

[[Lineament]]
CATEGORIES: Geomorphology, Structural geology

See also Line (geometry)
A lineament is a linear feature in a landscape which is an expression of an underlying geological structure such as a fault. Typically a lineament will comprise a fault-aligned valley, a series of fault or fold-aligned hills, a straight coastline or indeed a combination of these features. Fracture zones, shear zones and igneous intrusions such as dykes can also give rise to lineaments.
Lineaments are often apparent in geological or topographic maps and can appear obvious on aerial or satellite photographs. There are for example, several instances within Great Britain.  In Scotland the Great Glen Fault and Highland Boundary Fault give rise to lineaments as does the Malvern Line in western England and the Neath Disturbance in South Wales.
The term 'megalineament' has been used to describe such features on a continental scale. The trace of the San Andreas Fault might be considered an example.Whitten & Brooks, The Penguin Dictionary of Geology 1972
The Trans Brazilian Lineament and the Trans-Saharan Belt, taken together, form perhaps the longest coherent shear zone on the Earth, extending for about 4,000 km.[ref]
</ref>
Lineaments have also been identified on other planets and their moons. Their origins may be radically different from those of terrestrial lineaments due to the differing tectonic processes involved.

[[Laissez-faire racism]]

CATEGORIES: Racism, Racism in the United States

Laissez-Faire Racism (a.k.a. symbolic racism) is closely related to color blindness and covert racism, and is theorized to encompass an ideology that blames minorities for their poorer economic situations, viewing it as the result of cultural inferiority.[tpl]cite book|title=Sociology: understanding a diverse society|author=Margaret L. Andersen and Howard Francis Taylor|pages=279|edition=4th|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2005|isbn=9780534617165[/tpl]http://books.google.com/books?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sociology:+understanding+a+diverse+society&source=bl&ots=i_97BJ-M01&sig=mLWMbu2xroZH5J2ohtQRNHr-SJk&hl=en&ei=RmBWS_vkGJPu0wTPpcz_BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBQQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=&f=false The term is used largely by scholars of whiteness studies, who are critical of this theorized ideology, while no one does or would self-identify as holding it.
Dr. Lawrence D. Bobo, Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University, and Ryan Smith use this term to represent how the racial outlooks of white Americans have shifted from the more overtly racist Jim Crow attitudes—which endorsed school segregation, advocated for governmentally imposed discrimination, and embraced the idea that minorities were biologically inferior to whites—to a more subtle form of racism that continues to rationalize the ongoing problem of racial oppression in the United States. Laissez-faire racists claim to support equality while maintaining negative, stereotypical beliefs about minorities.Bobo, Lawrence & Ryan Smith. "From Jim Crow Racism to Laissez-Faire Racism: The Transformation of Racial Attitudes." In Beyond Pluralism. Ed Katkin, Landsman & Tyree. University of Illinois Press. 1998.http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ722544&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ722544
Katherine Tarca writes that laissez-faire racism is the belief, stated or implied through actions, that one can end racial inequality and discrimination by refusing to acknowledge that race and racial discrimination exists. Laissez-faire racism has two main ideas: first, the belief in the melting pot and America’s assertion of ideas of equal opportunity, regardless of race. Second, laissez-faire racism encompasses the ideology of how individual deficiencies explain the problems of entire social groups. Tarca explains that Whites tend to view laissez-faire racism as being beneficial to people of color, while many minorities believe that these ideologies contrast and ignore the realities facing many minorities in America.Tarca, Katherine. "Colorblind in Control: The risks of Resisting Difference Amid Demographic Change." Educational Studies (American Educational Studies Association) Vol 38 Issue 2. pgs 99-120. 
Eduardo Bonilla Silva, who is a professor of sociology at Duke University, suggests that all groups of people in power construct these ideologies in order to justify social inequalities.http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/24_2/07_TXT.htm For example, most racial ideologies today are more inclined to omit unfashionable racist language, which protects racial privilege by employing certain philosophies of liberalism in a more conceptual and decontextualized approach. These ideologies help to reinforce the existing condition of affairs by concentrating on cultural distinctions as the cause of the inferior accomplishments of minorities in education and employment. These ideas are primarily focused on the more darker-skinned minorities, such as, African-Americans,  Asians and  Latinos.  Ideologies like these refuse to acknowledge the systematic oppression, such as the continuing school segregation or persistent negative racial stereotypes that continue to occur in American society.Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo.

PFZW currently uses the PGGM brand to market its asset management services. is the second largest pension fund in the Netherlands.  As of 31 March 2014, PFZW had total assets under management of €142.8 billionhttp://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/home/kassen-vol-maar-pensioenen-niet-hoger#node_804341 ($197 billion, 1EUR=1.38USD) and around 2.6 million participants.http://www.pfzw.nl/Over_ons/Over_ons/Over_ons.asp
PFZW's predecessor, PGGM, was founded in June 1969 through the combination of several smaller Dutch pension funds in the healthcare industry.  In 1970, PGGM assumed responsibility for the pensions of employees throughout the health care and social work sectors in the Netherlands.  In 1972, PGGM moved to its current headquarters in Zeist, Netherlands.
PFZW is as a non-profit foundation, controlled by trade unions and employers from the healthcare and social work sectors.  At the end of 2006, the governing board of what was then known as PGGM adopted a separation between its policy (structuring of pensions) and implementation (managing of assets and payment) functions.  The pension fund (the foundation) continues to formulate pension policy, but was renamed Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn (PFZW), and a newly created cooperative PGGM now manages the fund’s €110.7 billionhttp://www.rtl.nl/components/financien/rtlz/nieuws/2012/03/Nederlands-pensioenbezit-stijgt-naar-875-miljard-euro.xml of assets under management.  This separation, which took effect in January 2008, was taken in response to new legislation passed in the Netherlands that would limit PGGM’s ability to offer related financial services.

Each machi-bugyo was involved in tax collection, policing, and firefighting; and at the same time, each played a number of judicial roles –- hearing and deciding both ordinary civil cases and criminal cases.
In this period, the machi-bugyo were considered equal in status to the minor daimyō.  At any one time, there were as many as 16 machi-bugyo located throughout Japan; and there was always at least one in Kyoto.

Camp Edwards is a United States military training installation which is located in western Barnstable County, Massachusetts. It forms the largest part of Joint Base Cape Cod, which also includes Otis Air National Guard Base and Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. It was named after Major General Clarence Edwards. It is home to the 3rd Battalion, 126th Aviation.
In 1931 the National Guard deemed Camp Devens to be too small to meet their needs and began to look for a new training area, and two years later Cape Cod was identified as having a suitable environment to build a new camp.  Camp Edwards was officially dedicated in 1938.
In 1940, the U.S. Army leased Camp Edwards as a training facility as part of its mobilization strategy for World War II.  The Army undertook significant construction which helped to expand Camp Edwards from a rustic military post to a small city, overflowing with new GIs. The new plan called for new capacity to house 30,000 soldiers and was completed in just four months.  At the peak of the construction, 30 buildings were completed every day. During the war, the camp functioned as a sending off point for troops as well as a training ground for anti-aircraft units. The camp continued to function this way until the war ended.
With the end of the war, Camp Edwards was deactivated. The Air Force took control of nearby Otis Field in 1948, and Otis Air Force Base was born. During the Korean War, the camp was reactivated to train troops. After the war, the camp was again deactivated. The camp was never reactivated for the Vietnam War, but training did go on occasionally.
Camp Edwards was subject to a closure attempt in the 1990s, but survived after objections from the military community. During Hurricane Katrina, the camp was utilized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, opening up to 2,500 refugees.
Today, the Camp is home to two training centers for National Guard troops. These training centers, which are the only ones in the Northeast other than those at Fort Drum and Fort Dix, are meant to simulate a middle-eastern town.

[[Ever Green]]

CATEGORIES: West End musicals, 1930 musicals, Original musicals, Musicals by Rodgers and Hart, London in fiction

Ever Green is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers, lyrics by Lorenz Hart and a book by Benn Levy, based on an idea by Rodgers and Hart. This was the last of three musicals written by Rodgers and Hart in London.
The musical premiered on 3 December 1930 at the newly renovated Adelphi Theatre, London. It was produced by Charles B. Cochran and directed by Frank Collins with choreography by Buddy Bradley and Billy Pierce. It starred dancer Jessie Matthews (who played both the mother and the daughter) and comedian Sonnie Hale, who married her the following year. It also featured Joyce Barbour and Jean Cadell. 
The lavish production was noted for the setpiece "Dancing on the Ceiling" that used London's first revolving stage. In this, the two stars danced around a huge chandelier that was standing up from the floor, simulating the ceiling. Matthews subsequently adopted "Dancing on the Ceiling" (also known as "He dances overhead") as her signature tune. The show was Matthews' biggest stage success and led to her renowned film career.Nolan, Frederick. Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway (1994) Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-510289-4
The musical garnered critical and box office success, running for 254 performances. It was later adapted into a successful 1934 film also starring Matthews.

[[Alpine regiments of the Roman army]]

CATEGORIES: Military of ancient Rome, Military units and formations of the Roman Empire, Auxiliary infantry units of ancient Rome, Auxiliary equitata units of ancient Rome

The Alpine regiments of the Roman army were those auxiliary units of the army that were originally raised in the Alpine provinces of the Roman Empire: Tres Alpes, Raetia and Noricum. All these regions were inhabited by predominantly Celtic-speaking tribes. They were annexed, or at least occupied, by the emperor Augustus' forces during the period 25-14 BC. The term "Alpine" is used geographically in this context and does not necessarily imply that the regiments in question were specialised in mountain warfare. However, in the Julio-Claudian period (ante AD 68), when the regiments were still largely composed of Alpine recruits, it is likely that they were especially adept at mountain operations.
As would be expected from mountain people, the Alpine provinces predominantly supplied infantry; only one Alpine cavalry ala is recorded. About 26 Alpine regiments were raised in the Julio-Claudian period, the great majority under Augustus or his successor Tiberius (i.e. before AD 37). Of these, 6 regiments disappeared, either destroyed in action or disbanded, by AD 68. A further 2 regiments were raised by Vespasian (ruled 69-96). These and the 20 surviving Julio-Claudian units are recorded at least until the mid 2nd century, but by that time only around a quarter were still based in the Alpine provinces or in neighbouring Germania Superior (Upper Rhine area). The rest were scattered all over the empire and would probably have long since lost their ethnic Alpine identity through local recruitment.

[tpl]nihongo|Edo ''machi-bugyō|江戸町奉行|[/tpl] were magistrates or municipal administrators with responsibility for governing and maintaining order in the shogunal city of Edo.Hall, John Wesley. (1955) Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, p. 201 Machi-bugyō were samurai officials of the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo period Japan.  Appointments to this prominent office were usually fudai daimyo, but this was amongst the senior administrative posts open to those who were not daimyo.Beasley, William G. (1955). Select Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853-1868,'' p. 325. Conventional interpretations have construed these Japanese titles as "commissioner" or "overseer" or "governor."
During the Edo period, there were generally two hatamoto serving simultaneously as Edo machi-bugyō.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Edo-machi bugyō" in [tpl]Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia, p. 168|page=168[/tpl]; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, see Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File.  There were two Edo machi-bugyō-sho within the jurisdictional limits of metropolitan Edo; and during the years from 1702 though 1719, there was also a third appointed machi-bugyō.Cunningham, Don. (2004). Taiho-Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, p. 39.
The Edo machi-bugyō were the central public authorities in this significant urban center.  These men were bakufu-appointed officials fulfilling a unique role.  They were an amalgam of chief of police, judge, and mayor.  The machi-bugyō were expected to manage a full range of administrative and judicial responsibilities.Cunningham, Don. (2004). Taiho-Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, p. 42.
Each machi-bugyō was involved in tax collection, policing, and firefighting; and at the same time, each played a number of judicial roles—hearing and deciding both ordinary civil cases and criminal cases.
In this period, the machi-bugyō were considered equal in status to the minor daimyo.  At any one time, there were as many as 16 machi-bugyō located throughout Japan, and there were always two in Edo.

There are number of open source online tools to handle exams conducted on OMR sheets.Quiz OMR" : An extension to Moodle to provide online support for offline quizzes conducted on OMR sheets http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=3601
Computer-aided assessment can be viewed in a few different ways. Technically, assignments that are written on a computer and researched online are computer-aided assessments.  One of the most common forms of computer-aided assessment (in terms of e-learning) is online quizzes or exams. These can be implemented online, and also marked by the computer by putting the answers in. Many content management systems will have easy to setup and use systems for online exams.
It is also envisaged that computer-based formative assessment, in particular, will play an increasingly important role in learning,Gomersall 2005 with the increased use of banks of question items for the construction and delivery of dynamic, on-demand assessments. This can be witnessed by current projects such as the SQA's SOLAR Project.Scottish Qualifications Authority 2008

[[Arch Social Club]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history in Baltimore, Maryland, Culture of Baltimore, Maryland, Music venues in Maryland

The Arch Social Club was casually founded in 1905 and officially incorporated on March 15, 1912. The club is very much a child of Baltimore’s brutally repressive racial environment. Black people at the dawn of the 20th century were savagely pushed to the political, social, cultural and economic margins by a combination of white folkways and state statutes. Out of necessity, African Americans sought collective survival in the construction of a parallel civil society. Schools, churches, benevolent associations, commercial enterprises, cultural venues and every conceivable social institution that addressed the exclusionary nature of the broader white society and day-to-day needs of Black folk were forged–often in the face of de jure, race-driven harassment and humiliation.
Raymond A. Coates, Jeremiah S. Hill and Sam L. Barney founded the Arch Social Club. It was dedicated to:  [T}he social, moral and intellectual uplift of its members, and in order that charity may be practiced in a Christian-like spirit and true friendship and brotherly love be promoted and maintained. “
For over 100 years, Arch Social has been a fixture of Black Baltimore's civil society. Many scholars have asserted that Arch Social is the oldest known, continuously operating African American men's club in the United States. 
The club rapidly attracted a broad cross-section of Black Baltimore's population, as it was religiously/politically non-sectarian, multi-class and color-caste neutral. It was a pioneering Black civil societal institution at the dawn of the 20th century.
Long associated with entertainment, the Arch Social Club is actually a benevolent and community action formation. Application for membership is by invitation only. It's clubhouse also applies a strict dress code for anyone attending events. 
For 50 years (1922-1972), the organization occupied a clubhouse at 676 West Saratoga Street (downtown-west Baltimore). The historic structure was demolished in an urban renewal scheme.
The new clubhouse has stood at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and West North Avenue (2426 Pennsylvania Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21217) since 1972.
The Arch Social Clubhouse is the last remaining venue for live entertainment (especially Jazz) on Baltimore's historic Pennsylvania Avenue commercial strip.

[[Barack the Magic Negro]]

"Barack the Magic Negro" is a song by American political satirist Paul Shanklin who wrote and recorded it for the Rush Limbaugh Show as satire after the title phrase was first applied to presidential candidate Obama by movie and culture critic David Ehrenstein in a Los Angeles Times op ed column of March 19, 2007. It was played numerous times in 2007 and 2008 by Rush Limbaugh and appeared on the 2008 album We Hate the USA. It is sung by Shanklin to the tune of "Puff, the Magic Dragon". Shanklin impersonates black activist Al Sharpton, who regretfully sings that white people will vote for Barack Obama for President instead of Sharpton, because Obama is a magical Negro (a term previously popularized by Spike Lee[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n21/story3.html |title=Yale Bulletin and Calendar |publisher=Yale.edu |date=2001-03-02 |accessdate=2012-01-15[/tpl]), not a real black man from the "hood".
Limbaugh was criticized and accused of racism for playing the song. The controversy was reignited in December 2008, when Chip Saltsman, a candidate for chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent out CDs containing the song to 168 other RNC members as a Christmas gift, hoping to bolster his 2009 campaign for RNC chair. The move backfired, Saltsman dropped his bid to head the RNC, and ultimately African American Republican Michael Steele won the chairmanship.

[[Petroleum industry in China]]
CATEGORIES: Petroleum in China, Petroleum industry by country

Since 1949, the petroleum industry in China has been strongly affected by the country's growing population and political ideology, as well as its lack of domestic oil reserves. It highlights the current structure of the government, their relationship with surrounding states, and steps they are taking to play a positive role in the worldwide community.  
China has a growing population of over 1.3 billion people; therefore they rely heavily on other states for resources, such as oil. The Chinese government is taking diplomatic action to improve their relationship with ASEAN states. The Chinese government has to take extra strides to secure good relationships with its neighbors. Malaysia is a neighbor state that is often seen as in contention with China because of political differences. Yet, the relationship with Malaysia is symbiotic because of their large supply of oil and their need for security assurances from China. Malaysia is the number one producer of petroleum in the South China Sea, and they account for over one half of the production in the region."South China Sea and Natural Gas." Global Security. 2 April  2008 
A big role is played in China's oil endowment by its state owned oil companies, mainly China National Offshore Oil Corp, China National Petroleum Corp, China National Refinery Corp, and Sinopec.

[[Livin' in the Life]]
CATEGORIES: 1977 singles, The Isley Brothers songs

"Livin' in the Life" is the second song released from The Isley Brothers' 1977 album, Go for Your Guns. It was also the next-to-last song on the album, which only included seven tracks, with the last track actually a "part two" version of the song under the title of the album, in which was led by Ernie Isley, brother Marvin and Chris Jasper.
Much like the band's 1975 hit, "Fight the Power", it was written by Ernie Isley and, in some parts, lead singer Ronald Isley and his brothers, Rudolph and Kelly, tripled in unison lead vocals though Ronald remained the dominant vocalist over the three. Ronald also helps close out the ending of the album before it fades.
The song became a hit on the R&B and dance charts, reaching #4 on the former, while also crossing over on the top 40 of the pop charts, reaching #40, making it their first top 40 pop hit in little over two years.

[[Austempering]]
CATEGORIES: Metal heat treatments

Austempering is heat treatment that is applied to ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite. It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reduce / eliminate distortion. Austempering is defined by both the process and the resultant microstructure. Typical austempering process parameters applied to an unsuitable material will not result in the formation of bainite or ausferrite and thus the final product will not be called austempered. Both microstructures may also be produced via other methods. For example, they may be produced as-cast or air cooled with the proper alloy content. These materials are also not referred to as austempered.

[[Bob Dunn (musician)]]

CATEGORIES: Western swing performers, Musicians from Oklahoma, 1908 births, 1971 deaths

Robert Lee "Bob" Dunn (February 5, 1908 - May 27, 1971) was an American jazz trombonist and a pioneer Western swing steel guitarist.DeCurtis, Present Tense, p. 17-18: In San Antonio Rose, his exhaustive study of life and music of western-swing kingpin Bob wills and his Texas Playboys, Charles Townshend sic offers fragmentary but suggestive evidence that T-Bone Walker and Charlie Christian, the front-runners in the first generation of black electric guitarists, were inspired, at least in part, by the early amplified playing of white musicians such as Dunn and McAuliffe. ... Western-swing and jazz present a similar continuum on the white side of the tracks, with men like McAuliffe a jazzy but heavily country-inflected style, while mavericks like Dunn played a kind of pure, futuristic jazz all their own. And every one of these player, black and white, was solidly grounded in the blues." Although much influenced by influential, key Hawaiian lap steel guitar player Sol Hoopi, Dunn played in his own original bluesy style and was the first to record an electric guitar, preceding other country & western guitarists following him shortly. He preceded by over three years George Barnes (with Big Bill Broonzy in 1938), Leonard Ware and, slightly later, Eddie Durham.
Bob Dunn is noted as the first musician to record an electrically amplified instrument—as a member of Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies—on January 27, 1935.Oliphant, "Texas Jazz", p. 23: "Prior to Durham's first recorded performance, Bob Dunn had recorded with the Texas Western Swing unit of Milton Brown and His Music Brownies on January 27 and 28, 1935. On this date, dunn played an amplified steel guitar, which primarily was utilized for Hawaiian music."
Dunn also played steel guitar in numerous other Western swing groups including those of Cliff Bruner and one of Moon Mullican's earlier bands. Dunn also had his own group, The Vagabonds, featuring Mullican and Cliff Bruner.
Dunn was inducted into to the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1992.

[[Self-categorization theory]]

Self-categorization theory is a social psychological theory that describes the circumstances under which a person will perceive collections of people (including themselves) as a group, as well as the consequences of perceiving people in group terms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Haslam|first=S.

A percolation trench, also called an infiltration trench, is a type of best management practice (BMP) that is used to manage stormwater runoff, prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay.  It is a shallow excavated trench filled with gravel or crushed stone that is designed to infiltrate stormwater though permeable soils into the groundwater aquifer.Metropolitan Council. St. Paul, MN. "Minnesota Urban Small Sites Best Management Practice Manual." "Infiltration Trenches." July 2001.
A percolation trench is similar to a dry well, which is typically an excavated hole filled with gravel.Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Boston, MA. "Massachusetts Low Impact Development Toolkit."

Crown Burgers is a small hamburger fast food restaurant chain based in Salt Lake City, Utah started in 1978 by John & Rula Katzourakis and Nick Katsanevas (Rula’s brother).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slweekly.com/article.cfm/greeksbearingburgers|title=Greeks Bearing Burgers|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper=Salt Lake City Weekly|year=1995|author=Ted McDonough|archiveurl=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/article-2479-greeks-bearing-burgers.html|archivedate=11 June 2007[/tpl]  
The chain's signature burger is the "Crown Burger," a cheeseburger which, in addition to the char-broiled patty, is piled high with hot pastrami.  Crown Burgers' pastrami burger has been widely imitated and has become a staple of restaurant cuisine in Salt Lake City.[tpl]cite news|author=John T. Edge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/dining/29united.html?hpw|title=Pastrami Meets the Patty in Utah|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 July 2009[/tpl]  In 2004, Carl's Jr. released a very similar burger called the "Pastrami Burger." Crown Burgers offers other fast food fare as well, such as beef burritos, hot pastrami sandwiches, steak sandwiches, gyros, fishburgers, fries, onion rings, and other burgers. Crown Burgers also carries its own version of the regional condiment fry sauce, a combination of ketchup, mayonnaise and spices. 
Their primary location is decorated like a European hunting lodge, complete with a large fireplace, inviting fireside chats. Other locations have a medieval theme complete with tapestries and heavy iron chandeliers. Like most other fast-food restaurants, customers place orders at a counter and pick up paper-wrapped food when their numbers are called. From the counter, customers can see pastrami being freshly sliced.
Crown Burgers has seven Salt Lake City locations.
In 2010, Crown was featured in an episode of Travel Channel's Man v. Food and named as serving The Official Best Burgers of Utah in 2011.[tpl]cite web|title=Watch Crown Burgers videos: Man v.

[[Mesoamerican region]]
CATEGORIES: Economic geography, Economy of North America, Economy of Central America, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

The Mesoamerican region (often abbreviated MAR) is a trans-national economic region in the Americas that is recognized by the OECD and other economic and developmental organizations, comprising the united economies of the seven countries in Central America — Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama — plus nine southeastern states of Mexico — Campeche, Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, Veracruz, and Yucatán.OECD (2006, pp.13,36)
Designated as an 'economic territory' by the OECD, the identification of the Mesoamerican region as a focus for common regional economic development has been observed since the adoption in 2001 by the signatory countries of the Puebla-Panama Plan (PPP), an initiative intended to foster regional integration and development across southeastern Mexico and the countries of Central America.See OECD (2006, p.13 n.1, also p.36). The PPP also includes the country of Colombia; other than this, the territory and governments involved with the PPP are the same as those covered by OECD's Mesoamerican region.
Situated within the wider region of Middle America (on the tapering isthmus of southern North America), the geographical region defined by the MAR loosely correlates with that of Mesoamerica, the pre-Columbian culture area defined and identified by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists and ethnohistorians.By a narrow definition often encountered, the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture area excludes Panama and significant portions of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador. The area in-between southern Mesoamerica and the central Andes has been known as the Intermediate Area, a term increasingly deprecated by pre-Columbian scholars in favor of more updated regionalizations such as Isthmo-Colombian.   For several thousand years prior to the European colonization of the Americas beginning in the early 16th century, the diverse cultures and civilizations of Mesoamerica also shared in common a number of broad cultural, historical and linguistic traits. The modern-day indigenous populations who are the descendants of pre-Columbian cultures number roughly over 11 million people (approx. 17.2% of total regional population) spread across the MAR economic territory,OECD rough estimate compiled from various sources and years ranging 2000–2003, see OECD (2006, p.69, and p.80, n.14). The estimate excludes El Salvador, as the Salvadoran government does not maintain statistics or distinguish between indigenous and non-indigenous categories. and are largely among the most disadvantaged and marginalized groups in the region.OECD (2006, pp.17,69–70)

Interminority racism is prejudice or discrimination between social subordinate groups.  It is controversial to call it racism because of theories of power in society.  However, prejudiced thinking does occur between minority groups.  There are examples on public and personal levels.  This article strictly addresses interminority racism as it exists in the United States of America, even though it happens in many other countries.

The Equitable Building is a high-rise located in Des Moines, Iowa.  It is named after the insurance company Equitable of Iowa, which originally owned the building, and is located along Locust Street in the downtown area of the city.  The 19-story Equitable Building, at 604 Locust St. in Des Moines, was completed in 1924, and standing at 318 ft (97m), for 49 years was the tallest building in Iowa. It remained the tallest building in Iowa for almost 50 years, until the completion of Financial Center in 1973. The Equitable Building is now the eighth tallest building in Iowa.[tpl]cite web|title=Equitable Building | url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=10348 | publisher=skyscraperpage.com | accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Equitable Building, Des Moines | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=equitablebuilding-desmoines-ia-usa | publisher=emporis.com | accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl]

On May 5, 2009, Equitable L.P. was ordered to pay a $500,000 environmental civil penalty for conducting extensive renovations of the historic Equitable Building in downtown Des Moines without taking required precautions for the presence of asbestos-containing material.  “This is the largest civil penalty by far in Iowa for asbestos violations,” said Attorney General Tom Miller. “We alleged Equitable L.P. completely ignored asbestos-handling requirements during renovations from 2005 to 2007, until the Iowa DNR became involved.”  Iowa Attorney General Press Release (May 5, 2009) http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/may_2009/Equitable_LP2.html
Asbestos – which often is present in older building materials – is regulated as a hazardous air pollutant. It can cause lung disease and cancer, especially if it is contained in dust when asbestos-containing material is crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder. State and federal laws and regulations have stringent requirements for handling regulated asbestos-containing material during demolition or renovations.
The Attorney General’s Office filed a lawsuit May 5, 2009 alleging numerous violations from 2005 to 2008. At the same time, Polk County District Court Judge D.J. Stovall entered a “Consent Order, Judgment and Decree” that was agreed-to by the parties and resolved the suit. Under the Consent Order, Equitable L.P. admitted to specific violations and agreed to pay the $500,000 civil penalty to the State of Iowa. Judge Stovall also permanently prohibited any further violations.to: http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/may_2009/Equitable_enviro_%20PETITION.pdf. [Go to http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/may_2009/Equitable_enviro_CNSNT.pdf
Department of Natural Resources Director Richard Leopold said the amount of the civil penalty underscores the importance of properly handling and disposing of asbestos during renovation and demolition projects.  “What’s important to remember is that asbestos poses potentially serious health implications and that we do not have a situation like this happen again,” Leopold said. “This enforcement action should serve as a warning that the regulations relating to asbestos removal and disposal will be vigorously enforced.”
The Attorney General’s lawsuit vs. Equitable L.P.:
The Attorney General’s lawsuit alleged that Equitable L.P., while renovating the top 13 floors of the Equitable Building from 2005 to 2008, failed to inspect for asbestos, failed to provide notice to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, failed to remove asbestos-containing material before renovation, failed to properly handle the asbestos-containing material disturbed during the renovation, and failed to properly dispose of the material. The first six floors were occupied during the renovation.
The Polk County Health Dept. forwarded an anonymous complaint about the renovation project to the DNR in the latter part of 2007, and the DNR investigated and documented numerous violations. The DNR issued an administrative order requiring Equitable L.P. to stop activities until all floors were thoroughly inspected and all asbestos-containing material was removed by a licensed asbestos-abatement contractor – but Equitable L.P. continued with renovation in violation of the order, the suit alleged. 
The DNR issued a second Notice of Violation to Equitable L.P. in February 2008 for failing to comply with the earlier DNR administrative order. The renovations were completed in 2008 with no additional violations reported.
In the Consent Order, Judgment and Decree entered May 5, 2009, Equitable L.P. admitted that it: 
Failed to thoroughly inspect the Equitable Building for the presence of asbestos prior to starting renovation activities. 
Failed to submit written notice of renovation activities to the DNR before beginning the renovation.
Conducted the building renovation without taking precautions for the potential presence of asbestos-containing material.
The Criminal Case
A federal grand jury indicted Russell Coco, the supervisor of the Equitable Building renovation, and developer Bob Knapp, owner of the building, on 11 counts, accusing them of gutting several floors of the Equitable Building while large amounts of asbestos were present, then improperly disposing of the material.
Bob Knapp pleaded guilty to two charges in February 2011 for his role at the head of a conspiracy to ignore federal asbestos regulations during a three-year renovation project at the Equitable Building.  Knapp was sentenced on June 22, 2011, to 41 months behind bars.http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/06/22/bob-knapp-sentenced-to-41-months-for-equitable-building-asbestos/
Knapp was paroled on March 25th, 2014. On March 30th, 2014, Knapp was found dead in a burned out car near Panora, Iowa, after stealing it from an acquaintance in Waukee whom he had been staying with. Federal authorities had reported Knapp to have escaped home confinement.http://www.kcci.com/news/person-found-dead-in-burned-out-vehicle/25252116
Russell Coco also pleaded guilty in February to charges of conspiracy to impede and impair Environmental Protection Agency asbestos removal procedures and violations of the work practice requirements of the Clean Air Act.  Coco was sentenced on July 13, 2011, to three years of probation for his involvement in the illegal removal of asbestos from the building.http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20110714/NEWS01/107140340/1001/

The missions of the Su Altı Savunma (SAS) include coastal defence operations, such as clearing mines or unexploded torpedoes, and disabling enemy vessels or weapons with underwater operations; as well as counter-terrorism and VIP protection.
The first S.A.S. and S.A.T. units were established in 1963 in the city of Iskenderun, following a joint training program with the US Navy SEALs from San Diego. The original name of the S.A.S. unit was Su Altı Müdafaa (S.A.M.), while the original name of the S.A.T. unit was Su Altı Komando (S.A.K.), and they were bound to the Kurtarma ve Sualtı Komutanlığı (K.S.K.), or Rescue and Underwater Command. In 1974 the S.A.S. and S.A.T. group commands became bound to the Turkish Navy's General Command, and participated in the Turkish military invasion of Cyprus later that year.
The S.A.S. and S.A.T. are based in the Foça Naval Base near İzmir, on the Aegean coast of Turkey.

[[Let's Be Friends and Slay the Dragon Together]]
CATEGORIES: Suburban Legends albums, 2008 albums

Let's Be Friends... and Slay the Dragon Together, commonly referred to as Let's Be Friends, is Suburban Legends' fourth album, released on July 10, 2008. During the run up to its release some members of the band had shared information about the album, notably announcing that the band will be bringing back some of the ska sound it had left in 2006 with its EP, Dance Like Nobody's Watching. Unlike previous album Infectious which explored many different styles and genres, Let's Be Friends is much more focused while mixing elements of previous albums.
The album, based on the theme of 'Let's Be Friends', features the members representing styles of music on the cover, with Vincent Walker as a rapper, Brian Robertson as a robot, Luis Beza as a mariachi musician, Mike Hachey as a cowboy, Derek Lee Rock as a disco dancer, and Brian Klemm as a 1980s metal musician.
In 2009, Let's Be Friends was nominated for an Orange County Music Award for Best Album.
The album's final song, "Natasha", is a hidden track, and is about Brian Klemm's cat Natasha, as stated by Brian himself.
The ... and Slay the Dragon Together portion was also of Brian Klemm's doing, telling fans willing to listen that he had to fight to get it in the album's title.
Additionally, the song "Fire" is a recounting of the band's misfortune when they became the victims of a van fire and robbery while in St. Louis, Missouri.  The band often mentions this after performing the song at shows in St. Louis, most recently stated by Brian Robertson at the 23 November 2008 show at The Bluebird.
The song "Villain" is a direct reference to the Joker of Batman and DC fame, mainly because Brian Klemm is quite the comic book lover.

[[Poeta Saxo]]

CATEGORIES: Saxons, Carolingian Latin writers, German Christian monks, 9th-century writers

The anonymous Saxon poet known as Poeta Saxo, who composed the medieval Latin Annales de gestis Caroli magni imperatoris libri quinque ("Annals of the Deeds of Emperor Charlemagne in Five Books") was probably a monk of Sankt Gallen or possibly Corvey. His Annales is one of the earliest poetic treatments of annalistic material and one of the earliest historical works to concentrate on Saxony. It is considered characateristic of the dénouement of the Carolingian Renaissance.
The Saxon identity of the poet is implicit in only two places in the text of his poem, as when he refers to the Saxons as "our people" in lines 687–690.Godman, 344–45. He probably began collecting oral tradition about Charlemagne, the conqueror of the Saxons, 883, but he soon graduated to annalistic texts, such as the Annales regni Francorum as compiled under Einhard, and biographic works, like Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni;J. Bohn in his dissertation, Der Poeta Saxo in der historiographischen Tradition des 8.–10. Jahrhunderts (University of Frankfurt, 1965), provides a full account of Poeta's sources. he composed his poem between 888 and 891, during the reign of Arnulf of Carinthia, whom he addresses. The Poeta was steeped in classical poetry and schooled in rhetoric. The Annales gives evidence of his having access to now lost annals and he has been a source for historians, though most literary critics offer less praise, noting that the Poeta is a versifier who simply tansformed prose annals into metric ones with little original contribution.
He "goes beyond received and conventional ideas", however, in portraying Charlemagne as superior to the Roman emperors, standing beside Constantine in Heaven, and famous as David (this idea came from Charlemagne's court nickname).Godman, 78. In the final book, where the Poet depicts the nations on Judgement Day, he has each nation led by a different apostle: Peter leads the Jews and Paul leads the Gentiles, under whom Andrew leads the Greeks, John the Asians, Matthew the Ethiopians, Thomas the Indians, and Charlemagne the Saxons.Godman, 344–45, lines 679–685. The Poeta is among the saved Saxons who enter Christ's presence; it is for this reason that he overlooks the brutality of Charlemagne's conquest of his people, for with Charlemagne came Christian salvation.
Among the pieces of history for which only the Poeta is a source are the commendation of the Danish chieftain Halfdan to Charlemagne in 807 and the existence of vernacular Germanic poems and songs about Germanic heroes of the past. About the latter the Poeta writes: Est quoque iam notum: vulgaria carmina magnis / Laudibus eius avos et proavos celebrant, / Pippinos, Carolos, Hludowicos et Theodricos / Et Carlomannos Hlothariosque canunt ("As is well known, vernacular poems celebrate and praise / his grandfathers and great grandfathers; / of Pippin, Charles, Louis, and Theoderic / Carlomann and Lothar are their songs made").Godman, 342–43, line 117–20. The Poeta also refers to the people of Europe over whom the Romans did not hold sway yet who are subjects of Charlemagne.
The identification of the Poeta with Agius of Corvey was refuted by Karl Strecker and more recently by H. F. Stiene. Rita Lejeune and Timothy Reuter see the Annales as the predecessor of French epic poetry and romance. The Poeta was probably a source for Widukind of Corvey.Leyser, 170.
Of the five books of the 2,691-line Annales, the first four are in hexameters while the last is in elegiac distichs. The first critical edition of the Poeta's poem was G. H. Pertz, MGH SS, II (Hanover, 1829), which was replaced by an updated version by Paul von Winterfeld in the Poetarum Latinorum Medii Aevi Tomus IV, i (Berlin, 1909). Parts of books I and II appeared in Godman (1985) with English translation.

Strathcona Canadian Pacific Railway Station was built by the Calgary and Edmonton Railway in what was then the City of Strathcona, Alberta.  The station was started in 1907, completed in 1908, and expanded in 1910, and is located at what is now 8101 Gateway Boulevard, just south of Whyte Avenue.
The building was initially the northern terminus of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway serving Strathcona and Edmonton, although Canadian Pacific later expanded that line north across the North Saskatchewan River via the High Level Bridge into Edmonton proper.  The  building was designated a Canadian Heritage Railway Station in 1991,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/clmhc-hsmbc/gfp-hrs/ab_e.asp |title=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada - Heritage Railway Stations - List of designated stations in Alberta |accessdate=2010-03-03[/tpl] when it was still owned by CP and therefore subject to federal regulation.

CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), Living people, South African academics, African philosophers, Antinatalism

David Benatar is professor of philosophy and head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa.University of Cape Town Philosophy Department Staff He is best known for his advocacy of antinatalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings.[ref]
</ref>
Benatar argues from the uncontroversial premise that pain is, in itself, a bad thing.[tpl]cite book |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199296422.001.0001 | last = Benatar | first = David | title = Better Never to Have Been | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | location = | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-929642-2 [/tpl] Nevertheless, he offers qualified defenses of the corporal punishment of childrenDavid Benatar, "Corporal Punishment", in: Social Theory and Practice, vol. 24 (1998), pp. 237-260. and the circumcision of male infants (which he deems a matter for parental discretion).Michael Benatar, David Benatar, "Between Prophylaxis and Child Abuse: The Ethics of Neonatal Circumcision," in: David Benatar, ed., Cutting to the Core: Exploring the Ethics of Contested Surgeries (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2006), pp. 23-46. He is the author of a series of widely cited papers in medical ethics, including "Between Prophylaxis and Child Abuse" (The American Journal of Bioethics) and "A Pain in the Fetus: Toward Ending Confusion about Fetal Pain" (Bioethics). 
Benatar's work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism. In an interview with True Detective creator and writer Nic Pizzolatto, Benatar's Better Never to Have Been is cited as an influence on the TV series, along with Ray Brassier's Nihil Unbound, Thomas Ligotti's The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, Jim Crawford's Confessions of an Antinatalist, and Eugene Thacker's In The Dust of This Planet."Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of True Detective."
His work has been published in such journals as Ethics, Journal of Applied Philosophy, Social Theory and Practice, American Philosophical Quarterly, QJM: An International Journal of Medicine, Journal of Law and Religion and the British Medical Journal.
Benatar's The Second Sexism: Discrimination against Men and Boys (2012) has been met with controversy.The philosopher Simon Blackburn writes: "Benatar knows that such examples are likely to meet snorts of disbelief or derision, but he is careful to back up his claims with empirical data, and as a philosopher he is especially careful both about the interpretation of evidence and the use of terms such as "discrimination". ... I do not at all doubt that there is a case to be made for the recognition of a second sexism, nor that Benatar makes it well. And it is not as if he himself is taking sides in these invidious comparisons. He is not a participant in the sex wars but a peacemaker who wants them to wind down. All that he aims to show is that if it is all too often tough being a woman, it is also sometimes tough being a man, and that any failure to recognise this risks distorting what should be everyone's goal, namely universal sympathy as well as social justice for all, regardless of gender." Times Higher Education review, 5 July 2012, retrieved 27 August 2012. The philosopher Iddo Landau writes: "Benatar suggests that in order to cope with the hitherto ignored second sexism we should not only acknowledge it but also dedicate much more empirical and philosophical research to this under-explored topic and, of course, try to change many attitudes, social norms, and laws. / This is a very well-argued book that presents an unorthodox thesis and defends it ably. It would be a useful text in both undergraduate and graduate courses in philosophy and gender studies, where it is certain to arouse a lot of discussion, much of it excited. ... Most importantly ... it is likely to change our understanding of gender relations." Metapsychology online reviews, 21 August 2012, retrieved 27 August 2012.Suzanne Moore, a columnist for The Guardian and The Sunday Mail, writes: "... abundant tripe trickles down from on high, even academe. Every so often a new tome details how men, not women, are discriminated against (apart from rape, murder, equal pay, genital mutilation, the power imbalance in politics, business, education, law and arts they may have a point). Things are tough for some guys. Really, I know that. I just find it hard to accept feminism has gone too far, that a bit of underarm hair signals the end of western civilisation." The Guardian, 16 May 2012, "The Second Sexism is just victim-envy", retrieved 27 August 2012. In a brief letter to The Guardian, Benatar sought to correct some errors in Moore's account of his views; The Guardian, 18 May 2012, "Men and sexism", retrieved 27 August 2012. Benatar had predicted criticisms in the book: "Forestalling Some Fallacies / Given the prevailing orthodoxy in the academy and the sensitivity of the issues I shall be discussing, the views I defend in this book will be deemed threatening by many. I am under no illusions. My position, no matter how clearly stated, is likely to be misunderstood."Benatar, The Second Sexism, p. 16.

 John “Jock” Rattray (born Lumphinnans, Scotland) was an early twentieth-century Scottish football inside forward who played professionally in Scotland and the United States.
“When actively engaged in the sport Rattray was one of the versatile type of players. He was equally effective on the halfback line as he was among the forwards, and frequently alternated in the positions of right halfback and inside right.”6 September 1924 The Globe
In 1911, Rattray began his professional career with Falkirk F.C. of the Scottish Football League First Division.  He spent two seasons at Falkirk before transferring to Raith Rovers in 1913, but his career was interrupted, along with so many others, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.  Rattray served in a Scottish regiment in the British Army during the war, not returning to football until January 1919 when he signed with Dumbarton F.C.  In 1922, Rattray left Scotland to sign with the Bethlehem Steel F.C. of the American Soccer League.[tpl]cite book | last = Jose | first = Colin | title = American Soccer League, 1921-1931 | type = Hardback | publisher = The Scarecrow Press | year = 1998 | id = (ISBN 0-8108-3429-4) [/tpl]  His last game with the team came in the final of the 1924 American Cup.  He was not slated to start the game, but was written in to fill in for an injured team mate.  His selection paid dividends when he scored the game’s lone goal, giving Steel its sixth American Cup title.  Rattray retired following the 1923-1924 season, returning to Scotland where he settled in Cowdenbeath.
In recognition of his service to Raith Rovers, he was awarded a Benefit match, which was played against a Fifeshire Select on 4 January 1921.

[[Data deduplication]]
CATEGORIES: Data management, Data compression

In computing, data deduplication is a specialized data compression technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data. Related and somewhat synonymous terms are intelligent (data) compression and single-instance (data) storage. This technique is used to improve storage utilization and can also be applied to network data transfers to reduce the number of bytes that must be sent. In the deduplication process, unique chunks of data, or byte patterns, are identified and stored during a process of analysis. As the analysis continues, other chunks are compared to the stored copy and whenever a match occurs, the redundant chunk is replaced with a small reference that points to the stored chunk. Given that the same byte pattern may occur dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of times (the match frequency is dependent on the chunk size), the amount of data that must be stored or transferred can be greatly reduced."Understanding Data Deduplication" Druva, 2009. Retrieved 2013-2-13
This type of deduplication is different from that performed by standard file-compression tools, such as LZ77 and LZ78. Whereas these tools identify short repeated substrings inside individual files, the intent of storage-based data deduplication is to inspect large volumes of data and identify large sections – such as entire files or large sections of files – that are identical, in order to store only one copy of it. This copy may be additionally compressed by single-file compression techniques. For example a typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same 1 MB (megabyte) file attachment. Each time the email platform is backed up, all 100 instances of the attachment are saved, requiring 100 MB storage space. With data deduplication, only one instance of the attachment is actually stored; the subsequent instances are referenced back to the saved copy for deduplication ratio of roughly 100 to 1.

Thought to be the site of the Canaanite royal city of Jokneam, during Roman rule in Palestine millennia later, it was a city whose name is transcribed by Eusebius of Caesarea as Cammona, and by Jerome, as Cimana. During the Crusades, Caymon was a valuable fiefdom, granted to Balian of Ibelin by Saladin. Incorporated into the empires to rule Palestine that followed, it often was referred to by locals in conjunction with its neighbouring village, as Qira wa Qamun. The occupation of Qira and Qamun by pre-state Israeli forces on 1 March 1948 resulted in the depopulation of both villages.

They inhabit areas with near 100% humidity and constant temperatures, and they prey on springtails. Since they can only be found underground, research on these creatures has been difficult. Their distribution is limited and unknown reproductive rates mean that it is possible they are especially susceptible to habitat destruction and other threats. Texella reddelli are found on both the North and South sides of the Colorado River.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/beecreekcaveharvestman/ |title=Bee Creek Cave Harvestman (Texella reddelli) |publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |accessdate=August 20, 2010[/tpl]

The Army began its creation on 27 June 1941 mostly from the previously raised 168 destroyer battalions intended to deal with expected enemy saboteurs and parachutists, reporting directly to the commander of Northern Front (Soviet Union). The personnel was drawn from the reserve officer cadres, retired officers, workers and students of Leningrad.
The initial intention was to create an army with seven divisions, but eventually 10 divisions were raised.http://centralsector.narod.ru/no_c.htm#1x Narodnoe Opolcheniye in the Battle for Leningrad (A short chronology) compiled by candidate of historical sciences Yu.N.

Kwongan is a type of heathland found on the coastal plains of Western Australia. The name is derived from the language of the Noongar people. Kwongan comprises floristically-rich heath with dense thickets of sclerophyllous shrubs and isolated small trees. It is characterised by nutrient-poor sandy soils, frequent wildfire, a very high level of endemism, spectacular displays of wildflowers in spring, and a Mediterranean climate with winter rainfall and hot, dry summers.  
Kwongan is found on the Swan Coastal Plain from Cape Naturaliste to Perth, though large areas have been destroyed. It is in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome, and has similarities to the Mediterranean Maquis, the Californian Chaparral, the Chilean Matorral, and the Fynbos of South Africa.[tpl]NatGeo ecoregion|id=aa1205|name=Kwongan heathlands[/tpl]

A proposed Royal veto of the appointment of bishops was a contentious topic in the politics of the United Kingdom, in the period 1808 to 1829. According to the proposal, any restoration of the full episcopal hierarchy of the Catholic Church, in Great Britain, should be subject to a veto of the Crown over the appointment of any bishop whose loyalty was suspect.
The matter was eventually resolved by the passage of Catholic Emancipation without such a condition.

Sheikh Abdullah Nimar Darwish (Arabic: عبد الله نمر درويش, born in 1948) is the founder of the Islamic Movement in Israel.
Darwish was born Kafr Qasim in 1948. After completing his religious studies in Nablus, he returned to Kafr Qasim and began advocating a return to Islam and Islamic tradition, and subsequently established the [Islamic Movement in Israel in 1971.
In 1979, Darwish established an underground organization called Usrat al-Jihad ("The Family of Jihad"), whose goal was to establish "an Arab Islamic state in Palestine." Two years later, he was arrested together with several accomplices, and convicted of membership in a terrorist organization. He remained in prison until 1985, when he was freed as part of the Jibril Agreement between the government of Israel and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/jcss/sa/v2n4p5.html |publisher=Tel-Aviv University |work=Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies: Strategic Assessment |title=The Islamic Movement in Israel |date=February 2000 |accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Following his release, Darwish became publicly active and began to express opposition to Israeli Arabs taking part in violent behavior.

Today, he remains the spiritual leader of the Southern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel and serves as the chairman of an organization which arranges for interfaith dialogue between Muslims, Jews and Christians. He has expressed a commitment to the rule of law, and to integration into the State of Israel and its institutions. In a 2001 newspaper interview, he said:
 
 Whoever establishes a movement that is based on violation of the law, does not represent us. However, in the West Bank and Gaza there is no rule of law, there is an occupation which must be eliminated, and not a state which must be respected. Therefore, I understand the Palestinians or the Lebanese, which are rising up in any way they can... If I were being occupied, I too would rise up, but the moment I decided that I am a part of the state as long as I am within the borders of the Green Line, I obey the law, together with my representatives in the Knesset, and this is proof that I do recognize the State of Israel. This despite the fact that I too feel as though I am under mental occupation, but the world does not see that.[tpl]cite news| publisher=Iton Tel-Aviv (In Hebrew) | title=In the Name of the Qu'ran |author=Eti Abramov | accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]

Mosè Giacomo Bertoni or Moisés Santiago Bertoni (15 June 1857 – 19 September 1929) was a Swiss botanist of italian ethnicity. He emigrated to South America in 1884 and lived in Paraguay from 1887 until he died in 1929.
Bertoni discovered and classified many new species of plants and left an impressive collection of more than 7000 vegetal species and about 6500 insects.  His work and research in botany, meteorology, and anthropology has been a great contribution to the scientific knowledge of the natural life in Paraguay.  His work gave him both national and international recognition. One of the plants he studied in depth was ka'a he'ê (Stevia rebaudiana), which is a herb, indigenous of Paraguay, and is important today as a non-caloric sweetener, reputed to be 300 times sweeter than sugar. He also scientifically classified Yerba maté (Ilex paraguariensis).
Widely known as el Sabio Bertoni (the wise Bertoni), he is regarded as one of the most extraordinary immigrants to ever arrive in Paraguayan lands.
He was born in the small village of Lottigna, canton Ticino, Italian-speaking region in Switzerland, a June 15, 1857, the son of Ambrose Bertoni, a lawyer, remarkable jurist, and official, and political ticinense Josefina Torreani, a teacher from Milan.
He died on September 19, 1929, at the age of 72 years in the city of Foz do Iguazu (Brazil), of malaria, and his remains rest in Puerto Bertoni, Paraguay, below large trees, very close to his workplace.

It is the most widespread of the Australian Mistletoes, occurring mainly to the west of the Great Dividing Range.  It has shiny leaves and red flowers arranged in groups of 3. It is distinguished from the similar Amyema pendula through the individual stalks of the flowers.
The seeds are dispersed by various birds, particularly by the mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum) that eat the fruit and then either wipes the sticky remains from the beak or when defecating has to wipe it from its feathers onto, most often, a twig due to the extremely sticky nature of the seed.
The seed immediately begins to germinate and soon penetrates the vascular system of the tree and creates a physiological connection with the Xylem of the new host. From that point, the seedling begins to obtain water and mineral nutrients from the host.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/mistletoe/what-is-mistletoe.html|title=What is a mistletoe ?|last=Barlow|first=Bryan |date= 21 August 2008|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Australian Government|accessdate=9 November 2011|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory[/tpl]

Baron Raimund von zur-Mühlen (sometimes "Raymond", "Raimund von Zur Mühlen") (10 November 1854 in Uusna Manor (Neu-Tennasilm), Viljandi Parish (now in Viiratsi Parish), Viljandi County, Governorate of Livonia – 11 December 1931 in Wiston, near Steyning, England) was a celebrated tenor Lieder singer who also became a famous teacher of singing, instructing many famous artists. His Lieder-interpretations are legendary.
He was a student of Auguste Hohenschildt,aka Auguste Hohenschild Felix Schmidt, Adolf Schulze, Julius Stockhausen and Clara Schumann.[tpl]cite book|last=Slonimsky|first=Nicolas|title=Baker's Biographical dictionary of musicians.|year=1978|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York|isbn=0-02-870240-9|pages=1954|edition=6th|chapter=Zur Mühlen, Raimund von[/tpl]  He made his debut in 1878, together with Hans Schmidt, in Riga. After this he continued working on his capabilities as a singer, above all with Manuel Garcia, Beniamino Carelli and Pauline Viardot.This paragraph derived from German wikipedia. 
He is recognised as a founder of the Lieder-abend or evening recital of the German concert Lieder as a distinct performance entity. His interpretation of Lieder and his specialist study of Lieder interpretation were of the utmost importance in the evolution of the Lieder genre itself. He gave Schumann Lieder-recitals with Clara Schumann. She set him on the path to London, where he gave his first concert in 1883. At one of his concerts, Johannes Brahms shouted out, 'Endlich, endlich habe ich meinen Sänger gefunden!' (At last, at last, I have found my singer).
Thereafter he spent much time in London. In 1907 he emigrated to England, with homes in London and Steyning. His last stay in Germany must have been in 1913-1914 in Berlin, where he gave a course of Masterclasses. Thereafter he lived in England for the remainder of his life. Here he met for the last time Monika Hunnius, author and singing-teacher, who had regularly studied with him in 1904-1911 at the Schloss Fellin at Neuhäuser, and developed a deep friendship with him.
In his younger days he usually appeared with his habitual accompanist and kindred spirit Hans Schmidt. Among his later accompanists were Victor BiegelElwes 1935, 129. and Coenraad V. Bos. Bos mentions him in his book: the singer gave his young accompanist no encouragement, but criticized him severely. After their fifth concert together he was told 'You must have played well today, for I did not notice you.'Cited in G. Moore, Am I Too Loud (Harmondsworth 1966, 40). He was the teacher of Lula Mysz-Gmeiner (who taught Elisabeth Schwarzkopf), of Mark Raphael, Hans Lissman, Eva Jekelius-Lissman, Rose Walter, Eide Norena, Martha Lipton, Georg A. Walter, Fanny Opfer, Naima Wifstrand, and Hermann Weissenborn, among many others.
He was considered an ideal Lieder singer. He is also described as an eccentric. He was born of an aristocratic family. His valuable collection of documents, musical and artistic papers were destroyed in 1930 in a great fire at his house near Steyning.German wikipedia.

William J. Roberts (born 1907, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. He was born in Birmingham.
While playing amateur football for Flint Town United, Roberts impressed enough for the club to sign him on a full contract in 1928. During his four years at Ninian Park the club fell into a serious decline that saw them fall from  division one to division three in the space of four years. Roberts was a virtual ever present during the freefall and scored his only goal for the Bluebirds in December 1929 during a 5-2 win over Southampton. He parted company with the club at the end of the 1932-33 season and did play professional football again.

The Jibril Agreement was a prisoner exchange deal which took place on May 21, 1985 between the Israeli government, headed by Shimon Peres, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command. As part of the agreement, Israel released 1,150 security prisoners held in Israeli prisons in exchange for three Israeli prisoners (Yosef Grof, Nissim Salem, Hezi Shai) captured during the First Lebanon War. This was one of several prisoner exchange agreements carried out between Israel and groups it classified as terrorist organizations around that time. [ref]
See מלחמת שלום הגליל Website of IDF Spokesman and
The Committee for the Investigation of the Lebanon War 2006, http://www.vaadatwino.org.il/pdf/%E3%E5%E7%20%F1%E5%F4%E9.pdf Final Report pages 502-503.[/ref] Among the prisoners released by Israel were Kozo Okamoto - one of the perpetrators of the Lod Airport Massacre who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Ahmed Yasin—a Gazan Muslim Brotherhood leader (and later spiritual leader of Hamas)—who was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in 1983.
The Israeli government faced harsh public criticism for agreeing to release 1,150 security prisoners, among them those sentenced to life imprisonment and responsible for the killing of many Israeli citizens, particularly since the exchange did not include Israelis who were captured in the Battle of Sultan Yacoub. One of the Israeli negotiators resigned in protest against the agreement. All of the government ministers, with the exception of Yitzhak Navon, supported the agreement.
A large number of the Palestinian prisoners released in this agreement later went on to form the backbone of the leadership of the First Intifada, which broke out less than three years after the agreement.

[[Roman Catholic relief bills]]

CATEGORIES: Political history of the United Kingdom, History of religion in the United Kingdom

The Roman Catholic Relief Bills were a series of measures introduced over time in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries before the Parliaments of Great Britain and the United Kingdom to remove the restrictions and prohibitions imposed on British and Irish Catholics during the English Reformation. These restrictions had been introduced to enforce the separation of the English church from the Roman Catholic Church which began in 1529 under Henry VIII.
Following the death of the Jacobite claimant to the British throne James Francis Edward Stuart on 1 January 1766, the Pope recognised the legitimacy of the Hanoverian dynasty, which began a process of rapprochement between the Catholic Church and the United Kingdom. Over the next sixty-three years, various bills were introduced in Parliament to repeal restrictions against practise of the Roman Catholic faith, but these bills encountered political opposition, especially during the Napoleonic Wars. With the exception of the Catholic Relief Act 1778 and the Catholic Relief Act 1791, these bills were defeated. Then, finally, most of the remaining restrictions against Catholics in the United Kingdom were repealed by the Catholic Relief Act 1829.

[[Syed Shamsul Hasan]]
CATEGORIES: 1885 births, 1981 deaths, Leaders of All India Muslim League, Pakistani politicians, Leaders of the Pakistan Movement

Syed Shamsul Hasan (1885-1981) was an eminent leader of the Pakistan Muslim League and before independence of All India Muslim League. He was the son of a doctor and wanted to follow his father’s footstep. However, his passion for politics led him to Sir Syed Wazir Hasan at an early age. The remarkable personal qualities that separated Syed Shamsul Hasan from his peers were his modesty, self-effacement, self discipline and friendly nature. Later in life these qualities made him the most trusted vanguard of Quaid-i-Azam and Liaquat Ali Khan.
As Pir Ali Mohammad Rashdi, a journalist, said “ The driving force behind the movement independent Pakistan were three people- the Quaid, Liaquat and Syed Shamsul Hasan.
Syed Shamsul Hasan joined the staff of the All India Muslim League (AIML) in July 1914 as Assistant Secretary, and after a short while he took over charge of party’s central office as Secretary. He held this position till independence South Asia into India and Pakistan. Syed Shamsul Hasan was the major player behind the scenes. The importance of his role in Pakistan’s independence was realized after his death. He was not only responsible for running day to day league operations and financial management, but also keeping in touch with all the league leaders including Liaquat Ali Khan and Allama Iqbal and keeping Quaid informed. He was famous for his quick thinking, for example he once was accompanying Quaid on his Lucknow trip and on their way in came to Syed sahib’s attention that in Lucknow Quaid-i-Azam had been portrayed as “Maulana” Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In his western dress, Quaid does not look like Maulana. Quaid-i-Azam decided not to care about this concern. However, Syed sahib found a quick solution. He went to the market when train stops at Kanpur station and bought about dozen Fez caps, also known as Turkish caps. Quaid-i-Azam happily chose one and kept his image of “Maulana” in Lucknow league session.
Syed Shamsul Hasan’s intelligence and quick wits made him one of most trusted member of AIML. He was known to protect Quaid and Liaquat Ali Khan’s back and equipped them with tools that are needed to continue the struggle for an independent state. He was the only one who was entrusted by Quaid himself to safeguard and responsible to transfer the AIML records safely from Delhi to Pakistan. Syed Shamsul Hasan accomplished this task without any concern of putting his or his entire family’s life in danger. After the bifurcation of the All India Muslim League in 1948 into the Indian Union Muslim League and Pakistan Muslim League, Syed Shamsul Hasan served Pakistan Muslim League in the same capacity till October 1958.
When Iskandar Mirza declared martial law on October 7, 1958, all political parties were banned; their offices and records were taken over and sealed by this regime. Twenty days later Ayub Khan over thrown Iskandar Mirza and became the first military president of Pakistan. He took charge of all AIML records, put this real history of Pakistan in Hessian bags, removed from the site and left to decay on open rooftop of the Muslim league house. Part of it was destroyed until National Archive Researchers managed to retrieve the remnants in later years. The papers which Quaid-i-Azam had entrusted to Syed Sahib, known as Shamsul Hasan Collection, were entirely protected even after his death. His eldest son Syed Khalid Shamsul Hasan took over his father’s responsibility and created Shamsul Hasan foundation for research. In 2006, this historical treasure was donated to National Documentation Center of Cabinet Division, Government of Pakistan.

[[Cowboys and Aliens (album)]]
CATEGORIES: Kitchens of Distinction albums, 1994 albums, Albums produced by Pete Bartlett, Albums produced by Pascal Gabriel, One Little Indian Records albums

Cowboys and Aliens is the fourth studio album by British alternative rock band Kitchens of Distinction, released on October 3, 1994 in the UK by One Little Indian Records and on January 24, 1995 by A&M Records in the US.
The album was recorded in Kippford, Scotland at Pete Bartlett's Radio King studio through the summer and autumn of 1993. One Little Indian rejected the album twice, and eventually, both label and band agreed to bring in up-and-coming producer Pascal Gabriel to work on a couple of tracks. One of the label's complaints about the album as the band originally submitted it was that they felt it lacked a potential hit single, so Gabriel produced a new song ("Come on Now") that the band had written after the rest of the album had already been recorded; Gabriel also remixed two of the album's other tracks (the opener "Sand on Fire" and first single "Now It's Time to Say Goodbye"). Although the band admitted that they enjoyed working with Gabriel, the changes did nothing to help the album's dismal sales. By the end of 1995, both A&M and OLI had dropped the band.
Following the album's release, the band shortened their name to Kitchens O.D. and recorded and released the non-album single "Feel My Genie"/"To Love a Star" in May 1996 before calling it quits.

[[Hexanite]]

CATEGORIES: Explosives

Hexanite was a castable German military explosive developed early in the 20th century before the First World War for the Kaiserliche Marine, intended to augment supplies of trinitrotoluene (TNT), which were then in short supply. Hexanite is significantly more powerful than TNT on its own.[tpl]Fact|date=October 2008[/tpl]  The most common hexanite formula (by weight) was 60% TNT and 40% hexanitrodiphenylamine.
Typically, hexanite was used in underwater naval weapons e.g. warheads for the G7a and G7e series torpedoes http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTGER_WWII.htmhttp://www.dutchsubmarines.com/specials/special_torpedoes_mines.htm and the 300 kilogram main explosive charge in aluminium-cased http://www.lhg.is/english/eod/ buoyant, moored "EMF" magnetic mines capable of being laid by U-boats in 200, 300 or 500 metres of water.http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WAMGER_Mines.htm http://www.lhg.is/english/eod/mines/
This explosive is regarded as obsolete, so any hexanite-filled munitions encountered will be in the form of unexploded ordnance dating from the Second World War.
The Japanese used this in World War II as explosive compound type 97 & 98. http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/WDR/WDR58/WDR58-3.html#cn9

Wild Wild World is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in the Merrie Melodies series in 1960 and directed by Robert McKimson.  It's a parody of the television series Wide Wide World hosted by Dave Garroway.  In this cartoon, "Cave Darroway" presents a recently discovered film taken during the Cro-Magnon era.  The stone age gags in the "film" predate and possibly inspired The Flintstones which made its debut in 1960. The final gag in this cartoon depicts a modern elevator utilizing the primitive operational methods of the stone age elevator shown in the "film."  Because of the long lead time in producing an animated cartoon, the TV program which inspired this cartoon had already been canceled when this cartoon was released.  This cartoon is available on DVD as a bonus short on disc four of Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6.
The documentary was filmed in the "Geo-Goshical Year 75,000,000 B.C." (satirizing the International Geophysical Year 1957-'58), in breathtaking Cromagnonscope.  Cromagnonscope last appeared in the cartoon Pre-Hysterical Hare.

[[Flaser bed]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary structures

Flaser beds are a sedimentary bedding pattern created when a sediment is exposed to intermittent flows, leading to alternating sand and mud layers.  While flaser beds typically form in tidal environments, they can (rarely) form in fluvial conditions - on point bars or in ephemeral streams. Individual sand ripples are created, which are later infilled by mud during quieter flow periods. These mud drapes are typically a minor constituent of the deposit; they can consolidate within three hours, protecting the underlying layer from erosion. Flaser bedding typically forms in high-energy environments.[tpl]cite web|title=Tidal deposits|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Course/geosci697/tidal/tidal-deposits.html|author=Tom Bellile |date=2003-10-23[/tpl] (with photograph)

[[Army of the Var]]

CATEGORIES: Armées of the French First Republic

The Army of the Var (Armée du Var) was one of the French Revolutionary armies.  It was established along the River Var, the frontier between France and Piedmont, and charged with protecting Provence from invasion.
In reality its name was not official.  It came about when general Jacques Bernard d'Anselme, was charged with commanding a corps from the armée du Midi which had gathered at the Var.  Seeking independence from general de Montesquiou, to whom he had been subordinated, d'Anselme unilaterally named his corps the Armée du Var on 29 September 1792.  Despite this, it was really only the right wing of the armée du Midi, and only became the armée d'Italie on 7 November 1792 by a decree of the Conseil exécutif dated the 1st.  His name nevertheless figures on the Arc de triomphe.
At the end of 1792 d'Anselme crossed the river and took Nice practically without a battle, and so the armée du Var annexed the county of Nice to France and took this as its base.

[[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]]

CATEGORIES: Economic history of Argentina, Presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, 2008 in Argentina, Agriculture in Argentina

The '2008 Argentine Farm Crisis refers to the conflict between the Argentinean national government and the 4 entities that represented the agriculture sector.The crisis began in March 2008 with four agricultural sector employers organizations taking direct action such as road blocks to protest against the decision of the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to raise export taxes on soybeans and sunflower. The subsequent political upheaval has seen elements of the ruling Front for Victory speak out against the government and the resignation of Economy Minister Martín Lousteau.
In March 2008, Fernández de Kirchner's government introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, effectively raising levies on soybean exports to 44 percent from 35 percent at the time of the announcement.[ref]
[tpl]cite web|title= Argentine Soybean Output May Slip; Protests May Pause|publisher=Bloomberg|date=9 March 2008|url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aXApGun1Lmpw| accessdate= 29 April 2008 [/tpl][/ref]
The aim was to raise government funds for social investment by increasing the government's share of returns from rising world grain prices, and also to reduce domestic food prices by encouraging farmers to switch to growing staple foods like wheat and corn, rather than export crops such as soybeans. Farmers, on the other hand, felt that the export duties were already too high.[tpl]cite news|title= Argentina ends grain tax hike |work=Los Angeles Times |date=19 July 2008 |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-farmers19-2008jul19,0,2489386.story |first=Patrick J. |last=McDonnell| accessdate= 19 July 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080803120812/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-farmers19-2008jul19,0,2489386.story| archivedate= 3 August 2008| deadurl= no[/tpl]  The move led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, starting on March 11, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on the new taxation scheme. As a result, on March 25 thousands of demonstrators banging pots massed around the obelisk in the capital and in front of the presidential palace. Protests extended across the country. In Buenos Aires, hours after Fernández attacked farmers for their two-week strike and "abundant" profits, there were violent incidents between government supporters and protesters, and the police was accused of wilfully turning a blind eye.
The media was harshly critical of Luis D'Elía, a former government official who took part in the incidents, with some media sources and members of the opposition (notably Elisa Carrió), claiming that he and his followers had violently suppressed the protest pursuant to the government's orders.[ref]

[/ref]
On April 1, the government organised a rally during which thousands of pro-government protesters marched through downtown Buenos Aires in support of the Argentine leadership. Fernández called on farmers to act "as part of a country, not as owners of a country".
A poll-result published in the Spanish newspaper El País (Spain's most widely circulated daily newspaper) revealed that, following the protests, Fernández's approval rating had "plummeted" from 57.8% at the start of her administration [ref]

Because of the farmers' strikes, mass protests and road blocks in various parts of the country, President Cristina Kirchner was forced to send the government's farm exports tax proposal to the Argentine Congress. On July 5, the Argentine lower house narrowly approved the government's tax package on agricultural exports by a vote of 129-122.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7491725.stm | work=BBC News | title=Argentine MPs approve farm taxes | date=2008-07-05 | accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl]
However, in the early morning of July 17, after seventeen hours of tense debate, the Argentine Senate rejected the government's grain exports tax measure by a vote of 37-36, with Vice-President Julio Cobos casting the decisive, tie-breaking vote against the measure.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/world/americas/18argentina.html |title=Argentina Blocks Farm Export Tax| work=The New York Times| accessdate= 26 May 2013[/tpl] With the defeat of the farm exports tax bill in the Senate, it is expected that the four-month confrontation between the Kirchner administration and the agricultural sector over farm export levies will come to an expedient (if only temporary) end.
On July 18, the Argentine government officially revoked Resolution 125. Levies on agricultural exports returned to March 10 levels (i.e. before the controversial Resolution 125 was imposed by a presidential decree).Derogaron la polémica resolución 125

[[Army of the Western Pyrenees]]

CATEGORIES: Armées of the French First Republic

The Army of the western Pyrenees (Armée des Pyrénées occidentales) was one of the French armies of the French Revolutionary Wars. From April 1793 until 12 October 1795, the army fought in the Basque Country and in Navarre during the War of the Pyrenees. After indecisive fighting during the first year of its existence, the army seized the Spanish port of San Sebastián in August 1794. By the time the Peace of Basel was signed on 22 July 1795, the Army of the western Pyrenees captured significant portions of northeastern Spain.
The army commanders with the longest tenure were Jacques Léonard Muller, who served from October 1793 to August 1794, and Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey, who served from August 1794 until the army was disbanded. Emperor Napoleon I appointed Moncey a Marshal of France in 1804 during the First French Empire.

[[Château de Mérens]]

CATEGORIES: Castles in Midi-Pyrénées, Official historical monuments of France, Gers

The Château de Mérens is a castle in the commune of Mérens in the Gers département of France.
Construction of the castle dates from the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th centuries. It was altered in the early 17th century.
The hub of the castle corresponds to the original Gascon structure; the south west square tower belongs to this period of construction. At the start of the 17th century, the castle was furnished with a new system of defence, including a round walk. At the same time, windows were added and the internal layout altered. In the west elements of the medieaval enceinte can be seen in the wine cellar. Works carried out between 1604 and 1613 concentrated on providing windows and on doubling the height of the east façade
The castle was later converted for agricultural use.
It has been listed since 2003 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

[[Army of the Eastern Pyrenees]]
CATEGORIES: Armées of the French First Republic

The Army of the Eastern Pyrenees (Armée des Pyrénées orientales) was one of the French Revolutionary armies. It fought against the Kingdom of Spain in Rousillon and Catalonia during the War of the Pyrenees. The army was formed a few days after Spain invaded France in April 1793. The Peace of Basel on 22 July 1795 ended the fighting and the army was dissolved on 12 October that same year. 
After a dismal first year of fighting, the army's fortunes improved and it started to win victories. Its successes, together with the victories won by the Army of the Western Pyrenees, forced Spain to sue for peace. The war took a severe toll on the commanders of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. One general died in battle, at least three were executed by the Committee of Public Safety, and one was arrested and released but later died of disease at the front.

[[Weather testing of polymers]]
CATEGORIES: Polymers, Materials degradation, Tests

Weather testing of polymers is the controlled polymer degradation and polymer coating degradation under lab or natural conditions.
Just like erosion of rocks, natural phenomena can cause degradation in polymer systems. The elements of most concern to polymers are Ultraviolet radiation, moisture and humidity, high temperatures and temperature fluctuations. Polymers are used in every day life, so it is important for scientists and polymer producers to understand durability and expected lifespan of polymer products. Paint, a common polymer coating, is used to change the colour, change the reflectance (gloss), as well as forming a protective coating. The structure of paint consists of pigments in a matrix of resin.
A typical example is painted steel roofing and walling products, which are constantly exposed to harmful weathering conditions.

The Château de Lacassagne is a castle in the commune of Saint-Avit-Frandat  in the Gers département of France.
The Château de Lacassagne is thought to date from the latter half of the 15th century, with additions and alterations made in every century until the 19th. It originated as an ancient salle (hall) and was altered in the 15th century with the addition of a spiral staircase and windows.
A residence was added in the 17th century. On the first floor, in a room known as the Salle des Chevaliers de Malte, the painted decor was done between 1620 and 1640 for Jean Bertrand de Luppé, prior of St Gilles, and intended as a replica of the grand council hall of the Knights of St John of Malta. Among the pictures are copies of Matteo da Leccio's paintings representing  the attack on Valletta by the Turks in 1565. (The originals were in the council chamber of the Grandmaster's Palace in Malta and were destroyed in 1798).
In the 18th century, a west wing was added to the main building.
The Château de Lacassagne has been listed since 1980 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. It is open to the public.

Calfucurá also known as Juan Calfucurá or Cufulcurá (b. late 1770s; d. 1873), was a leading Mapuche lonco and military figure in Patagonia in the 19th century. He crossed the Andes from Chile to the Pampas around 1830 after a call from the governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, to fight the Boroanos tribe. Calfucurá succeeded in ending the military power of the Boroanos when he massacred a large part of them in 1834 during a meeting for trade.
In 1859 he attacked Bahía Blanca in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. 
The decision of planning and executing the Conquest of the Desert was probably triggered by the 1872 assault of Calfucurá and his 6,000 followers on the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio, where 300 criollos were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken.

[[Manchester Poetry Prize]]
CATEGORIES: Awards established in 2008, Culture in Manchester, British poetry awards

The Manchester Poetry Prize is a literary award celebrating excellence in creative writing. It was launched by Carol Ann Duffy and The Manchester Writing School at Manchester Metropolitan University in 2008, and was the first phase of the annual Manchester Writing Competition.
Open internationally to writers aged 16 or over, the Manchester Poetry Prize awards a cash prize of £10,000 to the writer of the best portfolio of poems submitted. In addition, during the 2008 and 2010 Prizes, a bursary for study at MMU (or cash equivalent) was awarded to an entrant aged 18–25 as part of the Jeffrey Wainwright Manchester Young Writer of the Year Award. Entrants are asked to submit a portfolio of poetry (three to five poems; the total length of the portfolio should not exceed 120 lines). The poems can be on any subject but must be new work, not published elsewhere (in print, or online).
By the closing date of 1 August, the 2008 Manchester Poetry Prize had attracted 1,137 entries (almost 4,700 poems) from over 30 countries. The 2008 competition was judged by duffy with poets Gillian Clarke and Imtiaz Dharker completing the panel. They short-listed six finalists, and the winners were announced at a gala prize-giving ceremony held on Thursday 16 October 2008 at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester - an event which officially opened the 2008 Manchester Literature Festival, and featured readings from the judges and all six short-listed entrants. The evening was hosted by James Draper from the Manchester Writing School and featured welcome speeches from the Manchester Literature Festival's Matthew Frost and Rosa Battle from Manchester City Council (representing the Lord Mayor's Office).  
The joint winners, Lesley Saunders and Mandy Coe, impressed the judges with their contrasting but brilliant styles and shared the £10,000 Prize. Helen Mort, 23, from Sheffield, won the Manchester Young Writer of the Year Award. The runners up were Mike Barlow, Allison McVety and Rosie Shepperd. 
The Manchester Writing School launched the second Manchester Poetry Prize in 2010 with Simon Armitage, Lavinia Greenlaw and Daljit Nagra as judges. The competition closed on 6 August having received more than 1,000 portfolios (almost 4,000 poerms). The award ceremony again formed part of the Manchester Literature Festival and was a gala dinner held at Manchester Metropolitan University, hosted by James Draper and Matthew Frost (this time working as a humorous double act) with music from the Gavin Barras Duo and readings from the judges and six finalists. 
Armitage gave a speech before announcing the winners: 
"A question often asked when poetry has one of its brief moments in the spotlight is, 'How is poetry doing? What kind of state is it in? Is it in good health?' And the answer I tend to give is that it is as well as it ever was and no worse than it will ever be. Poetry is not popular. Popular culture is popular. Pop music is popular. Popcorn is popular. Poetry isn't popular. If it were, it wouldn't be poetry. It isn't dormant or dead, or even having a little nap. Poetry is awake, alive, alert, doing its own thing, available to all, attractive to the few, beholden to none. Wherever we find the hot air of politics and the blunt instrument of dogma and the double-speak of the marketplace and the silver tongue of the media, we'll also find poetry – a small but endlessly dense counterweight to all that guff. So, ask me how poetry is doing and that's what I'll usually say. But ask me after judging the Manchester Poetry Prize and I'll say it seems to be in very good health indeed. Prizes and poetry aren't obvious bed-mates. Prizes really belong to the world of game-shows and sport. But if they must exist, then they should be meaningful and they should be credible. The Manchester Poetry Prize is certainly significant; it's one of the biggest in the country already. And in terms of being honourable, asking for anonymous entries ensures that reputations and allegiances don't enter the equation. Also asking for a batch of poems rather than a single entry allows judges to look beyond competency and control in writing and to reward other virtues, such as risk-taking, inventiveness and sustained achievement. There was, throughout the entries, plenty of that on display."http://www.manchesterwritingcompetition.co.uk/poetry/winners_speech.php
The winner of the £10,000 first prize was Judy Brown. Michelle Kern from New York won the Jeffrey Wainwright Manchester Young Writer of the Year Award. The runners up were John Wedgwood Clarke, Clive McWilliam, Lesley Saunders (who won in 2008) and Jack Underwood. 
The Manchester Writing School launched the first Manchester Fiction Prize in 2009, with Nicholas Royle as Head Judge, joined by Sarah Hall and M. John Harrison; the School launched a second Fiction Prize in 2011, with Royle chairing the panel for a second time, joined by Heather Beck, John Burnside and Alison MacLeod. A third Manchester Poetry Prize  followed in 2012, and while the £10,000 main prize will remain, the Young Writer bursary element was be dropped. In 2013, the Prize became an annual event and a Manchester Writing for Children Competition (Poetry) was launched, with judges Mandy Coe, Imtiaz Dharker and Philip Gross.

Today's digital cameras and camcorders include high-resolution optics, compact size, automatic time and date stamps, good battery life, shutters to freeze motion, and computers to autofocus and eliminate jitter using image stabilization.Palangio, Tom C. in the article "Digital Image Analysis" Featured in The Journal of Explosives Engineering Volume 26, Number 1

Theories on the causes of poverty are the foundation upon which poverty reduction strategies are based.
While in developed nations poverty is often seen as either a personal or a structural defect, in developing nations the issue of poverty is more profound due to the lack of governmental funds. Some theories on poverty in the developing world focus on cultural characteristics as a retardant of further development. Other theories focus on social and political aspects that perpetuate poverty; perceptions of the poor have a significant impact on the design and execution of programs to alleviate poverty.

Their initial project focused on modelling a 1998 Brazilian food-poisoning incident involving 8,000 injuries and 16 deaths.
Blast casualty prediction is routinely performed in the planning of military operations.  For example, a cruise missile attack was considered by the United States in 1998 for Tarnak Farms in order to kill Osama bin Laden. However, not enough was known about the collateral damage effects of cruise missiles on mud huts.   At the time there were estimated to be 100 women and children in the area, and in order to spare these civilians, the attack was not approved.Ghost Wars

[[Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh]]
CATEGORIES: Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh, Health in Bangladesh

This article has last been updated in 2012. Please feel free to update it further, if need be.
Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh is characterized by a number of achievements and challenges. The share of the population with access to an improved water source was estimated at 98% in 2004, a very high level for a low-income country. This has been achieved to a large extent through the construction of handpumps with the support of external donors. However, in 1993 it was discovered that groundwater, the source of drinking water for 97% of the rural population and a significant share of the urban population, is in many cases naturally contaminated with arsenic. It gradually emerged that 70 million people drank water which exceeds the WHO guidelines of 10 microgram of arsenic per liter, and 30 million drank water containing more than the Bangladesh National Standard of 50 microgram per liter, leading to chronic arsenic poisoning.[ref]
</ref> On the other hand, surface water is usually polluted and requires treatment.<ref name="Das Gupta 389">
, p. 389</ref> Taking arsenic contamination into account, it was estimated that in 2004 still 74% of the population had access to arsenic-free drinking water. Another challenge is the low level of cost recovery due to low tariffs and poor [[economic efficiency]], especially in urban areas where revenues from water sales do not even cover operating costs. In rural areas, users contribute 34% of investment costs,<ref name="Danish Evaluation"/> and at least in piped water schemes supported by the [[Rural Development Academy]] recover operating costs.
Sanitation faces its own set of challenges, with only 56% of the population estimated to have had access to adequate sanitation facilities in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=CIA World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 September 2013[/tpl] A new approach to improve sanitation coverage in rural areas, the community-led total sanitation concept that has been first introduced in Bangladesh, is credited for having contributed significantly to the increase in sanitation coverage since 2000.[ref]
</ref>
The government has adopted a number of policies to remedy the challenges in the sector, including National Policies for Safe Water Supply and Sanitation, both of 1998, a National Water Policy of 1999, a National Water Management Plan, and a National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation, both of 2004, as well as a National Sanitation Strategy of 2005. Among others, these policies emphasize decentralization, user participation, the role of women, and "appropriate pricing rules". The Arsenic Mitigation Policy gives "preference to surface water over groundwater". At the operational level, there has also been a conceptual shift from single-use of water - such as through handpumps for drinking water and motorized deep tubewells for irrigation - to multiple use of water from deep tubewells since the 1990s.

Side windows can be either fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered as an extension of the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.
Today most cars use laminated glass as it does not shatter in sharp pieces and so does not harm the driver and passengers.

[tpl]Refimprove|date=December 2011[/tpl][tpl]More footnotes|date=December 2011[/tpl]

Dagobert David Runes (January 6, 1902 – September 24, 1982) was a philosopher and author. Born in Zastavna, Bukovina, Austro-Hungary (now in Ukraine), he emigrated to the United States in 1926.  He had received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Vienna in 1924.  In the U.S. he became editor of The Modern Thinker and later Current Digest. From 1931 to 1934 he was Director of the Institute for Advanced Education in New York City. He had an encyclopedic level fluency in Latin and Biblical Hebrew; he fluently spoke and wrote in Austrian German, German, Yiddish, French, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, Czechoslovakian, and English. In 1941 he founded the Philosophical Library,[tpl]cite news|title=Dr. Dagobert Runes, Founder Of the Philosophical Library|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/27/obituaries/dr-dagobert-runes-founder-of-the-philosophical-library.html|accessdate=15 December 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 September 1982|page=D-9[/tpl]  a spiritual organization and publishing house. Runes was a colleague and friend to Albert Einstein.Einstein wrote quotes for the covers of many of his works, including one on his book The War Against The Jews front inner flap "His views are the closest to mine... the historical treatment of Jews by Christians is the most egregious example of man's inhumanity to their fellow man..."
Runes published an English translation of Marx's On the Jewish Question under the title A World without Jews. Though this has often been considered the first translation of the work, a Soviet anti-zionist, propaganda version had existed a few years earlier, which was likely unknown to Runes.  As the title of Rune's book sounded antisemitic, it had extremely limited circulation in the English-speaking world. Runes wrote an introduction to the translation that was clearly antagonistic to extreme Marxism, and 'its materialism,' as he would later often put it, yet he did not entirely negate Marxism. He also edited several works presenting the ideas and history of philosophy to a general audience, especially his Dictionary of Philosophy.
He spoke and wrote unpublished letters about his extensive research into the censorship by the Vatican and other Christian organizations of Jewish history, which as he studied he realized was far more prolific than almost anyone realized.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Early versions of the Nicene Creed, for example, instituted laws such as "You shall apply all negative to that pernicious race Jews, and all positive will be applied to the poor of the Roman Christians";[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] and Justinian I banned any Jewish language, which is rarely noted. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] The extensive antisemitism in the Theodosian Code was later censored in some works. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Jews were barred from many fields which did not fit into the stereotypes portrayed in annual Good Friday passion plays, such as being tax collectors or money traders. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] (Another minor example was that in medieval Sweden, Jews were only allowed to trade used clothes, so that their social status would remain beneath the Christians). [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] He also listed holidays where young energetic parishioners were directed to strike the first elderly Jews they saw upon leaving the Church, specifically in the nose, where blood would be readily observed. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Runes' love for the Latin language greatly facilitated this research.  
Dagobert Runes moved to the United States with his wife Mary Gronich-Runes. They remarried in NYC in 1929 and remained married until Mary's death. They had two children, Regeen and Richard.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] His mother was murdered in an anti-Semitic riot following the Holocaust;[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] almost his entire family and their circle of friends were killed in the Holocaust.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Louis Saint-Calibre (born July 6, 1912) was a French bobsledder who competed in the late 1940s. At the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, he finished 12th in the two-man event as well as 13th in the four-man event.
Four years later he finished eleventh in the four-man event at the 1952 Winter Olympics.
Saint-Calibre later was involved in the unsuccessful design for the bobsleigh course to be used for the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, specifically with costs related to the course itself (USD300,000) instead of the course and its supporting area (grandstands, scoreboard, lighting, tramway, etc. which raised the cost to USD700,000). A letter of protest was sent from the 1960 Organizing Committee to the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in late 1957 that was published in the February 1958 Olympic Review. This issue would lead to bobsleigh's exclusion from the 1960 program.

[[Oliver Castle]]
CATEGORIES: Peel towers in the Scottish Borders, Castles in the Scottish Borders, Former castles in Scotland

Oliver Castle was a small tower house, located in the upper Tweed Valley in the Scottish Borders, within the bounds of the village of Tweedsmuir. The castle was originally part of the line of peel towers along the Tweed Valley. It was replaced in the seventeenth century by a house on the same site, and in the 18th century by a house on lower ground. For most of its existence the property has been owned by members of the Tweedie family.
The castle was originally associated with Clan Fraser, and was perhaps named for Oliver Fraser, who gave lands to Newbattle Abbey as recorded in its register. The lines of descent from Oliver and his nephew Adam are uncertain, but the Frasers continued to exert power from Oliver Castle with Sir Bernard Fraser and Sir Gilbert Fraser, who held in turn the hereditary office of Sheriff of Tweeddale. A descendant, Sir Simon Fraser of Oliver and Neidpath, Knight Banneret, fought in the Wars of Scottish Independence. Clan Tweedie was a sept of Clan Fraser[tpl]efn|The Tweedies intermarried with the Frasers, the Stewarts, the Douglas and many other prominent Scottish families. Their own sense of dignity was such that they ignored summonses from the King. Conversely, King James V of Scotland famously invited himself to a Tweedie wedding. The Tweedies at first supported Oliver Cromwell - a distant relation of theirs - but rejected the Puritan laws against such harmless and enjoyable activities as song and dance; in a later generation, they supported Bonnie Prince Charlie.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] [/tpl] and by this time the Tweedies had already taken over the Fraser title to Drumelzier. In the 14th century, William Tweedie, a younger son of James and Katherine Tweedie of Drumelzier, obtained the lands of Oliver from the preceptor of Torphichen.
The legendary lawlessness of the Scottish Marches revolved around bitter inter-family feuds and conflict over livestock. In an incident characteristic of the times, Thomas Porteus of the adjacent Hawkshaw was arraigned on the 16th February 1489 for having lifted seventy-four lambs from the lands of Oliver Castle, belonging to William Tweedie and Lawrence Tweedie
The Castle of Oliver was on very high ground, [tpl]convert|1000|ft[/tpl] above sea level, and by the late 1640s was in a ruinous state and past all repair.  Patrick Tweedie decided to replace it, building a new house at Oliver in 1649, when the family moved from Oliver Castle itself. Later on, about 1731 or 1734, another house appears to have been built at or near the site of the present house of Oliver, and in 1786, Thomas Tweedie of Oliver built the current house there.

[[Prostitution in Indonesia]]

CATEGORIES: Prostitution by country, Indonesian society, Prostitution in Indonesia

Prostitution in Indonesia is legally considered a "crime against decency/morality", although it is widely practiced, tolerated and regulated. Some women are financially motivated to become prostitutes, while others may be forced by friends, relatives or strangers. Traditionally, they have met with customers in entertainment venues or special prostitution complexes, or lokalisasi. There are 4 (four) types of prostitution in Indonesia: (a) Prostitutes who come from particular areas, (b) prostitution in their workpalce. (c) prostitution and life style, and (d) prostitution and the ritual beliefs (Koentjoro, 2011). However, recently internet forums and Facebook have been used to facilitate prostitute-client relations. Approximately 30 percent of prostitutes in Indonesia are children, and child sex tourism has become an issue at the resort islands of Batam and Bali.

[[Chester Zardis]]
CATEGORIES: 1900 births, 1990 deaths, American jazz double-bassists, Jazz musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana

Chester Zardis (May 27, 1900, New Orleans - August 14, 1990, New Orleans) was an American jazz double-bassist.
Zardis played bass from a young age, and studied under Billy Marrero of the Superior Orchestra. In his teens he was involved in a fistfight at a New Orleans theater, which resulted in his being sent to the Jones Waif Home. While there he began playing with another of the Home's residents, Louis Armstrong. He joined Buddy Petit's orchestra at age 16, and worked as a bassist in nightclubs and a tubist in brass bands in New Orleans in the 1920s, playing with Kid Rena, A.J. Piron, Punch Miller, Kid Howard, Jack Carey, Fate Marable, and Duke Dejan's Dixie Rhythm Band.
He was given the nickname "Little Bear" by Fats Pichon, a bandleader with whom Zardis played on the riverboat S.S. Capital in the 1930s. During that decade he also played with Count Basie in New York City, and recorded with George Lewis and Bunk Johnson. During the Second World War Zardis served in the Army, then worked briefly as a sheriff in the Western United States. Upon his return to New Orleans he played with Andy Anderson, but quit music between 1954 and 1964. Zardis worked as a Jailer in Jefferson Parish for several years.
When he returned to active performance, Zardis played often at Preservation Hall with Lewis and Percy Humphrey among many others. He continued to be a fixture of the New Orleans jazz scene up until his death in 1990, including several international tours. 
Zardis was a master of the original New Orleans - style slap bass, achieving both clarity of intonation and a strong perrcussive beat.  His skill placed him easily on a par with better known New Orleans slap bassists of his era like Pops Foster and Wellman Braud. Unlike Foster and Braud, however, Zardis remained in his home-town throughout his playing career and consequently was not as widely recorded or appreciated.  Playing un-amplified string bass using gut strings in large halls or rooms with quIrky acoustics posed significant challenges to New Orleans bassists.  The short-statured Zardis, who was a powerful player and a creative soloist, overcame these handicaps by frequently turning his back to the audience in order to face his instrument into the back wall of the bandstand, thus bouncing his notes off the wall, and projecting his sound up and over the competing sounds of the louder front-line brass horn players and out over a room full of loud patrons.  He employed this simple trick night after night during his years performing at Preservation Hall on St. Peter Street in the French Quarter.
Zardis was regularly featured in documentaries; he is himself the subject of three of them, Liberty Street Blues, Chester Zardis: Spirit of New Orleans, and Three Men of Jazz.

"San Antonio Rose"/"New San Antonio Rose" was the signature song of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. "San Antonio Rose" was an instrumental song written by Bob Wills, who first recorded it with the Playboys in 1938. Band members added lyrics and it was retitled "New San Antonio Rose".Boyd, Jazz of the Southwest, p. 20: "Among the Playboy's all-time greates hits were two that featured horns: 'New San Antonio Rose,' a Wills tune with lyrics added by several band members, ..." The song opens with the refrain:
The song is written in the first person with the Rose of San Antone being the gentleman's lost love.
The most successful recording was made by Bing Crosby with Bob Crosby and the Bob Cats in 1940 - over a million copies were sold for which Bing was awarded a gold disc.
"New San Antonio Rose" was the first national hit by Bob Wills and His Playboys, propelling them from their Southwestern fame to national notice.Wolff, Country Music, "Big Balls in Cowtown: Western Swing From Fort Worth to Fresno", p. 94: "One of the key turning points was 'New San Antonio Rose,' the Playboys' first national hit. The record sold over a million and was a jukebox favorite."Dorman, It Happened in Oklahoma, p. 84: "The popularity of the Texas Playboys only grew throughout the Tulsa years, culminating in their 1940 recording of the song, 'New San Antonio Rose.' The song was their first big hit, extending their appeal from the Southwest to fans nationwide and earning a gold record."
The song, both the music and lyrics, reflects the Mexican influence Bob Wills found growing up in the Southwest.La Chapelle, Proud to Be an Okie, p. 94: "Influenced by his early exposure to Mexican fiddle practices, Bob Wills introduced a mariachi chorus into his signature 'New San Antonio Rose' performing it and a few Spanish-language songs to spillover crowds while in Los Angeles." Wills developed the melody of the original "San Antonio Rose" itself from a traditional tune, "Spanish Two Step", by the playing the bridge in reverse.McWhorter, Cowboy Fiddler, p. 60: "The Colonel Sutherland went back in the control room and the boys asked Bob what they were going to do. Bob Wills said, "I don't have any idea. I'm going to play the bridge of 'The Spanish Two-Step' backwards, and Leon McAuliffe, when I get through, you do anything you want to do and let's get out of here'. The played it through for a time and the Colonel came running out of there with his eyes wide open, said, 'Bob, what do you call that tune?' Bob said, 'You know, we haven't named it. We were going to let you name it. This tune's especially for you and you can name it anything you want to.' He said, 'I'm going to call it 'San Antonio Rose'.' "
"New San Antonio Rose" ruffled the feathers of Southern country music moguls when Wills and the Playboys performed it with horns and a drum at the Grand Ole Opry on December 30, 1944.Kienzle, Southwest Shuffle, p. 256: " 'He Dave Macon abut flipped his dipper,' Mountjoy explained. 'We were breaking' tradition and all that. He went by a couple of time mumblin' about 'God-damn young upstarts'; and 'What they doin' with those drums here?' ' "Kienzle, Southwest Shuffle,P. 257: "When Acuff finished the introduction, the Playboys snapped into 'New San Antonio Rose,' Montjoy's drums and Brashear's trumpet clearly visible to the audience. ... 'They couldn't get the people to quit applauding; they just kept on and on and on. They kept tryin' to quiet the crowd down, and they wouldn't quiet down.' That kind of response usually justifies an encore. But Wills had remorselessly flouted Opry tradition, first by the act of bringing a drummer, then by defying their request that Mountjoy stay concealed. ... There would be no encore. But no one forgot, either."

A human-powered hydrofoil is a small hydrofoil watercraft propelled entirely by the muscle power of its operator(s). Human-powered hydrofoils may be driven by pedals, as in a hydrocycle, by paddles, as in a Flyak, or by bouncing, to use flapping wing propulsion. Hydrofoils are the fastest water-based vehicles propelled solely by human power.  They can reach speeds of up to [tpl]convert|34|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on[/tpl], easily exceeding the world records set by competitive rowing which stand at about [tpl]convert|20|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on[/tpl]. This speed advantage is achieved since hydrofoils lack a submerged body to provide buoyancy, greatly reducing the drag force.

The film, a parody of 1970s pornography, follows a sexual encounter between two men dressed up in furry costumes who copulate in a variety of positions until the final shot of ejaculation.  In his review for nytheatre.com, Martin Denton called the film "quite apt, with its soundtracklessness making it feel both subversive and seedy at the same time)"FRIGID Festival 2008 Reviews

Hazit HaAm ([tpl]lang-he|חזית העם[/tpl], lit. Front of the People) was a newspaper associated with Revisionist Zionism published in Palestine between 1931 and 1934.
The paper was established in 1931 by Yehoshua Lichter. It closed in 1934, and was succeeded by HaYarden and HaMashkif.
The newspaper is noted for its tolerant or even supportive attitude towards some aspects of Nazi ideology. When Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, it stated that "If some segments of our people draw the appropriate conclusions from the Hitlerism sic, then we will be able to say that something good came out of a bad situation." The newspaper also approved of Hitler's anti-communism, stating that "the anti-Semitic husk should be discarded, but not its anti-Marxist inside." The praise of Nazism reportedly stopped after leading Revisionist thinker Ze'ev Jabotinsky called for "a total end to this abomination."When the first draft of history fails the test of time Haaretz, 29 April 2008

Triplemanía, is the biggest annual professional show professional wrestling event promoted by the Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) promotion and is traditionally held in May or June each year, commemorating the anniversary of the foundation of AAA. A majority of the shows have been presented as pay-per-view events, with only a few being shown as Television specials on the Televisa channel. The Triplemanía show features culminations of long building storylines, usually ending at Triplemanía. Some years Triplemanía was not a single show, but a series of shows - either two or three per year, but in recent years it has been a single show. The show has been promoted for 20 years, with 27 shows in total under the Triplemanía banner. The name is a combination of how "AAA" is pronounced in Spanish, "Triple A" and WrestleMania, WWE's biggest annual show. The latest event, Triplemanía XXI, took place on June 16, 2013, at the Mexico City Arena in México City, México.

[[Creaming (chemistry)]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical mixtures, Colloidal chemistry

Creaming, in the laboratory sense, is the migration of the dispersed phase of an emulsion, under the influence of buoyancy. The particles float upwards or sink, depending on how large they are and how much less dense or more dense they may be than the continuous phase, and also how viscous or how thixotropic the continuous phase might be. For as long as the particles remain separated, the process is called creaming. 
Where it is important that either the form or the concentration of the emulsion should be stable, it is desirable that the continuous and the dispersed phases should have similar densities, and it also is desirable that the continuous phase should be viscous or thixotropic. Thixotropy is particularly valuable in paints, sauces, and similar products, partly because it counteracts tendencies towards creaming. It also is important that the particles be as small as practicable because that reduces their tendency to migrate under the influence of buoyant forces. The electric charges on their surfaces should preferably tend to be uniform, so that the particles repel rather than attract each other.  
Creaming is usually seen as undesirable because it causes difficulties in storage and handling, but it can be useful in special cases, especially where it is desirable to concentrate an emulsion. A particular example is in the separation of dairy cream, either to achieve a desired concentration of butterfat, or to make butter. 
Depending on whether the dispersed particles are less dense or more dense than the continuous phase, they may move either to the top of a sample, or to the bottom. As already stated, the process of migration is called creaming while the particles of the substance remain separated. In this it differs ideally from flocculation (where particles clump) or emulsion breaking (where particles coalesce). One important difference between creaming and the other two processes; unlike flocculation and breaking, creaming of an emulsion is largely a simple process to reverse.

The Baltimore Steam Packet Company, nicknamed the [tpl]nowrap|Old Bay Line[/tpl], was an American steamship line from 1840 to 1962 that provided overnight steamboat service on the Chesapeake Bay, primarily between Baltimore, Maryland, and Norfolk, Virginia. Called a "packet" for the mail packets carried on government mail contracts, the term in the 19th century came to mean a steamer line operating on a regular, fixed daily schedule between two or more cities. When it closed in 1962 after 122 years of existence, it was the last surviving overnight steamship passenger service in the United States.[tpl]cite news |title=A Steam Packet Ending Its Runs |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 8, 1962 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Alexander Crosby Brown |title=Steam Packets on the Chesapeake |publisher=Cornell Maritime Press |location=Cambridge, Maryland |year=1961 |page=viii–xiii |lccn=61012580[/tpl]
In addition to regularly calling on Baltimore and Norfolk, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company at various times provided freight, passenger and vehicle transport to Washington, D.C., Old Point Comfort, and Richmond, Virginia. The Old Bay Line, as it came to be known by the 1860s, was acclaimed for its genteel service and fine dining, serving Chesapeake Bay specialties. Walter Lord, famed author of A Night to Remember (and whose grandfather had been the packet line's president from 1893 to 1899), mused that its reputation for excellent service was attributable to "... some magical blending of the best in the North and the South, made possible by the Company's unique role in 'bridging' the two sections ... the North contributed its tradition of mechanical proficiency, making the ships so reliable; while the South contributed its gracious ease".
One of the Old Bay Line's steamers, the former President Warfield, later became famous as the Exodus ship of book and movie fame, when Jewish refugees from war-torn Europe sailed aboard her in 1947 in an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to Palestine.

There has been extensive scholarship investigating the difference in usage of prithee as opposed to pray you, both in terms of politeness and grammaticalisation.[tpl]Cite book|title=Variation Past and Present: VARIENG Studies on English for Terttu Nevalainen|author=Helena Raumolin-Brunberg|publisher=Société Néophilologique|year=2002|page=146|isbn=951-9040-16-1|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=niRZAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] Because prithee eventually came to be used in the same context with the word you, it is considered to have developed into a monomorpheme. Prithee was almost always used as a parenthesis in order to introduce indirect questions and requests. 
Prithee and pray you often coincide in Early Modern English texts, and the difference between the two terms has been debated by scholars. Scholars such as Roger Brown and Albert Gilman have suggested that prithee was an ingroup indicator. Other scholars suggest that it is simply the more deferential form.[tpl]Cite book|title=Alternative Histories of English|author=Richard J.

Although the closest Modern English equivalent of prithee is please, the two terms presume different attitudes within the addressee. While please accompanies a request addressing itself to the positive desire of the addressee, as in "if it please you," prithee accompanies a request which addresses itself to the threat of being answered in the negative, as though the request were against the addressee's wishes.[tpl]Cite book|title=Speech Acts in the History of English|author=Andreas H.

This switch from stating the speaker's contrary desire to stating the speaker's wish not to impose signaled a cultural shift in the English-speaking world in which politeness became stated negatively rather than positively. Wider repercussions are observable in the replacement of such phrases as "excuse me" and "pardon me," which request understanding or forgiveness, with "I am sorry," which instead acknowledges the speaker's remorse.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Andreas H.

Arthur Herbert (May 28, 1907, Brooklyn - date of death unknown) was an American jazz drummer.
Both of Herbert's parents were of Trinidadian heritage.  He worked in a silver and gold refinery as a young man, playing local gigs in New York nightclubs and hotels in his spare time. He left industry in 1935 to join Eddie Williams's band, and soon after started his own band, the Rhythm Masters. In the 1930s and 1940s he worked as a sideman with musicians such as Pete Brown, Coleman Hawkins, Hot Lips Page, and Sidney Bechet.
In the 1950s Herbert went into semiretirement as a musician and started up his own pest extermination business. He played in various swing jazz revival ensembles, and toured with Lem Johnson in Poland in the 1960s.
Herbert taught his nephew, drummer Herb Lovelle, whom he insisted should know how to read sheet music, something black musicians were then not held to know. He got his nephew his first gig with Hot Lips Page. He also taught drummer Shelly Manne, according to Herb Lovelle.

The Dodge County Courthouse is an historic courthouse building located  in Eastman, Georgia. Built in 1908, it was designed by Eastman-born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who is noted for the  courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida, Georgia and Texas. The builder was M.L. Lewman & Company. This was the very first courthouse Hosford had ever designed. His commission was controversial because his father, Charlie Columbus Hosford, was a member of the building committee  appointed by the county commissioners. Since Edward C. Hosford then lived in Atlanta, it was rumored that he was going to farm the project out to the more experienced architect who had been bypassed in order to give him the commission, but he moved back to Eastman and did all the work himself.Caldwell, Wilber W, The Courthouse and the Depot: The Architecture of Hope in an Age of Despair: A Narrative Guide to Railroad Expansion and Its Impact on Public Architecture in Georgia, 1833-1910, Macon: Mercer University Press, 2001, p.252 & 366.National Register listings for Dodge County

Stanhope was sold by order of the Court of Session by deed in 1767 to a James Montgomery.  Many properties on the Stanhope estate were tenanted by members of the Tweedie family with whom the Murrays had at various times fought or intermarried.

Highway of Heartache is a 1996 feature film that was billed as the first Canadian country-western drag queen musical.  Written and directed by Gregory Wild, the film follows the misadventures of Wynona-Sue Turnpike (Barbara Chamberlin, who also write the film’s score) on a raucous and unlikely road to Nashville superstardom.  Backed up by a pair of transvestite guardian angels (played by The Big Wigs), Wynona-Sue faces a variety of indignities including an abusive husband, the threat of life imprisonment and venereal disease.  The film’s humor ranged from gross-out to surreal (the heroine’s gynecologist was an Elvis Presley imitator), and the entire film was shot on Day-Glo sets designed and built by Wild.Film Threat essay
Highway of Heartache was made in 1994 and had its theatrical premiere in New York in August 1996 at the Lower East Side (116 Suffolk Street) Lighthouse Cinema.  Critical reaction was mixed: Stephen Holden in the New York Times complained of a “gratingly hysterical pitch that makes a John Waters romp look like a Merchant-Ivory reverie…what began as a screaming Day-Glo comedy turns into a sensory endurance test.” New York Times review However, Ken Eisner of Variety dubbed it “the weirdest feature yet to come out of Canada” and “consistently funny” Variety review and Sandra Brennan in Allmovie stated the “weird and funny Canadian film has all the makings of a cult classic.” Allmovie review

Since 1980, 56 known hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions have affected the U.S. state of Maryland. Many of these storms also affect the country's capital, Washington, D.C., since the city is located on territory ceded by Maryland. Hurricanes are the most intense classification of these storms, while tropical storms and tropical depressions are generally weaker. The Delmarva Peninsula is often affected by cyclones   that brush the East Coast.[tpl]cite web|author=Tropical Prediction Center|title=Best Track Analysis|publisher=Unisys Corporation|accessdate=2008-05-08|url=http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/index.html[/tpl] Central and Western Maryland, as well as Washington, D.C., commonly receive rainfall from the remnants of storms that make landfall elsewhere and track northward. On rare occasions, the area experiences the effects of Pacific storms; one such example of this is Hurricane Tico, which made landfall on Mexico and moved inland. Four tropical cyclones in the state have caused five known deaths.
Hurricane Sandy was the deadliest storm, killing 11 people. The most damaging storm was Hurricane Irene, which resulted in $151 million in damage. The only storms to have caused hurricane force winds were Hurricane Irene of 2011, which caused hurricane force gusts along the beaches, and Hurricane Sandy of 2012, which caused hurricane force gusts as far inland as Gaithersburg, Maryland. There have been examples of a couple other storms which gusted to hurricane force, for example Hurricane Isabel of 2003.

Philippe Grégoire Yacé (January 23, 1920 – November 29, 1998) was an Ivorian politician and one time president of the National Assembly.
A teacher by training, Yacé was among the founders of a trade union for instructors; he also served as the secretary general of the country's lone political party, the PDCI, for 15 years before the post was abolished.  He was president of the Legislative Assembly and of the National Assembly, and from 1980 headed the High Court.  He then served as the president of the economic and social council up until his death in 1998.  He also served as mayor of Jacqueville, a deputy for the same constituency, a senator, and the spiritual leader of the "3A" (the alladian, aïzi, and akouri).  He was the so-called "dauphin" of Félix Houphouët-Boigny, with whom he collaborated closely for much of his career, and it was widely expected that he would be Houphouët-Boigny's successor upon the former's retirement.  But the elder statesman became wary of the influence Yacé was wielding, and in 1980 effectively disowned him, ending his political career.
Yacé died in Abidjan in 1998.

John Howison (or Howisone, Howisoune, or Howieson, c. 1530 - 1618) was Minister in the Parish of Cambuslang during a turbulent time in Scotland’s history. He was imprisoned several times for his campaign for a Presbyterian, as opposed to Episcopal structure for the Church of Scotland. (He was always very quickly released). He also often reprimanded the King James VI for taking the advice of evil counsellors. He quarrelled with his own parishioners and was convicted of publishing a doctored version of an Act of Parliament, but he died peacefully in Cambuslang, apparently resigned to accepting Bishops in the Kirk.

ULD lost 2/3 of the seats, due to GNP's victory in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gangwon-do (South Korea), and also fewer local votes in Chungcheong. However, GNP not reached half seats, so 16th parliament became Hung Parliament, and this is the only parliament that President's party lost majority. So democrats, ULD and even Democratic People's Party(DPP) started coalition again to gain majority. The voter turnout was 57.2%.

[[Bon PeKaO]]
CATEGORIES: Economic history of Poland, History of Poland (1945–89), Currencies of Poland

Bon PeKaO checks were substitute legal tender used in the People's Republic of Poland. Polish communist government, desperate for hard foreign currency, introduced them in 1960. Citizens of Poland had to exchange foreign currency they had into these notes (bony in plural), issued by the government-controlled Bank Pekao. They were only accepted in special shops in Poland (Pewex, Baltona) where one could buy restricted, imported goods. Outside of Poland, bony had no value and were not regarded as legal tender.
In the 1950s and the 1960s, turnover of Western currency was strictly prohibited, and since January 1960, pre-World War Two currency was purchased by the national bank, which paid for it with bony. Since the 1970s, these regulations were not controlled as strictly as before, which resulted in a flourishing black market of foreign currency. All Polish citizens, who received money orders from the so-called “second payments area” (Polish: "drugi obszar płatniczy"; which covered Western Europe and North America), were not paid in real cash - dollars, pounds or marks, but instead, were issued with bony. This applied to those who received all kinds of payments from the West - salaries, pensions, monetary gifts, grants, donations. 
Bon PeKaO was used only for purchases at Pewex or Baltona stores, which were controlled by the government. These stores sold imported luxury products, otherwise not available on the market - coffee, chocolate, liquors, household appliances, cars. In the course of time, the bon became the unofficial second currency of Poland, due to rising inflation of the złoty. In the 1960s, the price of one bon was 70-80 złoty, in the 1970s it rose to 150 zł, and in 1981, to 400 złoty. By 1989, the price of one bon was 7000 złoty, and finally, after the monetary reform of Leszek Balcerowicz, the price of one bon (equivalent to one US dollar) was established at 9500 zł. Following the collapse of the Communist system, foreign currency trade became legal, which voided the bony. 
Bony were printed in banknotes equivalent to 1 US cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 US dollar, 2 dollars, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, 20 dollars, 50 dollars and 100 dollars. They first appeared on the market on January 1, 1960.

[[Supplement (publishing)]]
CATEGORIES: Publications

A supplement is a publication that has a role secondary to that of another preceding or concurrent publication.
A follow-on publication complements its predecessor, either by bringing it up to date (e.g. the Index Catalogue), or by otherwise enhancing the predecessor's coverage of a particular topic or subject matter, as in the Tosefta. Supplements are particularly used in gaming hobbies.
A newspaper supplement, often a weekly section of its parent, usually has a tabloid or Sunday magazine format and covers wide-ranging and less time-critical subjects, as in The American Weekly, the 2004 version of Life, and Parade. Newspaper supplements became common in France and Germany in the mid to late 19th century—they were called feuilleton in French. In Chinese, they are called fukan.
Advertising supplements periodically accompany corresponding newspapers and are prepared by the paper's advertising staff instead of its editorial staff. It is common for them to cover topics such as real estate and automobiles on behalf of the paper's frequent advertisers.
Some supplements are spin-offs from a newspaper. They are sold separately and typically cover a specific topic, such as the Times Literary Supplement and the Times Educational Supplement
Supplements found on some DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs are more commonly known as special features, bonus features, or bonus material.
In education, supplemental materials are educational materials designed to accompany or expand on the information presented on course textbooks. These can include printed materials, CDs, websites, or other electronic materials.[tpl]cite web|title=HEOA - Higher Education Opportunity Act|url=http://usm.maine.edu/books/heoa-highter-education-opportunity-act|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Jewish American literature, Jews and Judaism in the United States, Publishing organizations, Jewish printing and publishing

Jewish Book Month is an important annual event in both the American Jewish community and the publishing world.   It is sponsored by the Jewish Book Council. It is held annually in November, to come shortly before the Chanukah gift-giving season.   Book fairs are held in most major cities with Jewish communities, albeit not in New York, and feature lectures by visiting authors.http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA321290.html
Jewish communities sponsor the fairs  to promote Jewish culture.  For the industry, they are a major marketing tool.  According to Publisher’s Weekly book fairs generate over $3 million in annual revenue.http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA255204.html  For many years the  Jewish Book Council held its annual meeting simultaneously with Book Expo America, enabling Jewish book fair planners to look over the forthcoming books and meet the authors.Selling the Jewish Book - 28 October 2002 - Publishers Weekly   In 2004 this system was replaced by an annual meeting of the Jewish Book Network coordinated by the Jewish Book Council.
Since 1994, the Council has been run by Carolyn Starman Hessel who is credited with growing Jewish Book Month and the associated book tours into one of the most important marketing events in American publishing, and a cultural center of American Jewish life.  Hessel is credited with a knack for picking hot new novelists, she is said to have launched the careers of Nathan Englander, Myla Goldberg, Nicole Krauss and Jonathan Safran Foer by selecting them and sending them on tours of the Jewish book fairs.
The annual meeting is, effectively, an annual author’s audition.  The New York Times calls it, “a bizarre rite of passage: the Jewish book tour casting call.”  Jeffrey Goldberg characterized the audition as an experience “somewhere between JDate and a camel auction.”  Authors of books that range from serious works of religious history to comic novels stand and speak for precisely 2 minutes to an audience of over one hundred organizers of Jewish book fairs and lecture series.  Getting signed to a tour of these venues is said to have the power not merely to launch a Jewish-themed book, but to lift titles from Jewish to general success."Star Search", Rachel Donadio,  June 24, 2007, New York Times

The Sonata for Cello and Piano in D minor, Op. 40, was one of Dmitri Shostakovich's early works, composed in 1934 just prior to his censure by Soviet authorities of his music, notably the opera Lady Macbeth of Mtensk, that was deemed too bourgeois and decadent for the Soviet people. It was also a period of emotional turmoil in his life, as he had fallen in love with a young student at a Leningrad festival featuring his Lady Macbeth. Their affair resulted in a brief divorce from his wife Nina, and it was in August, during their period of separation, that he wrote the cello sonata, completing it within a few weeks and giving its premiere in Moscow on 25 December with his close friend, the cellist Viktor Kubatsky, who was also the piece's dedicatee. By the next autumn Shostakovich and Nina had remarried, with her being pregnant with their daughter, who was born in 1936.

CATEGORIES: Earthquakes in Guatemala, Geographic areas of seismological interest, Seismic faults of Guatemala, Strike-slip faults

The Motagua Fault (also, Motagua Fault Zone) is a major, active left lateral-moving transform fault which cuts across Guatemala, continuing offshore along the southern Pacific coast of Mexico, returning onshore along the southernmost tip of Oaxaca, then continuing offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench near Acapulco.  It forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate.  It is considered the onshore continuation of the Cayman Trench which runs under the Caribbean Sea.
The Motagua Fault is regarded by some geologists as part of a system of faults designated the "Motagua-Polochic system" rather than as a discrete single boundary.  The Polochic fault (also referred to as the Chixoy-Polochic Fault) lies north and parallel to the Motagua Fault and shares some of the motion between the North American and Caribbean Plates. 
The Motagua Fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in Guatemala's history, including the 7.5 Mw Guatemala 1976 earthquake.USGS Historic Earthquakes

A credit card is a payment card issued to users as a system of payment. It allows the cardholder to pay for goods and services based on the holder's promise to pay for them. The issuer of the card creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the consumer (or the user) from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user.
A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month.[tpl]cite book | last = Schneider | first = Gary | title = Electronic Commerce | publisher = Course Technology | location = Cambridge | year = 2010 | isbn = 0-538-46924-2 | page=497[/tpl]  In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.
The size of most credit cards is [tpl]Fraction|3|3|8[/tpl] × [tpl]Fraction|2|1|8[/tpl] in (85.60 × 53.98 mm),The metric dimensions are "soft metric", derived from the original standard inch dimensions. conforming to the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 standard. Credit cards have an embossed bank card number complying with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. Both of these standards are maintained and further developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17/WG 1.

[[Hardfacing]]
CATEGORIES: Welding

Hardfacing is a metalworking process where harder or tougher material is applied to a base metal. It is welded to the base material, and generally takes the form of specialized electrodes for arc welding or filler rod for oxyacetylene and TIG welding. Powder metal alloys are used in (PTA) also called Powder plasma welding system and Thermal spray processes like HVOF, Plasma spray, Fuse and spray etc.
Hardfacing may be applied to a new part during production to increase its wear resistance, or it may be used to restore a worn-down surface. Hardfacing by arc welding is a surfacing operation to extend the service life of industrial components, pre-emptively on new components, or as part of a maintenance program. The result of significant savings in machine down time and production costs has meant that this process has been adopted across many industries such as Steel, Cement, Mining, Petrochemical, Power, Sugar cane and Food. According to the results of an experimental study, the SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding) and the GMAW (Gas Metal Arc Welding) hardfacing processes were effective in reducing the wear on the mouldboard ploughshare. With the SMAW and GMAW hardfacing processes, the life span of the ploughshare was increased approximately 2 times 1.
Extensive work in research has resulted in the development of a wide range of alloys and welding procedures. The optimum alloy selection is made considering the component service conditions and feedback of the service performance.
For each industrial application and wear phenomena, there is a welding electrode to provide wear resistance.
Hardfacing can be deposited by various welding methods:
Commonly applied materials include cobalt-based alloys (such as stellite), nickel-based alloys, chromium carbide alloys and NOREM.

CATEGORIES: Postcolonial literature, 1996 books

Cereus Blooms at Night Mootoo, Shani. 1996. Cereus Blooms at Night. New York: Avon Books.(1996) is the first novel published by film-maker, artist, and writer Shani Mootoo. The novel recounts the story of an old lady named Mala Ramchandin through the narrative of Tyler, a male nurse at Paradise Alms House. Although the setting of the novel (the town of Paradise in the country Lantanacamara) is deliberately left ambiguous, it is thought to be patterned after the island of Trinidad, where Mootoo lived as a child.Kyungwon Hong, G. "'A Shared Queerness': Colonialism, Transnationalism, and Sexuality in Shani Mootoo's Cereus Blooms at Night." Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism 7.1 (2006): 73-103. Cereus and other flora found throughout the novel, the creolized dialect spoken by the inhabitants of Lantanacamara, and the racial composition of its population (white people, Indians, black people) are all suggestive of Caribbean society. Other possibilities would include Guyana, Suriname, and Mauritius, all of which have sizable Indian populations.Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin

[[North American Family Campers Association]]
CATEGORIES: Camping in the United States

The North American Family Campers Association (NAFCA) is a non-profit family camping association. NAFCA is built on a structure of volunteers who hold offices to create a form of government.  NAFCA is an international organization that has members throughout the United States and Canada.  The 'full board' consists of President, Vice President, Second Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, State Directors and Past President.  Each State has a 'state director', 'secretary', 'treasurer', and 'deputies'.  Chapters can range in size and are organized by their officers 'president', 'vice president', 'secretary', 'treasurer', and delegates. NAFCA was formed in 1957 at Otter River State Forest in Baldwinville, MA. Once called NECA (New England Camping Association), in 1967 as the North American Family Campers Association was renamed.
To compete with Good Sam and FMCA, NAFCA in the late 1960s and early 1970s started to form chapters across the country. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, many of the chapters that were not in New England began to disband because of lack of travel and the financial problems of NAFCA.
Since then, chapters have expanded once again and chapters can now be found outside of the New England area. Now in existence there are chapters formed in Florida in the 90’s for those who won't miss the snowy winters in New England and travel Florida, called Palm Tree, Chapter 27; and in areas of Canada. As of 2011, a new chapter was formed in Florida to serve the Orlando, Kissimmee and Central Florida area called Orlando 183.
The first chapter to join NAFCA was in Springfield, VT. The newest chapter was formed on February 19, 2011 and it is based in Orlando, FL.
Due to the nature of the organization, non-profit, it has to be self-sufficient.  NAFCA supports itself with funds generated by membership, fundraisers, selling of logo-inscribed merchandise and others.  NAFCA advertises by participating in camping shows to generate interest and memberships.  Camping is a great family tradition filled with activity; long-lasting memories and generations of fun can be had.
One of NAFCA's chapters runs a camping show. Pioneer Valley Chapter 8, also known as PV8, based out of Springfield, MA is the largest NAFCA chapter, based on membership, and it is also the promoter of the annual Springfield RV Camping & Outdoor Show at the Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield, MA.
NAFCA traditionally has campouts during the year, in which all of NAFCA's members are encouraged to attend and reconnect. They are the conservation weekends at Otter River State Forest (held twice annually in April and October, birthplace of NAFCA), the NAFCA Spring Safari (which is held in May), and a week long campout called the NAFCAree (usually in July)
States of NAFCA hold their own gatherings as well which invite the NAFCA public to attend and support each others.  Each state holds its own fundraiser, which is called a Fall Frolic.  At this event chapters can purchase a low-cost booth in which to sell something  to the membership for a chapter fundraiser. Chapters also plan their own events and campouts during the year.
Everything in NAFCA is based on camping and family fun.  Members range in age, race, sex, size, hometown and more creating a welcoming group of friendly campers.  NAFCA has games to play and competitions that take place annually, everyone is able and encouraged to attend.  Great fun can be had by all.
NAFCA has something called the "7 C's" - the seven c's are general rules to live by which are the base of all campers should live by: Care, Caution, Courteousy, Conversation, Cleanliness, Cooperation and Common Sense.  These c's can be applied to everyday life and are the backbone of good natured people.
NAFCA has a magazine which each member receives with their membership called Campfire Chatter.  The Campfire Chatter has articles submitted by committees, and members to tell each othter of what's going on in NAFCA and what events are being planned.  Reservation forms are handy to plan your camping adventures for the season (May - October).  There are recipes, a calendar of events and a message from the president. Features also include a listing of members who are sick, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, birth announcements and the like called NAFCA Cares.  Features are created to continue communication lines between members who may not see each other often.

Burr Shafer (1899 – June 25, 1965) was an American cartoonist. His cartoon collections featured the character of J. Wesley Smith appearing in various historical settings.E.g. Through History with J. Wesley Smith and its sequels. His historical satires moved U.S. President Harry S. Truman to write "I'm very proud that I'm smart enough to get the point." His cartoons appeared in The New Yorker and The Saturday Review of Literature.
The J. Wesley Smith character, while not explicitly identified with the explorer John Smith, was depicted in the explorer's situation in a cartoon panel about Pocahontas. The joke, as he had his head on her father's chopping block with the ax about to come down, was that, with the middle name of Wesley, he should not be confused with real John Smith.
Burr Shafer died in Orange County, California.

Serdar (Count) Jovan Simonov Plamenac ([tpl]lang-sr-cyrl|Јован Симонов Пламенац[/tpl]) (1873–1944) was a Montenegrin politician. 
Starting out as a prominent leader of the True People's Party in the Principality of Montenegro, state that would soon transform into a kingdom, Plamenac was a staunch supporter of the country's monarch Prince Nikola Petrović-Njegoš who changed his role to king in 1910. As World War I broke out and King Nikola secretly fled the country after it got invaded by the Central powers, Plamenac denounced the king. 
Following the war, Plamenac became one of the leaders of the Greens and a chief protagonist of the 1919 Christmas Rebellion in opposition to the post-war Montenegrin unification with Serbia and subsequent creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Upon fleeing to Italy in wake of the failed rebellion, Plamenac became head of the Montenegrin authorities in exile. At the post he presided over units of exiled Greens who trained in the town of Gaeta with Italian support before being covertly shipped back home across the Adriatic where a low-level guerilla insurgency continued even after the failed rebellion. Plamenac also tried to gain political support abroad for his organization's opposition to the newly created South Slavic state, but achieved very little in that regard. 
By mid-1920s, Plamenac did a complete turnaround, deciding to cut a deal with the Kingdom of SCS authorities, which allowed him to return home where he became a centrist politician with Serbian People's Radical Party of Nikola Pašić.
He ended up as a World War II Nazi collaborator whose activity during the war is highly disputed and controversial.

[[Coat of arms of Orkney]]

CATEGORIES: Scottish coats of arms, Orkney, 1975 establishments in Scotland

The coat of arms of Orkney was adopted on 3 March 1975 and is among the oldest of those of the Scottish Council Areas, as the Orkney Islands Council was unaffected by the 1996 local government reform. With the exception of the islands area coronet and a different sinister supporter the current coat of arms is also identical to that of the pre-1975 Orkney County Council.
The shield depicts the Clan Sinclair ship and the Norwegian lion. This reflects the history of Orkney. Before Norwegian occupation the aboriginal inhabitants or Picts (one of the founding nations of Scotland) settled on the island thousands of years before a Norse invasion and the island was under Norway for several centuries. The island was pawned as dowry security in 1468, to the kingdom of Scotland, where members of the Sinclar family held the Earldom of Orkney for almost a century in the Late Middle Ages in fealty to the monarchs of Norway.

CARE is a free financial literacy initiative that makes experienced members of the Bankruptcy Community available to teach the importance of financial education. These presentations are the perfect supplement to any financial literacy program offered by you or your school, especially to any unit on consumer credit, and they can be made during individual classroom periods or to larger student groups, including senior assemblies. CARE's primary target is high school seniors and college freshmen who are most at risk because, as hungry consumers, they are aggressively marketed by the credit card industry at a time when they carry a very low Financial I.Q.
CARE has a presence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The American media has dubbed this program a "scared straight" credit program for students. CARE is honored and excited to be a national partner of the Jump$tart Coalition and a member of the National Financial Education Network. CARE is grateful to NextStep Magazine for media support, and to the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees, the United States Trustee Program and the Federal Judicial Center for their financial support.
The CARE web site (www.care4yourfuture.org) supplements the live presentations with free downloads in the form of handouts, videos, PowerPoint presentations, games and more for free public use. Our CARE Locator Map is powered by Google to make finding a contact person near you as easy as possible. You can also schedule a presentation in your area or help us start a new CARE Program where you live.

[[Service-learning in engineering education]]
CATEGORIES: Community building, Applied learning, Alternative education

Many engineering educators see service-learning as the solution to several prevalent problems in engineering education today.  In the past, engineering curriculum has fluctuated between emphasizing engineering science to focusing more on practical aspects of engineering.  Today, many engineering educators are concerned their students do not receive enough practical knowledge of engineering and its context.  Some speculate that adding context to engineering help to motivate engineering students’ studies and thus improve retention and diversity in engineering schools.  Others feel that the teaching styles do not match the learning styles of engineering students.  
Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service-learning as a way to both implement a constructivism in engineering education as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service-learning into their curricula.

[[World AIDS Vaccine Day]]

CATEGORIES: May observances, Health awareness days, HIV vaccine research, AIDS activism

World AIDS Vaccine Day, also known as HIV Vaccine Awareness Day, is observed annually on May 18. HIV vaccine advocates mark the day by promoting the continued urgent need for a vaccine to prevent HIV infection and AIDS. They acknowledge and thank the thousands of volunteers, community members, health professionals, supporters and scientists who are working together to find a safe and effective AIDS vaccine and urge the international community to recognize the importance of investing in new technologies as a critical element of a comprehensive response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
The concept of World AIDS Vaccine Day is rooted in a May 18, 1997 commencement speech at Morgan State University made by then-President Bill Clinton. Clinton challenged the world to set new goals in the emerging age of science and technology and develop an AIDS vaccine within the next decade stating, “Only a truly effective, preventive HIV vaccine can limit and eventually eliminate the threat of AIDS.”
The first World AIDS Vaccine Day was observed on May 18, 1998 to commemorate the anniversary of Clinton’s speech, and the tradition continues today. Each year communities around the globe hold a variety of activities on World AIDS Vaccine Day to raise awareness for AIDS vaccines, educate communities about HIV prevention and research for an AIDS vaccine and bring attention to the ways in which ordinary people can be a part of the international effort to stem the pandemic.

Tallassee (also "Talassee," "Talisi," "Tellassee," and various similar spellings) is a prehistoric and historic Native American site in Blount County and Monroe County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States.  Tallassee was the southernmost of a string of Overhill Cherokee villages that spanned the lower Little Tennessee River in the 18th century.  Although it receives scant attention in primary historical accounts, Tallassee is one of the few Overhill towns to appear on every major 18th-century map of the Little Tennessee Valley. 
The Tallassee site is now submerged by Chilhowee Lake, an impoundment of the Little Tennessee River created by the completion of Chilhowee Dam in 1957.  The shoreline above the site is now home to the Calderwood Hydroelectric Development Area, which was established by the Aluminum Company of America in the 1920s as a base for the construction of Cheoah, Santeetlah, and Calderwood dams further up the river.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee: From War Trail to Landing Strip, 1795-1955 (Nashville: Benson Print Co., 1957), 284.

The 1977 Atlanta Falcons season was the team's 12th year in the National Football League. The team finished the season 7–7, and did not make the NFL's postseason.
Although the Falcons' offense struggled, the defense was dominant.Pro-Football-Reference.com: 1977 Atlanta Falcons The Falcons' 129 points allowed not only led the league, but established an all-time NFL record for fewest points allowed in a 14-game NFL season.Pro-Football-Reference.com: In a single season, from 1960 to 1977, in the regular season, sorted by ascending Points Allowed.

Football analytics site Cold Hard Football Facts call the 1977 Falcons "the stingiest defense of the Super Bowl Era. In fact, it was the stingiest defense since World War II. Atlanta surrendered just 9.2 PPG, or a total of 129 points in the 14-game season. For a little perspective: the 2012 Bills gave up 131 points in their first four games. That unit was truly a no-name defense at its finest: despite its status as the stingiest defense since World War II, the 1977 Falcons sent only two defenders to the Pro Bowl: cornerback Rolland Lawrence and defensive end Claude Humphrey. ... It was truly a one-hit wonder of a unit: the 1976 Falcons possessed one of the worst defenses in the league (22.3 PPG); and it largely fell apart in 1978 (18.1 PPG). The most famous personality on the 1977 Falcons was not a player but defensive assistant Jerry Glanville, who installed in a swarming style of play in Atlanta remembered as the "Grits Blitz" defense."Cold Hard Football Facts, The 100 Stingiest Defenses In Football History April 01, 2013

It is located on the border of the Junin department and is within the boundaries of the Nor Yauyos-Cochas Landscape Reserve (Reserva Paisajistica Nor Yauyos Cochas). The community of Tomas has about 600 alpacas, a herd of 30 vicugnas, among other Andean Camelids. 
Although difficult to get to, the community of Tomas offers a hotel and in-home hospitality services, three in home restaurants, and a variety of touristic sites to visit.  Some of the touristic highlights include the Caida de Angel (Angel Falls), the Camino de Ayacoto (Ayacoto trail) which is a 2-3 hour route that passes through 2 sets of pre-Inca ruins, visiting the Unidad de Produccion de Alpacas Contadera (Andean Alpaca Farm), and hikes up the Sinwa River with the locals. If you can handle the altitude (about 11,500 feet above sea level) and are up for visiting real, untouched rural Peru, the visit is well worth the effort.

His father died when the younger Erskine was twelve years old, and in 1874 the family firm passed from the management of a trustee to the joint control of Erskine junior, a brother, and a half-brother.  By 1888, Erskine junior was in full control of the business following his half-brother's death and his brother's withdrawal.
The company grew rapidly with the robust world demand for high-quality linens.  Notably, Beveridge tapped the large North American market and eventually opened a New York warehouse.  By 1903, Erskine Beveridge & Co. Ltd. was a world leader in fine linen and had three branch factories in addition to its primary works in Dunfermline.
Notwithstanding his dedication to and success in business, Beveridge was devoted to Scottish antiquarian studies.  His first published book was a compilation of grave inscriptions called The Churchyard Memorials of Crail (1893), and he published two further works about his native Fife:  A Bibliography of Dunfermline and the West of Fife (1901) and The Burgh Records of Dunfermline, 1485-1584 (1917).
Perhaps his greatest antiquarian contribution was to the archaeological study of the Hebrides.  He published Coll and Tiree: Their Prehistoric Forts and Ecclesiastical Antiquities in 1903.  He owned a large house (now a ruin [tpl]Coord|57|39|25.50|N|7|24|42|W[/tpl]) on the tidal island of Vallay, North Uist, and he excavated many sites in the area around Vallay, dating from the first millennium BC to the first millennium AD.  These excavations, together with his studies of other parts of North Uist, led to the publication of North Uist: Its Archaeology and Topography in 1911.  Today, he is regarded as one of the first and most significant archaeological excavators in the Outer Hebrides.[tpl]cite book |title=The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles |last=Armit |first=Ian |year=1996 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7486-0640-5 |pages=8–10 [/tpl]  Some of the objects that he recovered are preserved in the Erskine Beveridge Collection at the National Museums Scotland.
His notes formed the basis of two further books that were published posthumously.  The 'Abers' and 'Invers' of Scotland (1923) was a study of Scottish place-names, and Fergusson's Scottish Proverbs (1924) was an annotated edition of a compilation published by David Fergusson in Edinburgh in 1641.
He was also an amateur photographer, illustrating some of his books with his own photographs.  A two-volume collection of collotype reproductions was published in 1922 as Wanderings with a Camera, 1882-1898.  The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland holds about 500 of his original glass plate photographic negatives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/bigPicture.html |accessdate=2008-04-26|title=Big Picture |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080410075853/http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/bigPicture.html  |archivedate = 2008-04-10[/tpl]
Beveridge was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, serving as vice president of the latter from 1915 to 1918.  The University of St Andrew's awarded him an honorary degree.
He married twice, first in 1872 to Mary Owst (1853–1904), with whom he had six sons and a daughter, and second to Margaret Scott Inglis, with whom he had two sons.  He was a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church.  He died at his house in Dunfermline, called St Leonard's Hill, after an operation for throat cancer.  He was buried in the churchyard of Dunfermline Abbey.

The Norsk Flyindustri Finnmark 5A (named for the Norwegian county) was an amphibious flying-boat airliner built in Norway in the late 1940s. The single prototype was operated by the VLS airline, but no orders for additional aircraft were received, and a refined version designated 5A-II was never built. The Finnmark was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane with twin engines housed in nacelles on the wings, and the first twin-engined aircraft constructed in Norway.Hagby, Kai (1998): Fra Nielsen & Winther til Boeing 747 : norske sivilregistrerte fly 1919-1998, p. 59 A specially-designed combination wheel-ski undercarriage retracted into wide sponsons on the sides of the flying boat hull. 
This undercarriage (built by Dowty in England) was the subject of patents in Norway, Sweden, and Canada, and was constructed in such a way that the skis would be properly aligned for retraction and extension, and while lowered in flight, but would be free to move under landing forces, pivoting and deflecting to facilitate a smooth landing on rough snow or ice.Flight 2 January 1953, p. 12. 
The prototype Finnmark made its first flight on 17 September 1949, as a pure flying boat, being fitted with its retractable undercarriage in the winter of 1951–52. Before 1954, it was modifed by removing its undercarriage, and replacing the sponsons by wing-mounted stabilising floats. It entered service with Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap that year, flying a service between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger. It was later sold to Norrønfly.Stroud Aeroplane Monthly August 1993, pp. 62–63. The airworthiness certificate expired in 1961, and the aircraft was scrapped in 1965.

Vampire Lesbians of Sodom is a satirical play written by Charles Busch. It features a series of vignettes that deals with the lives of two eponymous immortal vampire lesbians, a creature known as The Succubus who is also known as La Condessa or Magda Legerdemaine, and the virgin-turned-vampire who becomes known as Madelaine Astarte and Madelaine Andrews. The two are locked in eternal, if comic, antagonism after surviving the downfall of the mythical Biblical city in question. Particular conflict occurs when both women arrive in 1920s/1930s Broadway and Hollywood and masquerade as silent film stars. A final scene in Las Vegas in the 1980s sees them finally reach a truce.

The creator of the website has been a closely guarded secret, though the piece has somewhat recently been claimed by artist Martine Neddam.  While the use of taboo subject matters are what initially "provokes heated reactions", the manipulation of cyber identity and the ability of the creator to maintain anonymity for so long are the significant reasons this website has garnered its "international reputation"  in the Internet art community.

[[Loughton Camp]]

CATEGORIES: Epping Forest (district), Iron Age sites in England, Hill forts in Essex

Loughton Camp is an Iron Age (~500 BC) Hill fort in Epping Forest,City of London – Epping Forest[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] one mile (1.6 km) North West of the town of Loughton.
The camp's earthworks cover an area of approximately 10 acres (4 hectares) and are visible today as a low bank and ditch encircling the main camp. The banks were most probably once a single high rampart, used for defence and the appearance of the ditch suggests it was once very wide and deep in places. 
The camp lies on one of the highest points in the surrounding area, on a ridge of high ground, likely to have once been strategic. It is speculated that the camp was used by the Trinovantes in defence against the Catuvellauni.Epping Forest District Council – Museum. Eppingforestdc.gov.uk (2008-02-27). Retrieved on 2011-08-28. Its elevation suggests that the camp was possibly once a lookout post. However, it may have simply been used as fortification for protection of cattle. A stone Iron Age grain millstone (quern) was found close by. More colourfully, local legend has it that Boudica used the Camp, and that Ambresbury Banks was the site of her defeat in AD61 however there is no evidence to corroborate this.http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B1A67933-0535-4439-805C-365E8305C05A/0/OS_EF_AncientEarthworks.pdf City of London – Ancient Forst / Iron Age Camps 
The South Western edge of the camp falls away sharply to an area known as Kate's Cellar (a hermit who reputedly once lived in this area of the forest).  An early 19th Century map shows Dick Turpin's hideout here (there are a number of locations which within Epping Forest's [tpl]convert|6000|acre|km2[/tpl] which claim the same).
The camp was 'discovered' by Mr Benjamin Harris Cowper in 1872.B H Cowper Ancient Earthworks in Epping Forest The Archaeological Journal Volume 33 (1876). Archive.org (2001-03-10). Retrieved on 2011-08-28. The first archaeology carried out was by General Pitt-Rivers in 1881. In 1882 the Essex Field Club further excavated the banks.

[[Joint attention]]
CATEGORIES: Language acquisition, Child development, Infancy, Primates, Attention, Psychological concepts, Autism

Joint attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.[tpl]cite book |last1=Moore |first1=C.|last2=Dunham |first2=P |title= Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1995 |isbn=0-8058-1437-X [/tpl] 
Subsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.
Other animals such as great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, dogs, and horses also show some elements of joint attention.

Harry White (June 1, 1898 – August 14, 1962) was an American jazz trombonist.
As a teenager, White played drums, then switched to trombone after moving to Washington, D.C around 1919. In the 1920s he played with Duke Ellington, Elmer Snowden, and Claude Hopkins, then started a family band called the White Brothers Orchestra in 1925. This ensemble played the mid-Atlantic states for several years.
Late in the 1920s, White played with Luis Russell, then joined the Mills Blue Rhythm Band in 1931. The following year he joined the orchestra of Cab Calloway, working as an arranger and composer in addition to duties on trombone. One of Calloway's trumpeters, Edwin Swayzee, overheard White use the term "jitterbug", and wrote a tune called "The Jitterbug" because of it; Calloway's 1934 recording of it brought the term into widespread currency. He returned to play under Russell in 1935 while Russell's band backed Louis Armstrong. He quit playing for part of the 1930s, then later played with Manzie Johnson, Hot Lips Page, Edgar Hayes, and Bud Freeman.

Maria Liberia Peters (born May 20, 1941) was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Antilles from 1984 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1994.
Born Maria Peters in Willemstad, Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, she attended school and earned a teaching degree in the Netherlands. She later married Niels Liberia, a civil servant. Together they adopted two children.
Liberia Peters fell into politics almost accidentally. She was involved in children's issues alongside teaching as her main profession.  She felt that going into politics was the only way to achieve substantial changes, saying, "There comes a moment when you realize that if you really want to make a difference, the only way is through politics, and then you walk right into it. In my own case, I thought. Well, I’ll try it, and if I don’t like it, I’ll say goodbye. But then you realize you’ve entered a one-way street, and you remain because you are continually challenged."
Her road to politics began in the 1970s, when she started parents' groups and became a member of the National People's Party. In 1975, after being encouraged by others to run for office, she earned a seat on the Curaçao Island Council where she stayed a member for the next five years. In 1982 she was appointed to the legislature of the Netherlands Antilles and also became the Minister of Economic Affairs.  After the coalition government she worked under collapsed in June 1984, she agreed to form a new coalition and was elected as Prime Minister, a position that she held from 1984-1986 and later from 1988-1994. She attempted a third run in 1994 but her party lost the election. She did however, remain in Parliament.
Prime Minister Maria Liberia Peters is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

[[Tehuantepec Ridge]]
CATEGORIES: Underwater ridges of the Pacific Ocean, Plate tectonics, Geography of Mexico

The Tehuantepec Ridge is a linear undersea ridge located off the west coast of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean.  It is the remnant of an old fracture zone, and not a tectonic spreading center ridge (see Mid-Ocean Ridge).  It extends from the eastern end of the Clipperton Fracture Zone northeastward toward Mexico until it is subducted into the Middle America Trench.  It lies within the tectonic Cocos Plate, separating the lower and older seafloor of the Guatemala Basin which lies southeast of the ridge from higher and younger seafloor which lies to its northwest.
Current research indicates that the ridge was formed as a fracture zone and transform fault along the East Pacific Rise.  As a result of a change in the motion of the Pacific Plate about 13 million years ago, there was also a change in the orientation of the East Pacific Rise, which in turn reoriented the fracture zone, creating the current alignment that is today's Clipperton Fracture Zone.  The Tehuantepec Ridge preserves the previous orientation.
Some researchers have hypothesized that the subducted portion of the Tehuantepec Ridge under Mexico is responsible for the existence of the El Chichón volcano as well as the other volcanoes of what is called the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc.  Studies of the 1982 eruption of El Chichón indicated its erupted output was unusual compared to other volcanoes in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt which lies well to the northwest.  The anomaly is thought to result from the distinctive composition of the rocks which comprise the Tehuantepec Ridge.Vlad C.

Alasdair Donald MacDuff Liddell CBE (15 January 1949 - 31 December 2012) was one of the architects of Britain's health strategy in the 1990s.[tpl]cite web|author=Joe Churcher |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exnhs-policy-chief-alasdair-liddell-dies-aged-63-8438897.html |title=Ex-NHS policy chief Alasdair Liddell dies aged 63 - UK Politics - UK |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-01-09[/tpl] As Director of Planning at the Department of Health (1994–2000) he led the process of setting national priorities for the National Health Service (NHS). He resigned, reputedly over policy differences with ministers, and subsequently acted as an advisor to health charities like the King's Fund (where he was a Senior Associate) and to health sector companies and consultancies. He was Senior Counsel to Bell Pottinger Group and was non-executive Deputy Chairman of Healthcare Locums plc, effectively taking executive responsibility in early 2011 when the company was found to have financial irregularities leading to the suspension of the company's chief executive Kate Bleasedale.
Liddell was educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh, and Balliol College, Oxford (1967–70). He moved from the voluntary sector to health management and as chief of the East Anglian Regional Health Authority he pioneered the Rubber Windmill, a simulation involving large numbers of clinicians, health managers, journalists and others over several days, which tested (and found wanting) the government's plans to introduce internal markets to the NHS. The Windmill was highly influential and led to changes in the government's approach. Liddell's simulation idea has since been used repeatedly to assess the impact of the market-based reforms, notably for the King's Fund in 2007.Alasdair Liddell obituary Niall Dickson, The Guardian, 11 January 2013Ex-NHS policy chief Alasdair Liddell dies aged 63 Joe Churcher, The Independent, 4 January 2013
As Director of Planning at the Department of Health Liddell had Board level responsibility for strategy, NHS information and IT, NHS Communications, and a number of key policy areas. After the 1997 election he led the team supporting Ministers in laying the foundations for much of current government policy for the NHS. He was awarded the CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours 1997 for services to the NHS.Alasdair Liddell Obituary, The Times , January 11, 2013

William Clifford "Cliff" Nugent (born 3 March 1929 in Islington) is a former English professional footballer.
Nugent was playing non-league football for Headington United when Cardiff City manager Cyril Spiers spotted him and brought him to Ninian Park in January 1951. He did not make his debut for the club until the following season, in a 1-0 win over Hull City, but he eventually managed to force his way into the side during the 1953-54 season. He scored his first goal for Cardiff in a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 1954. He helped the club avoid relegation on the final day of the season in the next season but injury ruled him out for all but one game during the 1955-56 campaign, making an incredible return the next year by scoring a hattrick during a 7-0 thrashing of Barnsley.
He left the club in November 1958 and signed for Mansfield Town where he spent two years before moving into non-league football with Weymouth.

"Steiner Inellipse" — From MathWorld, A Wolfram Web Resource, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SteinerInellipse.html. of a triangle is the unique ellipse inscribed in the triangle and tangent to the sides at their midpoints. It is an example of an inconic. By comparison the inscribed circle and Mandart inellipse of a triangle are other inconics that are tangent to the sides, but not at the midpoints unless the triangle is equilateral. The Steiner inellipse is attributed by DörrieH. Dörrie, 100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics, Their History and Solution (trans. D.

Henry Shalofsky, better known as Hank Shaw (23 June 1926, London - 26 October 2006, Kent) was an English bebop jazz trumpeter.
Shaw played with Teddy Foster's band during World War II at the age of 15. In the latter half of the decade he played in London with Oscar Rabin, Frank Weir, and Tommy Sampson, then switched permanently to playing bebop music in 1946 after hearing Dizzy Gillespie. He visited the United States in 1947, then moved to Canada after he was unable to secure a work permit. There he played with Oscar Peterson and Maynard Ferguson before returning to England in 1948. He was one of the early Club Eleven players, along with Ronnie Scott, John Dankworth, Lennie Bush, and others; he also played with many of these musicians on the recordings of Alan Dean's Beboppers.
After Club Eleven shuttered, Shaw played with Vic Lewis and toured Europe with Cab Kaye, then joined Jack Parnell's ensemble in 1953 and Ronnie Scott's nonet in 1954. Shaw played regularly both live and as a session musician for many British jazz musicians over the course of the next twenty or so years, working with Joe Harriott, Tony Crombie, Don Rendell, Tony Kinsey, Stan Tracey, Bill Le Sage, and others. He led a quartet at the 100 Club in the 1960s, and played in the Bebop Preservation Society and the John Burch Quartet for over two decades each. He retired due to ill health in the late 1990s and died in 2006. His wife Jennifer of nearly 50 years survived him, dying in August 2007. Hank Shaw was survived by four of his five children; Lester, Howard, Naomi & Russell.

Love is the third album by Scottish group Aztec Camera, released in November 1987 on the WEA label.
Love was something of a stylistic departure for the group.  Various big-name producers were involved in the recording of the album which, with its radio-friendly hooks and glossy production values was an attempt to break the group in the American market.  It failed to do so, but did become Aztec Camera's most commercially successful album in the United Kingdom, where it reached #10 on the albums chart.  The single "Somewhere in My Heart" was also the group's most successful, peaking at #3.
Inevitably the nature of the album led to some accusations of sell out,[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] and it remains an album which divides opinion.

Eastern Shore District High School is a Canadian public school in the Musquodoboit Harbour area east of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. It is operated by the Halifax Regional School Board (HRSB).
Eastern Shore District High School opened to students in September 1965. The two student populations were combined to form the new school, the first were those from Robert Jamieson High School in Oyster Pond,: the second were those students who lived in the communities of Lake Echo, Porters Lake and Chezzetcook who had been attending Graham Creighton High School. The arrival of the 600 students essentially doubled the population of Musquodoboit Harbour. Musquodoboit Harbour in 1965 was being viewed as a viable alternative to city living. The following quote ran in the Dartmouth Daily Press on July 8, 1965 once the residence of the people who were born there who did business in the district, the Harbour is now largely an outpost of commuters ? navy people, Dalhousie professors, businessmen, shipyard workers. It has also become a favorite place for retirement, and probably one of the reasons has been, besides the well-settled, well-serviced village, the hospital itself which has been open since 1949. In 1979, a junior high school opened in Gaetz Brook. From that point on Eastern Shore High was used for grades ten to twelve, with grades seven, eight and nine attending Gaetz Brook Junior High.Social Anchors of Community: Church, Rink and School in Post War Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia - written by Cindy Kiley

[[Women in the California Gold Rush]]

CATEGORIES: People of the California Gold Rush, California Gold Rush, Pre-statehood history of California, History of women in California

Women in California Gold Rush were scarce but played an important role. Some of the first people in the mining fields were wives and families who were already in California. A few women and kids and the few men who didn't leave there family worked right alongside the men but most men left their wives and families home. The number of women in California changed very quickly as the rich gold strikes and lack of women created strong pressures to restore sex balance. As travel arrangements improved and were made easier and more predictable the number of women coming to California  rapidly increased. Most women probably came by way of Panama as this was one of the fastest trips (40–90 days) and one of the most reliable—although expensive in 1850--$400–$600/person one-way. Passage via Panama became much more predictable after the paddle wheel steam ship lines were up and running by late 1849. In Ireland, the Great Potato Famine was a period of mass starvation, disease and emigration between 1845 and 1852 that drove many desperate women to the United States and on to California.
Women of many different countries, statuses, classes, and races were involved in the California Gold Rush.  The rapidly increasing population had very few women in it and what women there were found myriads of opportunities. As word of the gold rush spread so did the word of opportunities for women to work in the women poor gold fields and communities.
Women going to California to rejoin their families usually had their passages paid for by miners or businessmen who had decided to make California their new home. Most of the male Argonauts had originally planned on getting their gold and returning home to rejoin their families and enjoy their new riches.Richards, Benjamin; "California Gold Rush Merchant--the Journal of Stephen Chapin Davis"; Henry E. Huntington Library; 1956 Typically women euphemistically labeled as entertainers had little or no money for passage but as soon as they showed up in California they were hired by various saloons, gambling halls, dance halls, peep shows and/or brothels. The cost of passage was typically paid for by the entertainer agreeing to work for the payees for at least three to six months. These ’’entertainers’’ initially were the majority of the female population.Chidsey, Donald Barr; “The California Gold Rush”; p. 90; Crown Publishers; ASIN: B0006BW9JI Very few of these ’’entertainers’’ made the five- to six-month trip by wagon on the California Trail or chose the five- to seven-month all sea journey around Cape Horn.
As the gold mining and associated businesses prospered, many men decided to make California their new home and many husbands or potential husbands sent money back to their original homes for their women and families to join them. Others went back east to wind up their business there and escort their women and families to California. Many single men started communicating with female acquaintances they knew and many proposals were accepted with this long distance dating. Some communities back east were severely -60 days for a letter to go from California via Panama to a city in the east and another 40-60 days for a reply so this was ’slow’ courting.  If these long distance proposals were accepted, the prospective groom if a successful miner or businessman sent money for passage and spending money. Usually as soon as the prospective bride got off the ship they were rushed to a preacher to get married. Most single women in California quickly had several proposals for marriage.[tpl]Harvnb|Moynihan|Armitage|Fischer Dichamp|1990|pp=3–8[/tpl]  As time went on the ever increasing immigration of more women and families started changing the composition of the female population and the entertainers soon became outnumbered.
There were many unusual opportunities for women in the cities and gold fields as men, starved for female company, paid extravagant fees to associate with women or buy products that were made by women. There are several stories of women making more money selling home made pies, doughnuts, etc. than their husbands made mining. Laundrys, Restaurants, lodging, mending, waiting tables, all paid good wages.
These entertainers were joined by a few women (less than 3% of initial travelers) who came either overland via the California Trail or by sea with their husbands and families. They refused to be left behind to fend for themselves or miss an exciting life changing opportunity. A few of these travelers became widows as their husbands died of disease or were killed. On the California Trail, about 4% of the people on the trail died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California.  On the sea voyage via Panama there were the usual hazards of traveling across the Isthmus of Panama by canoe and mule, waiting in disease prevalent Chagres and Panama City, where cholera and yellow fever often took a dreadful toll—up to 30% of some groups of travelers.  The final step was catching a paddle wheel steam ship for the 15-20 day trip to California. See Ulysses S. Grant's biography for a vivid description of the hazards of crossing Panama.
The sex imbalance in California (indeed in most of the West) would persist though several generations as the number of females gradually increased to something roughly equivalent to the numbers of males.

Henry Garfield "Gar" Pardy is former diplomat in the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs. Although he retired as director general of the consular affairs bureau in 2003, but has maintained a strong presence in the department.Centre for International Governance Innovation, International Consular Laws Needed: Gar Pardy, September 27, 2006
When Foreign Affairs began making press statements on the Omar Khadr case through Pardy in 2002, legal adviser Colleen Swords sent him an eMail telling him to "claw back on the fact Omar is a minor" in his statements on the case.Michelle Shephard, "Guantanamo's Child", 2008. The same year, he was considered instrumental in seeking consular services for Maher Arar as he was detained in a Syrian prison. He was called to testify before the Royal Commission investigating the matter on October 24, 2005Arar Commission - Policy Review
After that, Pardy became notable for his "sharp" rebukes to Canadians held by foreign governments pleading for Canadian assistance.Abraham, George. Khaleej Times, Canadians pleading innocence far away from home are on their own,
Pardy recently organized a letter from more than 100 former ambassadors criticizing the Harper government for attacking the credibility of diplomat Richard Colvin, who says he warned the government in 2006 about torture.http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ip33hphpRTdemTrPqofhvu12MXbg
In an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC) on April 8, 2010, Pardy was interviewed regarding the case of Nazia Quazi, a dual Indian and Canadian citizen who, after visiting her father in Saudi Arabia, was unable to return to Canada, since her father was able to assume “guardianship” over her and block her exit from the country, in accordance with Islamic law and tradition. Pardy suggested that Canadian policy toward Israel was to blame for Ms. Quazi's situation. Pardy argued that "the fact that we Canada have taken ourselves out as a balanced observer the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... is not looked at with any degree of friendliness in Saudi Arabia.” When the host directly asked him "Are you suggesting that Canada’s Israel policy could leave young Canadian women in limbo?", Mr. Pardy replied "Yes."Who’s to blame for a Canadian woman trapped in Saudi Arabia? Israel, of course! by Jonathan Kay, National Post, April 8, 2010.The Current, CBC, hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti, April 8, 2010.
Pardy was subsequently criticized for his comments by Jonathan Kay in the National Post who wrote rhetorically that "when a repressive Arab Muslim theocracy seizes a Canadian citizen under cover of blatantly misogynistic Wahabi Islamic rules governing women, the real villain can be traced back to … Israel."
In August 2011, Pardy sharply criticized the Canadian government for issuing a press release which he claimed "could have been issued by the Foreign Ministry of the government of Israel without changes" while adding that "The only thing missing was a background chorus of “Hava Nagila”."Tone Deaf Foreign Policy on Israel by Gar Pardy, Prism Magazine, August 3, 2011.

[[Disc shedding]]
CATEGORIES: Eye, Histology, Photoreceptor cells

The retina contains two types of photoreceptor – rod cells and cone cells. There are about 6-7 million cones that provide color vision to the eye, and they are very concentrated in a central spot in the retina, called the macula. However, the rods are much more numerous – they weigh in at about 120 million – and are also more sensitive than the cones. These rods are responsible for scotopic (night) vision, our most sensitive motion detection, and our peripheral vision.
	Vertebrate photoreceptors are composed of a photosensitive outer segment, an inner segment that contains the cell’s metabolic machinery (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, ribosomes, mitochondria), and a synaptic terminal at which contacts with second-order neurons of the retina are made. The photosensitive outer segment is connected to the inner segment by a modified, nonmotile cilium, and consists of a series of discrete membranous discs that are apparently derived from the plasma membrane in the region of the connecting cilium.Besharse, J.C., & Pfenninger, K.H.

It was introduced in the United States in 1987.Brandom heads Disklavier marketing, Music Trades, July 1, 2007
The various forms of Disklavier are essentially modern pianos that use electromechanical solenoids and optical sensors connected to LEDs allowing them to play notes and use the pedals independently of any human operator. Most models are based upon real acoustic pianos and have been engineered such that the sensors and electromechanical elements do not interfere with or affect the normal playing of the instrument. They include the ability to store data, including performance data played by a human pianist, and then use that data to replay / reproduce the performance. Disklaviers also have inputs for data from MIDI and from several storage devices including floppy disks, CD-ROM, serial cables, and USB.
Disklaviers have been manufactured in the form of upright, baby grand, and grand piano styles (including a nine-foot concert grand), along with a product aimed at the professional market called the Disklavier Pro. There is also a digital piano version from Yamaha's 'GranTouch' range. It is claimed by the manufacturer that the Disklavier Pro is able to reproduce key and pedal strokes with greater precision than the standard Disklavier instrument.  It is the official instrument of the Minnesota International Piano-e-Competition, which by 2009 was in its 6th year.

The Unvanquished ([tpl]lang-fr|L'Insoumis[/tpl], literally "Missing without leave")http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058232/ is a 1964 film noir directed by Alain Cavalier and starring Alain Delon opposite Lea Massari.[tpl]cite web|author=Neil Coffey |url=http://www.french-linguistics.co.uk/dictionary/ |title=French Dictionary |publisher=French-linguistics.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-07[/tpl]filmsdefrance.com Quote: It also features Alain Delon at his near best, bringing pathos and humanity to a typically hard man role. and It was Alain Delon’s first real taste of failure. and The experience was not an entirely happy one – Delon sustained a number of physical injuries whilst making the film, the censors insisted on a number of cuts which compromised the film’s artistic integrity, and, on its release, the film received a distinctly lukewarm reception.  It was Alain Delon’s first real taste of failure. The film’s subject matter may have been to blame for its less than stunning box office receipts.  The Algerian War had dragged on for so long that virtually everyone in France was fed up with it and the outcome of the conflict was a humiliating defeat for a proud nation. The film's background is the Algerian War and Alain Delon plays Thomas Vlassenroot, a deserter of the French Foreign Legion in Algeria during the 1961 uprising.New York Times review Quote: In this drama that alludes to the Algerian War with France of the 1960s, Thomas (Alain Delon) is a deserter from the French Foreign Legion who is on the run from authorities. When a former lieutenant who now works for the OAS proposes to him to kidnap lawyer Dominique Servet (played by Massari), who is in Algiers to defend some Algerian nationalists, Thomas agrees. However Thomas falls in love with Dominique and helps her escape back to France. In doing so he comes into inevitable conflict with his OAS colleagues who subsequently hunt them down. The film was not a completely happy experience for Alain Delon. He sustained physical injuries while filming and the reception of the picture by the French public was not good probably because it reminded the French of their defeat in the Algerian war while the censors insisted on a number of cuts which compromised the artistic integrity of the film. Alain Delon along with Georges Beaume were the two producers of the film. Despite Alain Delon's great performance, the film is considered his first failure.

[[Turned chair]]

CATEGORIES: Early oak furniture, History of furniture, Chairs

Turned or thrown chairs are an early form of armchair, made by turners with the use of a lathe, rather than by joiners or carpenters. They are of European origin, travelling to the Americas with European colonists, then developing somewhat independently there.
The earliest turned chairs are of uncertain date, but they became common in the 17th century. Before this date there are rare examples that claim to date back to before 1300,'King Stephen's Throne', c.1300, Hereford Cathedral but most of these early examples are from manuscripts.Romance of Alexander, c.1340, (MS Bodley 264, f.68v, Bodleian library, Oxford)
The characteristics of a turned chair are that the frame members are turned cylindrical on a lathe. The main uprights are usually heavier and plainly turned, the lighter spindles infilling between them are more decoratively turned, often with repeated bobbin turning, so as to appear as a series of balls, beads or bails. The complexity of this turning varies widely, and is used as a guide to identifying the region of origin. Some chairs have so many spindles that their backs and sides form an almost solid latticework, akin to the Arabic lattice windows or Mashrabiya. Eighteenth century turned chairs became far simpler. Eventually their techniques influenced the celebratedly simple and elegant style of the Shaker chair, still largely made by turning.
Three-legged chairs are common, particularly for older examples. The evolution of the chair is from the simple backless stool, commonly three-legged for stability. As there is no wide back, there is no reason to have more than one rear leg. These gave rise to the backstool, a backless stool with one leg extended upwards and later widened by a flat pad. As this pad developed further and wider it began to be supported by diagonal spindles for strength. These gave rise to the arms of the three-legged turned chair (illustrated). In time the turned chair gained a fourth leg and a square plan, becoming closer to the modern chair. Its evolution is through these three-legged stools though, not from the square chest and the throne-like box chairs. 
Seats are commonly solid, but these are often replacements and their original material is uncertain. For later examples, especially from America, a rush seat is common.
Most turned chairs are of ash, but they are also found in fruitwoods and American specimens may use hickory, cherry and maple. Use of oak itself is relatively rare, but their age and relatively simple style means that they are normally counted as part of the "Age of Oak" furniture.

[[IPTC Information Interchange Model]]
CATEGORIES: Metadata

The Information Interchange Model (IIM) is a file structure and set of metadata attributes that can be applied to text, images and other media types. It was developed in the early 1990s by the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) to expedite the international exchange of news among newspapers and news agencies.
The full IIM specification includes a complex data structure and a set of metadata definitions.
Although IIM was intended for use with all types of news items — including simple text articles — a subset found broad worldwide acceptance as the standard embedded metadata used by news and commercial photographers. Information such as the name of the photographer, copyright information and the caption or other description can be embedded either manually or automatically.
IIM metadata embedded in images are often referred to as "IPTC headers", and can be easily encoded and decoded by most popular photo editing software.
The Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) has largely superseded IIM's file structure, but the IIM image attributes are defined in the IPTC Core schema for XMP and most image manipulation programs keep the XMP and non-XMP IPTC attributes synchronized.
Because of its nearly universal acceptance among photographers — even amateurs — this is by far IPTC's most widely used standard. On the other hand, the use of IIM structure and metadata for text and graphics is mainly limited to European news agencies.

[[Rod Morgan]]
CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing (living people), Living people, British civil servants, British criminologists

Rod Morgan is Professor Emeritus, University of Bristol and Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics, the University Police Science Institute, University of Cardiff and the University of Sussex. He is the former chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (2004-7) and prior to that was HM Chief Inspector of Probation for England and Wales (2001-4).
He is the author of many books and articles on criminal justice and penal policy and is co-editor (with Mike Maguire and Robert Reiner) of the influential Oxford Handbook of Criminology (5th Ed, 2012, Oxford University Press). He is a regular advisor to Amnesty International and the Council of Europe on custodial conditions and standards with particular reference to the prevention of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, being co-author (with Malcolm Evans) of the Council of Europe’s official guide to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture (Preventing Torture in Europe, Strasbourg, Council of Europe, 2001). He frequently acts as an expert witness in extradition proceedings in which there is a possible breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Fundamental Human Rights, which forbids torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
He has held almost every post it is possible to hold part-time within the criminal justice system, locally (magistrate, member of a police authority, chairman of a local authority crime and disorder partnership, etc.), nationally (Parole Board, inspector, member of government advisory committee, government advisor) and internationally (ad hoc advisor to the Council of Europe, UN, ICRC, etc.).  He was an Assessor to Lord Justice Woolf's Inquiry into the 1990 prison disturbances and was until 2011 a Ministry of Justice-appointed advisor to the criminal justice inspectorates for England and Wales.
He is currently a trustee of or advisor to several organisations concerned with criminal justice research and policy (Police Foundation, Centre for Crime and Justice Studies) or working with young people in trouble (Dance United, Mentoring Plus, Bath, Catch 22). He was a member of the Centre for Social Justice Working Parties on imprisonment and youth justice and sits on the academic advisory board for Cumberland Lodge, Windsor.
He is a regular broadcaster, speaker and writer on all the above topics.
His other interests include walking, sailing and live music. He is Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Bath Philharmonia and is a Trustee on the Bath Festivals Board.
In has been awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of Bath (Doctor of Laws, 2007) and the West of England (Doctor of Laws 2005).
His Time as Chairman of the Youth Justice Board 
Morgan took up office as Chairman of the YJB in April 2004 following the departure of the founder Chairman, Lord Warner, in summer 2003 and the temporary interregnum of Sir Charles Pollard.  He demonstrated his conspicuous independence by questioning, mostly behind the scenes but occasionally in public, the wisdom of the Government’s anti-social behaviour policy as it impacted youth. He also made it clear that he considered his role to include representing to Government the front-line operational experience of youth offending team (YOT) practitioners and argued that the YJB should adopt a less directive and a more supportive stance than hitherto. He argued that the strength of the reformed youth justice system lay in the YOTs being devolved, multi-agency, locally accountable agencies. He also argued strongly for less reliance by the courts on custody for children and young people. In January 2007 Morgan resigned his office on the grounds that the Government was doing insufficient to reverse two trends about which he was unhappy: the greatly increased criminalisation of children and young people; and the continuing growth in the number of children and young people in custody. Since his departure from the Board Morgan has critically described both trends in some detail in newspaper articles, broadcasts and in articles and contributions to books.
His Time as HM Chief Inspector of Probation
Morgan became the first Chief Inspector of Probation not to have a career background in probation. He oversaw the transition from an inspectorate which functioned as an arm of the Home Office in relation to more or less autonomous, local probation services, to an independent inspectorate of a national probation service managed by a National Probation Directorate within the Home Office (later to become part of a National Offender Management Service within a Ministry of Justice). He argued for and introduced the joint inspection of youth offending teams (YOTs), arrangements which were to be led by HM Inspectorate of Probation. In his annual reports he expressed doubts about placing too much reliance on cognitive behavioural programmes for offenders and argued against the ‘sentencing drift’ which he maintained was serving to ‘silt up’ probation caseloads. He suggested that approximately one third of all offenders being supervised by the Probation Service did not need the attention of the Service and in former times would have been dealt with by less intrusive methods. In 2003-4 he chaired the Criminal Justice Chief Inspectors Group yet argued publicly for the amalgamation of the five criminal justice inspectorates to form a single Criminal Justice Inspectorate. This idea was pursued by the Government but in 2006 abandoned in the face of Parliamentary opposition.

Red & White stores were independent grocery stores in small towns. The company did centralized buying and distribution for the small stores to allow them to compete against large chains that were consolidating their power in the 1920s. All members of this group had the words Red & White as part of their names, usually with the owner's name or town name as well.  The firm started around 1925.

Anand was the defending champion, having gained the title in 2007 and defended it in 2008 (against Vladimir Kramnik) and in 2010 (against Veselin Topalov). Boris Gelfand became the challenger in 2012 after winning the eight-player 2011 Candidates Tournament.

The match conditions called for twelve games to be played with classical time control. If a player scored at least 6½ points, he would be declared the winner and the match ended. By the end of the twelve games, however, the match was tied at 6 points each, so four rapid games were played in order to produce a result. Anand won the rapid-game playoff with a win in the second game and draws in the other three games.

[[Epistemocracy]]
CATEGORIES: Epistemology, Political neologisms, Skepticism

The term  epistemocracy has many conflicting uses, generally designating someone of rank having some epistemic property or other. Nassim Nicholas Taleb used it in 2007 to designate a utopian type of society where the leadership possesses epistemic humility. He claims the French writer Michel de Montaigne was a modern epistemocrat. He points out, however, that it is difficult to assert authority on the basis of one's uncertainty; leaders who are assertive, even if they are incorrect, still gather people together.[tpl]Cite book |last= Taleb |first= Nassim Nicholas |authorlink= Nassim Nicholas Taleb |title= The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable |chapter= Epistemocracy, a Dream |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-1-4000-6351-2 |pages= 190–192 |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-04-29[/tpl]
However the term had already been used long before this, and as of 2010 Taleb's usage has not caught on. Most uses of the word are unrelated or even opposite to this. For instance in reference to communism: "Maoism, like the Marxist- Leninist system upon which it modeled itself, was an `epistemocracy,' rule by those possessed of that infallible wisdom embodied in the `universal truth of Marxism'"Marxism, China, and Development: Reflections on Theory and Reality by A. Gregor, 1999 Or theocracy: "The model for this concentration of knowledge in the hands of a single group is the epistemocracy of the Old Testament priests..." J. R. Simpson. Animal body, literary corpus: the old French "Roman de Renart". Editions Rodopi B.V., Amsterdam
Another use seems to be in relation to modern science or western technocracy: "...the social promotion and political em-powerment of a new class of experimental scientists ... what sociologists of science like Blumenberg call an epistemocracy."José María Rodrígez García. "Scientia Potestas Est – Knowledge is Power: Francis Bacon to Michel Foucault"http://www.akademiai.com/content/u495611628627323/ Neohelicon Volume 28, Number 1 / January, 2001. Akadémiai Kiadó. Again this is more or less opposite to Taleb's use. However it would be unfair to say that any of these have exactly caught on either. It remains a word used in an ad hoc manner.

Hippocrates can be seen as the father of lifestyle medicine. He often used lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to treat diseases such as diabetes, what is today called lifestyle medicine. He is often quoted with "Let food be your medicine, and medicine be your food" and "Walking is man's best medicine".[tpl]cite book|last=Hakim|first=Chishti|title=The Traditional Healer's Handbook|date=1988|publisher=Vermont: Healing Arts Press|isbn=0892814381|page=11[/tpl] 
Lifestyle medicine is often prescribed in conjunction with a typical medicine approach of pharmacotherapy. For example, diabetic patients who may be on medication to help control the blood glucose levels in the short term might also be prescribed a lifestyle intervention of a healthy diet and exercise to assist in the long term management of their pathology. In some cases lifestyle interventions are more effective when augmented with appropriate pharmacotherapy, as with tobacco use where medications such as bupropion may be prescribed to assist the patient to quit smoking and adopt a healthy lifestyle change.
The Australian Lifestyle Medicine Association (ALMA) has been set up by representatives of professions involved in the field under the auspices of Southern Cross University. It is intended to represent the 14 disciplines eligible for medical benefits under the Enhanced Primary Care (EPC) system.
The European Society of Lifestyle Medicine (ESLM) provides leadership in research, prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases through interventions that integrate nutrition, physical activity, psychology and public health. ESLM represents all nations in Europe and around the Mediterranean, and is a founding member of the Global Lifestyle Medicine Alliance (GLMA). ESLM is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious, scientific and medical organization.
The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) provides leadership and assistance, facilitating lifestyle medicine clinicians' pursuits of continuing medical education, practice knowledge, leadership skills, and research information needed to provide quality patient care and best counsel patients with respect to lifestyle-related diseases.

[[Pinchot Sycamore]]

CATEGORIES: Individual trees, Platanaceae, Simsbury, Connecticut

The Pinchot Sycamore is a large American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in Simsbury, Connecticut.  It is the largest tree in Connecticut.  When measured by the Connecticut Botanical Society in 2010, the Pinchot Sycamore was almost 28 feet around and 104 feet tall, with an average canopy diameter of 147 feet.  The sycamore is estimated to be at least 200 years old, and possibly over 300 years old.Steve Grant, "In The Shade Of The Sycamore", Hartford Courant, April 13, 2000.  Accessed April 30, 2008.  The tree was named in honor of influential conservationist and Connecticut resident Gifford Pinchot.  It was originally dedicated to Pinchot in 1965, and re-dedicated with an engraved stone marker in 1975.
The Pinchot Sycamore is located on the east bank of the Farmington River, near the base of Talcott Mountain, south of the town center of Simsbury.  Since the completion of the Pinchot Sycamore Lighting Project by the town in 1997, the tree is lit by floodlights at night.  The Pinchot Sycamore Park surrounds the tree; the park includes a launching point onto the Farmington River for small boats.  It is a popular area for canoeing.
According to the conservation group American Forests in 2000, the Pinchot Sycamore was scheduled to be listed in the 2001 edition of the National Register of Big Trees as one of the two largest known American sycamores in the United States, tied with a tree in Bath County, Virginia.  In the 2008-2009 edition, a larger tree in Ashland, Ohio is listed as the champion American sycamore.American Forests, "National Register of Big Trees 2008-2009", p. 38.  Accessed April 30, 2008.
In 2005, a guitar made from a fallen bough of the Pinchot Sycamore was auctioned off by the Farmington River Watershed Association.Farmington River Watershed Association, "Pinchot Sycamore Guitar for Auction at Nov. 3rd Annual Meeting", Farmington River News, Fall 2005.  Accessed April 30, 2008. The Pinchot Sycamore sustained some damage to its canopy as a result of storm Alfred (an early snowstorm) in October 2011; however, it was not diminished in size, and its large recognizable lower limbs remain intact.

[[Bridge program (higher education)]]
CATEGORIES: Higher education

A Bridge program is a formal partnership between two post-secondary institutions that provides students with advanced standing in a degree program at one institution as recognition of previous academic experience in a similar field of study at another institution. Typically, a bridge program student holds a two-year college degree, and is seeking advancement in their profession by obtaining a four-year or graduate degree.
Most bridge programs can be categorized into 3 types of agreements:Boggs & Trick, 2009, p.5-8
Bilateral: An agreement outlined between two institutions and two specific programs of similar content. Students are permitted to use some of their initial credits toward the completion of another program at the partner institution. Example: Seneca/York Joint Degrees
Multilateral:  An agreement between one institution and several institutions that offer related programs of interest. The completion of one program will directly lead to a specific degree program. Example: The completion of any Ontario Public College Recreation and Leisure Services Diploma and entrance to Brock University’s Bachelor of Recreation and Leisure Studies
Concurrent: A collaborative agreement between two institutions, whereby students will work toward two sets of qualifications (such as a diploma and a degree) at the same time, and on the same campus. Example: University of Guelph-Humber.

[[Charles A. Hufnagel]]
CATEGORIES: 1916 births, People from Richmond, Indiana, People from Louisville, Kentucky, University of Notre Dame alumni, Harvard Medical School alumni, Georgetown University faculty, 1989 deaths

[tpl]Refimprove|date=April 2008[/tpl]Charles A. Hufnagel, M.D. (August 15, 1916—May 31, 1989) was an American surgeon who in the early 1950s invented the first artificial heart valve.
Dr. Hufnagel was born in Louisville, Kentucky and was reared in Richmond, Indiana.  His father was also a surgeon.  He graduated from the University of Notre Dame and earned his medical degree from Harvard Medical School. At Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, he began work on the heart and other organ transplants and explored the use of plastic to replace blood vessels, developing a technique called multi-point fixation, which would have great importance in the placement of the artificial aortic valve. 

File:Hufnagel heart Valve15111214-photos 309.jpg|Hufnagel Artificial Heart Valve in the collection of the National Museum of Health and Medicine.

In 1950, Dr. Hufnagel joined the Georgetown University faculty as director of the surgical research laboratory and professor of surgery. He became chairman of the department of surgery in 1969 and held the post until 1979.
In September 1952 Dr. Hufnagel, then director of the Georgetown University Medical Center's surgical research laboratory, implanted an aortic "assist" valve into the circulatory system of a 30-year-old woman. The valve consisted of a pea-size ball of plastic inside a chambered tube -- an inch and a half long and an inch thick -- that regulated blood flow through the heart.  The manufactured valve compensated for the faulty original valve, but did not actually replace it, while insuring that the heart was able to pump blood successfully into the body's circulatory system.   
The purpose of the aortic valve is to prevent blood from flowing backward into the heart. In the artificial valve the free-moving plastic pea in the tube was dislodged by the pulsing blood with each heartbeat, then fell back to close the tube between pulses.http://artificialheartvalve.umwblogs.org/antecedents/hufnagels-valve/ 
The first patient to receive the plastic implant had rheumatic fever, which had severely damaged her aortic valve to the point where she was given little chance to live. Shortly after the implant, she was able to resume a normal life and lived for almost a decade with the implanted valve before dying of unrelated causes. The valve itself, however, had some drawbacks, including the fact that it "clicked" loudly enough to be heard by others.  Several hundred other patients subsequently received other "Hufnagel" valves.  http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/139/5/1010.pdf 
Dr. Hufnagel later made significant contributions to the development of the modern heart-lung machine. The principle of the early artificial aortic valve still serves as a model for heart implants. 
In 1974, Dr. Hufnagel served as chairman of a three-member medical panel that evaluated the condition of President Richard M. Nixon, who had undergone pelvic surgery for a chronic phlebitis condition. The evaluation was ordered by Federal Judge John J. Sirica, who was then presiding at the trial of Nixon aides accused of covering up the Watergate break-in, when lawyers for Mr. Nixon asserted that he was too weakened physically to testify. 
The panel determined that Mr. Nixon was too ill to testify for at least six weeks. But the doctors made a point of protecting the confidentiality of the former President's medical records and refused to cite a reason for recommending against his testifying. Mr. Nixon never testified. 
Dr. Hufnagel was a member of more than 75 surgical and academic societies in the United States, Europe and South America. He was the author of more than 400 articles in medical and other scientific journals. 
Among the awards and honors he received were the American Heart Association's distinguished service award in 1969; the Modern Medicine Award, also for distinguished service, in 1961; the James F. Mitchell International Award for heart and vascular research in 1970, the Mendel Medal from Villanova University in 1965, and the John H. Gibbon Medal in 1975.
He died in Washington, D.C on May 31, 1989 at the age of 72.http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/01/obituaries/charles-a-hufnagel-72-surgeon-who-invented-plastic-heart-valve.html

He is best known for West from Fort Bridger: The Pioneering of the Immigrant Trails Across Utah 1846-1850, completed with the assistance of historiographer and author Dale L. Morgan.  Korns is considered a productive collector of historic sources and an avid historian of western trails.
Korns participated in and was featured in a round of correspondence between historians and researchers associated with the American west.  In a 1946 letter to Bernard DeVoto, Korn's friend and collaborator Dale L. Morgan related a story told by Korns.  
Korns’ posthumous 1951 volume  " West from Fort Bridger: The Pioneering of the Immigrant Trails Across Utah 1846-1850", first appeared as Volume XIX of the "Utah Historical Quarterly".  The classic history of the opening of western trails includes primary documents relating immigrant trails including the Hastings Cutoff and the Golden Pass Road into the Salt Lake Valley, with analysis and commentary.  Immigrants personal accounts, compiled from original diaries, journals, maps, and letters, recount a half-decade of historic pioneer treks.  After Korns' death, Morgan went forward with the author's original plans for organization and publication.  Despite his own significant research and editorial contributions, Morgan ascribed primary authorship to his late friend.  The work was awarded the American Association for State and Local History's Award of Merit.  Salt desert historian Charles Kelly pronounced the volume "one of the most important contributions to Utah history ever assembled" (Bagley, p. viii).  Originally produced in a limited edition, the book has been reprinted several times.  A 1994 revised version includes excerpts from primary sources which had not yet been discovered or were  unavailable to the original researchers. 
Korns was the son of William Henry Korns and Roberta Stalcup and attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.  He married Sara Beck Marrill,  granddaughter of the prominent pioneer miner John Beck of the Bullion-Beck Mine in Juab County, Utah, on January 30, 1917.  The couple had two sons.

[[Name of Quebec City]]
CATEGORIES: History of Quebec City, Names of places in Canada

The proper name of Quebec City is Québec (with an acute accent), in both official languages of Canada (English and French). This name is used by both the federal and provincial governments. The acute accent differentiates between the official English name of the city, Québec, and the constitutional English name of the province, Quebec.
In unofficial English texts, it is not uncommon for the accent to be dropped and for Québec to be informally referred to as "Quebec City". In French, names of geographical regions such as provinces and countries are typically preceded by articles whereas city names are not (unless it is part of the name, such as "La Malbaie"). As a result, the province is called le Québec ("in Quebec" = au Québec, "from Quebec" or "of Quebec" = du Québec) while the city remains simply Québec ("in Québec City" = à Québec, "from / of Québec City" = de Québec). Where context requires further differentiation, words such as "la ville de Québec" and "la province du Québec" can be used (taking care not to capitalize the word "ville").
The name of the municipal corporate body instituted to govern Québec is Ville de Québec, in both English and French.Charter of Ville de Québec This naming convention applies to all municipal corporations in the province (e.g. Ville de Montréal is the corporate body governing Montréal, etc.)  Thus, where "Ville de ..." is capitalized, it means the corporate body and it is not part of the toponym (Montréal, Québec), but is the incorporated name of the city. In the English section of Ville de Québec's official website, the city is variously referred to as "Québec" and "Québec City" (with an accent) whereas the corporate body is referred to as "City of Québec".
Residents of Québec are called, in French, Québécois (male) or Québécoise (female). To avoid confusion with Québécois/e meaning an inhabitant of the province, the term Québécois/e de Québec for residents of the city is sometimes used. In English, the terms Quebecer (or Quebecker) and Québécois/e are common.
Also, Quebec City is sometimes referred to as "la capitale nationale" ("the national capital"). The government officially named it this way under the Union Nationale party. The provincial administrative region where the city is situated bears the name Capitale-Nationale (capitalized). The word national is the adjective for the noun nation used in its normal basic sense and refers to Quebec as a nation within the country of Canada, and has no indication of sovereignty.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/11/27/nation-vote.html | title=House passes motion recognizing Québécois as nation | work=CBC.ca | accessdate=2007-03-24 | date=2006-11-27[/tpl]

[[Submarine landslide]]
CATEGORIES: Physical oceanography, Plate tectonics, Landslides

Submarine landslides are marine landslides that transport sediment across the continental shelf and into the deep ocean. A submarine landslide is initiated when the downwards driving stress (gravity and other factors) exceeds the resisting stress of the seafloor slope material causing movements along one or more concave to planar rupture surfaces. Submarine landslides take place in a variety of different settings including planes as low as 1° and can cause significant damage to both life and property. Recent advances have been made in understanding the nature and processes of submarine landslides through the use of sidescan sonar and other seafloor mapping technology.Hampton, M & Locat, J (1996) Submarine landslides.

Lomas del Mirador is a locality of the La Matanza partido in Greater Buenos Aires. Located outside Buenos Aires along the southwest edge of the General Paz Freeway, the city has a population of 51,488 (INDEC, 2001).
The land where Lomas del Mirador is located was sold by Ezequiel Ramos Mexía to Pablo Pelluse in 1868. The ranch at the site was known as Terrenos del Mirador ("the lookout property") in reference to the estancia therein, Mirador Santa Lucía. A neighboring property was owned by the descendants of Governor Manuel Dorrego, a key figure in the Argentine Civil Wars of the 19th century, and the city shield would include a red lookout tower in reference to both the town's name and that family's allegiance to the Federalists during the civil wars.
These properties were later sold, and in 1909, the first lots were parceled to investors and homesteaders. It would later be home to a diversified base of light industry, notably the former Jabón Federal ("Federal Soap") facility. The Provincial Legislature declared Lomas del Mirador a city in 1984.

CATEGORIES: Armenian culture, Armenian unisex given names

During the late nineteenth century rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire, the word "Nairi" or "Nayiri" (Armenian: Նայիրի in TAO or Նաիրի in RAO) came to be used as a synonym for Armenia among Armenians who came to see the Nairi (see also Mitanni, better known to Armenians as Aram-Naharin), a people located in the wider area of the Armenian Highlands during the Late Bronze Age, as their remote ancestors.
In 1916, Vahan Terian published a collection of poems entitled Land of Nairi ([tpl]lang-hy|Yerkir Nairi[/tpl]), in which he used Nairi in place of Armenia. Likewise in 1923, Yeghishe Charents wrote a satirical novella entitled Land of Nairi, using Nairi as a synonym for Armenia. Another writer, Hayastan Yeghiazarian, used Nairi Zarian as his pen-name, replacing his first name, Hayastan (the Armenian word for Armenia since the Late Middle Ages) with Nairi.

"...My Huckleberry Friend": Johnny Mercer Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer is an album by singer/composer Johnny Mercer, released in 1974. 
Recorded just two years before his death, ...My Huckleberry Friend features, by and large, updated, funky arrangements of most of Mercer's most popular tunes as interpreted by the author himself. The instrumentation relies heavily (but not exclusively) on a flute-lead horn section, electric piano and funk/R&B-tinged percussion. Some of the songs, however, such as "One For My Baby", "Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home" and "Midnight Sun" feature more classic arrangements in the ballad style.
The album's title comes from the song responsible for relaunching Mercer's career, "Moon River".

The term and concepts were first published in September 1993 in a conference paperWilliam Harrison and Harold Ossher, Subject-Oriented Programming - A Critique of Pure Objects, Proceedings of 1993 Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, and Applications, September 1993 which was later recognized as being one of the three most influential papers to be presented at the conference between 1986 and 1996.[tpl]brokenlink|date=May 2013[/tpl]http://www.sigplan.org/award-oopsla.htm As illustrated in that paper, an analogy is made with the contrast between the philosophical views of Plato and Kant with respect to the characteristics of “real” objects, but applied to software ones. For example, while we may all perceive a tree as having a measurable height, weight, leaf-mass, etc., from the point of view of a bird, a tree may also have measures of relative value for food or nesting purposes, or from the point of view of a tax-assessor, it may have a certain taxable value in a given year. Neither the bird’s nor the tax-assessor’s additional state information need be seen as intrinsic to the tree, but are added by the perceptions of the bird and tax-assessor, and from Kant’s analysis, the same may be true even of characteristics we think of as intrinsic.
Subject-oriented programming advocates the organization of the classes that describe objects into “subjects”, which may be composed to form larger subjects. At points of access to fields or methods, several subjects’ contributions may be composed. These points were characterized as the join-pointsHarold Ossher ,  Peri Tarr. Operation-Level Composition: A Case in (Join) Point, in ECOOP ’98 Workshop Reader, 406–409 of the subjects. For example, if a tree is cut-down, the methods involved may need to join behavior in the bird and tax-assessor’s subjects with that of the tree’s own. It is therefore fundamentally a view of the compositional nature of software development, as opposed to the algorithmic (procedural) or representation-hiding (object) nature.

[[Combat sidestroke]]
CATEGORIES: Swimming styles, United States Navy SEALs, Armed forces diving

Combat side stroke or CSS is a variation of the side stroke that was developed by and taught to the United States Navy SEALs.
The Combat Swimmer Stroke is a relaxing and very efficient swim stroke that is an updated version of the traditional sidestroke. The CSS is a mix of sidestroke, freestyle and breaststroke. The combat side stroke allows the swimmer to swim more efficiently and reduce the body's profile in the water in order to be less likely to be seen during combat operations if surface swimming is required. The concept of CSS has been that it can be used with or without wearing swim fins (flippers), the only difference being that when wearing swim fins the swimmer's legs will always be kicking in the regular flutter kick motion without the scissor kick. This stroke is one of the strokes that can be used for prospective SEAL candidates in the SEAL Physical Screening Test (PST), which includes a 500 yard swim in 12 minutes 30 seconds to determine if the candidate is suitable to go to the Basic Underwater Demolitions/SEAL school.

[[Wooramel Seagrass Bank]]

CATEGORIES: Protected areas of Western Australia, Seagrass, Shark Bay

Wooramel Seagrass Bank is a large deposit of carbonate sediment, a sand bank, formed by diverse communities of seagrasses off the coast of Carnarvon, Western Australia. The mattes of seagrass meadows and stands consolidate a shallow platform of sandy substrate by acting as an organic baffle against currents and tides. These colonies provide food and shelter to many of the species within the Shark Bay Marine Park.
The bank occurs in the eastern most bay of the Shark Bay World Heritage area. It is a structure 129 kilometres long and around 8 kilometres wide, comprising various communities on sand plains, tidal channels and other coastal habitats.[tpl]Citation | author1=Bird, S. A | author2=University of Western Australia. Dept. of Geology.

The space taken up is 1030 km², making it the largest seagrass bank in the world.[tpl]Citation | author1=Considine, Mary-Lou | title=Is Shark Bay shifting from temperate to tropical? | journal=ECOS | publication-date=2013 | publisher=CSIRO PUBLISHING | volume=2013 | issue=182 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/180664337 | accessdate=30 December 2013 [/tpl] The only other comparable structure is found in the Mediterranean.
Shark Bay has the largest number of seagrass species recorded in one area.
Twelve species have been identified in the area, with nine species being found in some locations. The stands or meadows usually comprise one to four species of seagrass. 
The marine fauna associated with the bank - including fish, crustaceans and echinoderms - are diverse and numerous. These indirectly contribute to the forming of the bank; the baffle effect of the seagrass communities trap the carbonate deposits of their organisms remains.
The endangered Dugong, represented by one of largest remaining populations (over 500 individuals), forages along the Wooramel bank. 
The area was first documented in 1970,[ref]Davies, G.R. 1970 A Recent Seagrass Bank, Shark Bay, Western Australia. In Logan et al. 'Carbonate Sedimentation And Environments, Shark Bay, W.A.' American Association of Petroleum Geol 'Memoir 13: 85-168.
[/ref] with several studies and applications for environmental protection since that time.
The Register of the National Estate at the Australian Heritage Database describes this natural feature as "internationally significant" for its seagrass diversity, associated marine life, and as "worldwide benchmark for research" into these structures.[tpl]cite AHD|10785|Wooramel Seagrass Bank, Carnarvon, WA, Australia[/tpl]

[[Imperial Bedrooms]]
CATEGORIES: 2010 novels, Alfred A. Knopf books, Metafictional works, Novels by Bret Easton Ellis, Novels set in Los Angeles, California, Sequel novels, Hollywood novels

Imperial Bedrooms is a novel by American author Bret Easton Ellis. Released on June 15, 2010, it is the sequel to Less Than Zero, Ellis' 1985 bestselling literary debut, which was shortly followed by a film adaptation in 1987. Imperial Bedrooms revisits Less Than Zeros self-destructive and disillusioned youths as they approach middle-age in the present day. Like Ellis' earlier novel, which took its name from Elvis Costello's 1977 song of the same name, Imperial Bedrooms is named after Costello's 1982 album.
Imperial Bedrooms, unlike Less Than Zero, is plot-driven. The action of the novel takes place twenty-five years after Less Than Zero. Its story follows Clay, a New York-based screenwriter, after he returns to Los Angeles to cast his new film. There, he becomes embroiled in the sinister world of his former friends and confronts the darker aspects of his own personality. The novel opens with a literary device that establishes the world of Imperial Bedrooms to be similar to but not exactly that of Less Than Zero. In doing this, Ellis is able to comment on the earlier novel's style and on the development of its moralistic film adaptation. The device also allows Ellis to explore Clay's pathological narcissism, masochistic and sadistic tendencies, and the exploitative personality, none of which had been explicit in Less Than Zero. Ellis chose to do this in part to dispel the sentimental reputation Less Than Zero has accrued over the years, that of "an artifact of the 1980s". Imperial Bedrooms retains Ellis' characteristic transgressive style and applies it to the 2000s (decade) and 2010s, covering amongst other things, the impact of new communication technologies on daily lives.
Ellis began working on what would become Imperial Bedrooms during the development of his 2005 novel, Lunar Park. As with his previous works, Imperial Bedrooms depicts scenes of sex, extreme violence and hedonism in a minimalist style devoid of emotion. Some commentators have noted however that unlike previous works, Imperial Bedrooms employs more of the conventional devices of popular fiction. Reviews were mixed and frequently polarized. Some reviewers felt the novel was a successful return to themes explored in Less Than Zero, Lunar Park and American Psycho (1991), while others derided it as "boring" or self-indulgent.

[[Vegetation and slope stability]]
CATEGORIES: Geomorphology, Physical geography, Geological processes, Horticulture and gardening, Soil science, Ecological restoration, Environmental terminology

Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.Mattia, C.; Bishetti, G. & Gentile, F. 2005, ‘Biotechnical characteristics of root systems of typical Mediterranean species’, Plant and Soil, vol. 278, no.1, pp. 23-32
There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots.

Gruff Rhys cast doubt over the future of Neon Neon in a 2008 interview for the BBC: "I don't know about making another Neon Neon album because it was quite a specific record about John DeLorean's life story. If we did something in the future it would have to be something different. But it's nice that it did well and we get to play it live."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/neon-neon/40750 |title=Neon Neon to ditch band name | News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]
Neon Neon remixed Oasis's song "To Be Where There's Life" from their Dig Out Your Soul album for inclusion as the B-side of Oasis's single, "I'm Outta Time." However, it was only released on the vinyl copy of the single.
In December 2011, Neon Neon announced the release of a new song from their Stainless Style sessions. The song 'Wheels' is being released as part of the 'Complex' compilation, which celebrates the 10th anniversary of Lex Records. An NME article announcing the release of the song suggested that Neon Neon are to return to the studio in 2012 to record a second album.

James Tubbs (b 1835-d 1921)- one of the most celebrated  English bow makers, and is considered  "The English Tourte".
Together with his son Alfred (d. 1912) they produced more than 5000 bows.
It is universally accepted that James Tubbs  ranks among the five or six most important bow makers in history.Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 
"The Tubbs family made bows and instruments as early as the 1800s, and five generations have practiced the craft." [tpl]cite news | url=http://www.maestronet.com/m_library/world_strings/fall80.pdf |format=PDF| title=The Tubbs Bow | publisher=William Moening & Sons Ltd. | author=Philip J. Kass| year=1980 | accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl]
Born in London, in 1835,  (eldest of eleven children) son of William. James worked for his father until 1860.
James T. first started making bows for William Ebsworth Hill  around 1860 and continued that relationship until 1870. His bows made for  W. E. Hill & Sons are stamped W E Hill and are sometimes double stamped. In the 1870s Tubbs settled on his own opening a  shop at 94 Wardour Street. The early bows from this period were branded "J. TUBBS." Around 1878 he changed this brand to "Jas. TUBBS."
In 1885 he won a Gold medal for his bows at the Inventions Exhibition held that year in London, after which he was made bowmaker by Special Appointment to HRH the Duke of Edinburgh.
The authority, Henley, calls him “this champion” and places him alongside Tourte, Peccatte and Voirin.
"This champion, completely disciplined, stepped forward to challenge the opinion that French bows were the only bows worthy of artists' acceptance, and, he won the day on this field he had entered. To say that he was the equal of Tourte, Peccatte, and Voirin, is not a wild and extravagant hypothesis."Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 -  William Henley
”Intimately acquainted with the minutiae or perfect balance, familiar with the diversified style of celebrated predecessors, trained by long study of all the laws, wisely assimilated suggestions from various violinists, brought a refined and mature tact in seizing all the bearings couched under strength and elasticity, imbued with a sincere love of artistry and profound reverence for its dictates, and withal, endowed with a natural gift of manipulative skill. Possessed every qualification peculiarly fitting him to produce everything replete with perfection.” Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 
Typical characteristics are:  Head is broad and full, the model being an early work of Francois Tourte. The frog with pearl eyes and long ferrule 
and one piece long buttons with solid metal (ex: silver ) are also typical of this period. Finest examples have metal fittings of engraved gold.
World Record Auction Price: Sotheby's Mar 21, 1995	$43,608.00	
Round stick - ebony frog - gold and ebony adjuster - stamped and engraved "Made and presented to Prof. Aug. Wilhelmj by James Tubbs 1885" on the gold slide and "A.W." on the ferrule.
String players generally regard his bows as extremely desirable, and will often go to great lengths to obtain one and collectors may pay huge amounts to own one.
"Leading musicians of the day such as Piatti and Wilhelmj, were attracted by  bows made by James Tubbs and were using them. Since then, his bows have been enjoyed and used by  musicians (soloists, chamber musicians and orchestral players) the world over." Filimonov Fine Violins

The International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA) is the global trade association for the modern trade and barter industry.http://books.google.com/books?id=SYbBxpqxx8MC&pg=PA87&dq=%22International+Reciprocal+Trade+Association%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bzsDT-bJDMXe0QHGtrC4Ag&sqi=2&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22International%20Reciprocal%20Trade%20Association%22&f=false  IRTA claims to promote proper accountability rules, equitable standards, ethics and governmental relations, for the organized barter industry an its participating trade exchanges. Its members are situated in Australia, Canada, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sardinia, Spain, Singapore, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. IRTA's home office is in Portsmouth, Virginia.  The president is Annette Riggs and the Executive Director is Ron Whitney.
IRTA estimates that the 400,000 participating businesses transacted $12 billion globally in 2009/2010 — and it is anticipated that the trade volume will grow another 5 to 10% in 2011 and 2012.
A barter exchange acts as a third party record keeper for its participating business clients.  These member businesses buy and sell products and services on a barter basis using trade credits to account for each transaction.  Barter exchanges practice third party bartering, meaning the seller does not have to buy from whom he or she sold to, rather, the seller's account is credited the market value of the sale in trade dollars.  This modern trade and barter method is different than the ancient “direct trade” when people swapped one thing for another. Modern trade and barter has evolved into a sophisticated alternative way for business owners to increase sales and revenue, conserving cash, move inventory, maximize their excess or unused capacity to improve their financial bottom line.
Most trade exchanges are members of international trading networks that provide them with opportunities to access larger, global marketplaces.  IRTA provides its own international clearinghouse platform for member trade exchanges called Universal Currency http://ucci.biz (UC) - UC is the largest industry owned international trading platform in the modern trade and barter industry.
One of IRTA's biggest historical achievements was the adoption of the TEFRA Act in 1982 whereby the IRS recognized trade exchanges as third party record keepers.  IRTA also re-wrote and modernized its Code Ethics and Conduct at the 32nd IRTA International Convention in Riviera Maya, Mexico, a copy of which can be reviewed on IRTA's website at www.irta.com 
IRTA holds international conventions annually in the U.S. and Europe to provide education and networking opportunities for its members and those interested in the modern trade and barter industry.

Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1953 followed a radically new procedure. The institution appointed its Committee on Baseball Veterans, the famous "Veterans Committee", to meet in person and consider pioneers and executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. Committees in the 1930s and 1940s had chosen several pioneers and executives but this was the first direction of anyone's attention to field personnel other than players, the managers and umpires.
The first Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and elected six people: Ed Barrow, Chief Bender, Tommy Connolly, Bill Klem, Bobby Wallace, and Harry Wright.
The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players (no change) and elected two, Dizzy Dean and Al Simmons.

[[By a Waterfall]]
CATEGORIES: 1933 songs, Songs from films

"By a Waterfall" is a 1933 song with music by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Irving Kahal. It was featured in an extravagant choreographic arrangement in the film Footlight Parade by Busby Berkeley that features his trademark human waterfall. It features a crowd of chorus girls diving and swimming into the water in various geometric and floral patterns.
The lyrics of the song use the phrase "I'm calling you - oo-oo-oo" in much the same way as the Indian Love Call from the operetta Rose-Marie does.
Berkeley realized that screen choreography involved the placement and movement of the camera as well as the dancers. Instead of filming numbers from fixed angles, he set his cameras into motion on custom built booms and monorails and if necessary, cut through the studio roof to get the right shot.
Berkeley used a 40 x 80 foot (12.2 x 24.4 meter) swimming pool that filled an entire soundstage.  Its walls and floor were glass, and before shooting started 100 chorus girls took two weeks to practice their routines in it.  The actual filming lasted six days and required 20,000 gallons (75,708 liters) of water a minute to be pumped across the set.Spotlight on James Cagney: Footlight Parade

[[Laidcenn mac Bairchid]]
CATEGORIES: Medieval Irish poets, 5th-century Irish people, Irish Gaelic poets, Medieval Gaels

Laidcenn mac Bairchid, or Laidcenn mac Bairceda, is said to have been an early Irish language poet, whose floruit, if he existed, may have fallen in the middle of the 5th century.
According to later glosses, he belonged to the Cruthin of Dál nAraidi in Ulster, a claim which may well be incorrect. A poem on the Kings of Leinster included in the Corpus genealogiarum Hiberniae is attributed to him, but Kuno Meyer considered the attribution to be certainly false and the poem is dated to the 7th century.
Laidcenn's poem, if indeed it is his, provides a very different list of kings to that contained in the Book of Leinster, probably intended to support the claims of the Uí Bairrche to the primacy in Leinster.

Building 20 (18 Vassar Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts) was a temporary wooden structure hastily erected during World War II on the central campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Since it was always regarded as "temporary", it never received a formal name throughout its 55-year existence.

[[Cernida]]

CATEGORIES: Military history of the Republic of Venice

The cernide or cernida (also known as the cranide in Dalmatia) were territorial armies of the Veneto and Istria that annually received some military training.  The name cernida derives from the fact that the one or two young men were chosen (cerniti, or Italian for selections) for every ten from among the young men resident in these areas.Tratto da: Lino Ertani. La Valle Camonica attraverso la storia. Esine, Tipolitografia Valgrigna, 1996. 168
These units could thus be mobilized quickly, unlike the army, which was slower to recruit and slower moving.  They were formed of soldiers on annual service, with an obligation to gather for brief training periods four times a year, and accounted in total for about 30,000 men.

[[Kink instability]]
CATEGORIES: Plasma physics

A kink instability, also oscillation or mode, is a class of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities which sometimes develop in a thin plasma column carrying a strong axial current. If a "kink" begins to develop in a column the magnetic forces on the inside of the kink become larger than those on the outside, which leads to growth of the perturbation.Plasma Dictionary As it develops at fixed areas in the plasma, kinks belong to the class of "absolute plasma instabilities", as opposed to convective processes. The kink instability was first widely explored in the Z-pinch fusion power machines in the 1950s.

[[Quakers Hill Press]]

CATEGORIES: Book publishing companies of Australia, Small press publishing companies, Publishing companies established in 1990

Quakers Hill Press is a small press Australian publishing company. It was founded in 1990 by Peter Day, a former US correspondent for The Australian.
Authors published include Geoffrey Partington, David Stove, James Franklin, Roger Sworder, Patrick Morgan and R. J. Stove.
Especially noteworthy are the events surrounding the June 1996 publication of the QHP book Hasluck Versus Coombs: White Politics and Australia's Aborigines, by Flinders University scholar Geoffrey Partington. The book was launched in the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra by John Herron, the then Federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. This generated front-page publicity (see The Australian's issue  of 17 June 1996) and much controversy. It signalled a renewed interest by the recently elected Howard Government in the then-unpopular assimilationist policies associated with Paul Hasluck, in contrast to the separatist policies of H.C. ('Nugget') Coombs. This was one of the first steps in the reversal of indigenous policy that eventually led to the 'Intervention' of 2007. While the policies advocated by Partington are now more or less commonplace in Australian  indigenous policy circles, in 1996 they produced outrage. This included a petition signed by 66 Australian academics, led by Dr Suvendrini Perera of La Trobe University, demanding that the Australian media cease publicising the book. Two printings quickly sold out. The book is still out of print, but may now be downloaded in digital form from the website of the Bennelong Society, including a new Preface by Gary Johns, Special Minister of State and Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations in the Keating Labor Government of 1993–1996.
Another notable QHP publication was Cricket versus Republicanism by Sydney philosopher David Stove. While Stove had for many years enjoyed a strong international reputation among philosophers, this provocative little book helped take his work to a wider audience, both internationally and in Australia. Recent well-received republications of Stove's work in the US include Against the Idols of the Age (ed Roger Kimball, Transaction Publishers); and Darwinian Fairytales: Selfish Genes, Errors of Heredity and Other Fables of Evolution, published by Encounter Books. Both these volumes include essays that appeared in QHP's Cricket versus Republicanism.

[[Maitland baronets]]

CATEGORIES: Baronetcies

There have been three baronetcies created for persons with the surname Maitland, two in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia and one in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Two of the creations are extant as of 2008 while the other is either dormant or extinct.
The Maitland Baronetcy, of Pitrichies in the County of Aberdeen, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 12 March 1672 for Richard Maitland. The title became either extinct or dormant on the death of the fourth Baronet in circa 1704.
The Maitland Baronetcy, of Ravelrig, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 18 November 1680 for the Hon. John Maitland, second son of Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale. In 1695 he succeeded his elder brother as fifth Earl of Lauderdale. See this title for further history of the baronetcy.
The Maitland, later Gibson-Maitland, later Ramsay-Gibson-Maitland, later Maitland Baronetcy, of Clifton in the County of Midlothian, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 30 November 1818 for General the Hon. Alexander Maitland. He was the fifth son of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale (see Earl of Lauderdale for earlier history of the family). The second Baronet assumed the additional surname of Gibson. The third Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Midlothian. He assumed the additional surname of Ramsay. The fifth Baronet and his successors have used the surname of Maitland only. As of 13 June 2007 the presumed tenth and present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the baronetage, with the baronetcy dormant since 1994. For more information, follow this link. As a descendant of the sixth Earl of Lauderdale the presumed tenth Baronet is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles.
Frederick Maitland, fourth son of the first Baronet, was a General in the British Army.

A number of contestants (known as "housemates") live in a purpose-built house in Espoo, and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, each housemate nominates two of their peers for eviction, and the housemates who receive the most nominations will face a public vote. Of these, one will eventually leave, having been "evicted" from the House. However, there sometimes are exceptions to this process as dictated by Big Brother, known as "twists".

Province flowers are species of plants selected to represent each province of Sweden. The origin of province flowers came from the American idea of state flowers, and was brought to Sweden by August Wickström and Paul Petter Waldenström in 1908. Waldenström published the proposal to introduce province flowers in the May 288, 1908 edition of the newspaper Stockholms Dagblad, and requested suggestions of species from the country's botanics. A list was put together on June 7, 1908, by professor Veit B. Wittrock from the Botanical Garden in Stockholm. Scania and Hälsingland violently opposed the plants that were selected to represent them; Scania was given European Beech but wanted oxeye daisy, while Hälsingland was given Scots Pine but wanted flax. Erik E:son Hammar, a pastor and politician in Sweden, granted the two provinces' wish to change their province flowers in 1909.[tpl]cite book|last=Hamrin|first=Örjan|title=Dalarnas hembygdsbok|editor=Raihle, Jan;  Ståhl, Elisabeth|publisher=Dalarnas fornminnes- och hembygdsförbund|location=Falun|date=2003|volume=73|chapter=Vilken är Dalarnas landskapsblomma?|isbn=91-87466-66-X|language=Swedish[/tpl] There is still debate amongst several other provinces over which species should represent them and they have therefore been given two province flowers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://arbetarbladet.se/merlasning/ulfivarshistoria/1.1028255|title=Den 100-åriga liljekonvaljen |last=Nilsson|first=Ulf|date=May 10, 2009|work=Arbetarbladet|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-20[/tpl]

Noisy text has been defined as any text obtained through an extraction process (i.e. transcription, OCR) from media other than original electronic texts.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2005.248 |title=Noisy text categorization|year=2005|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Volume|last=Vinciarelli|first=A.|volume=27|issue=12[/tpl] The noise can be seen as all the differences between the surface form of a coded representation of the text and the intended, correct, or original text. It can be due to e.g. typographic errors or colloquialisms always present in natural language and usually lowers the data quality in a way that makes the text less accessible to automated processing by computers such as natural language processing. 
Language usage over computer mediated discourses, like chats, emails and SMS texts, significantly differs from the standard form of the language. An urge towards shorter message length facilitating faster typing and the need for semantic clarity, shape the structure of this text used in such discourses.
Various business analysts estimate that unstructured data constitutes around 80% of the whole enterprise data.http://clarabridge.com/default.aspx?tabid=137&ModuleID=635&ArticleID=551 A great proportion of this data comprises chat transcripts, emails and other informal and semi-formal internal and external communications. Usually such text is meant for human consumption, but - given the amount of data - manual processing and evaluation of those resources is not practically feasible anymore. This raises the need for robust text mining methods as described in noisy text analytics.

A fifth term, lusitropy, was introduced in 1982 when relaxation was recognized to be an active process, and not simply dissipation of the contractile event.[tpl]cite journal|last=Katz AM|author2=Smith VE|journal=Eur Heart J|year=1982|volume=3 (Suppl D)|pages=11–18[/tpl] In an article in the American Journal of Medical Sciences, these five terms were described as the five fundamental properties of the heart.[tpl]cite book|title=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sxACAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA46|year=1908|publisher=J.B.

 Bathmotropic (derived from the Greek word "bathmos", meaning step or threshold) refers to modification of the degree of excitability (threshold of excitation), of musculature in general, and of heart musculature specifically. It is used especially to describe the effects of the cardiac nerves on cardiac excitability.Miriam Webster's Medical Dictionary and Online Medical Dictionary Positive bathmotropic effects increase the response of muscle to stimulation, whereas negative bathmotropic effects decrease the response of muscle to stimulation.The Kanji Foundry Press - b 
While bathmotropic, as used herein, has been defined as pertaining to modification of the excitability of the heart, it can also refer to modification of the irritability of heart muscle, and the two terms are frequently used interchangeably.http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bathmotropy

CATEGORIES: Orders, decorations, and medals of Ukraine, Honorary titles of Ukraine

People's Artist of Ukraine is an honorary and the highest title awarding to outstanding performing artists whose merits are exceptional in the sphere of the development of the performing arts (theatre, music, dance, circus, cinema, etc.). 
Established in 1922 during Soviet times, it was technically called People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR (Народний артист УРСР). With the establishment of independent Ukraine, this tradition was kept and the title was renamed as People's Artist of Ukraine (Народний артист України). 
Its recipients include many of the most highly-acclaimed composers, dancers, singers, musicians, film and theatre directors, actors, circus performers, etc.
During Soviet times, a person was usually named People's Artist only after reaching the age of 40. Exceptions were made for ballet artists. 
In 2005 the vocalist of the Ukrainian band Vopli Vidplyasova Oleh Skrypka refused to accept the title.
There also is[tpl]or|date=April 2012[/tpl] another honorary title, the Distinguished Artist of Ukraine («Заслужений артист України»), which is considered less important.  Typically, the People's Artist award is given at least 10 years after one has earned the Distinguished Artist of Ukraine award.http://usembassykyiv.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/standing-ovation-american-musical-conductor-hobart-earle-emerges-as-peoples-artist-of-ukraine/

[[Romantic racism]]

CATEGORIES: Definition of racism controversy

Romantic racism is a form of racism in which members of a dominant group supposedly project their fantasies onto members of oppressed groups.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press[tpl]pn|date=November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Hoberek|first=Andrew|year=2005|title=Liberal Antiliberalism: Mailer, O'Connor, and The Gender Politics of Middle-Class Ressentiment|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=33|issue=3/4|pages=24–47|jstor=40004417[/tpl]Wallace, Michele (19791990) Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman. London: Verso[tpl]pn|date=November 2013[/tpl] Jack Kerouac, and other Beatnik authors of the 1950s of romantic racism. They point out that the dominant culture of the 1950s in the United States stressed conformity and held up middle-class suburban families as the cultural ideal was indifferent to art and literature, upheld racial segregation and anti-Semitism, and despised or ignored black achievements, such as jazz. Those, like the novelist Norman Mailer, who felt limited by or alienated from mainstream culture, sought out influences from other cultures as form of rebellion. Mailer, a great fan of jazz music, created his concept of what it meant to be "hip," or a member of the white urban counterculture, largely on his perception of the culture of urban African-Americans (with whom the expression "hip", meaning "in the know", originated) and articulated his vision in his essay "The White Negro." Mailer, who considered himself an opponent of Victorian sexual repression and regimentation idealized what he saw as the sexual and other freedoms of minority and other counter-cultural groups, overlooking the fact that in these groups sexual exploitation of women sometimes occurred. These critics consider his depictions of what he imagines African-American life to be like as an instance of what they call "romantic racism", contending that he implies that in urban ghettoes—filled with sex, drugs, and violence—life is somehow enriched, rather than hurt, by poverty and crime. Mailer's essay has also been criticized for spreading the stereotype of African-American men as hypermasculine and hypersexual.
These critics also identify numerous other examples of romantic racism in depictions of Native Americans in popular culture, along with other unfounded stereotypes and oversimplifications that create caricatures of various racial and ethnic groups.
Romantic racist stereotypes about East Asians include notions of esoteric "oriental wisdom", supposedly incomprehensible to unsophisticated westerners.

The Soviet offensive commenced with the Soviet 2nd Shock Army breaching the defence of the II Army Corps along the Emajõgi River in the vicinity of Tartu.

Yusuf Ali Chowdhury (1905–1971), commonly referred to as Mohan Mia, was a prominent Bengali Muslim politician in South Asia. He played an active role in the Pakistan Movement as a leading figure of the Muslim League in Bengal. He was a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly in the 1930s and 1940s and also became a minister in the provincial government of  East Bengal led by Sher-e-Bangla A.K. Fazlul Huq in 1950s. Later on he went onto to become a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNA). As candidates suggested by him had won almost all the seats in the sweeping election of 1954 which propelled Bengali nationalists into the central government, Pakistan's press proclaimed Mohan Mia "The King Maker of East Pakistan".
He became a champion of Bengali rights during the early days of Pakistan. In 1954, under the orders of Governor Iskander Mirza, the Pakistani government arrested the two most outspoken leaders of East Bengal at the time - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Yusuf Ali Chowdhury.http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P015 The arrests led to an outcry across the province and triggered mass protests. In the following days thousands were arrested including university professors, provincial assembly members, and students. The government's tough stand aggravated the already bitter resentment of Bengalis following the Language Movement of 1952.
Mohan Mia however he became highly controversial during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 because of his staunch opposition to the notion of the breakup of Pakistan. Although he spent most of his political career battling against the West Pakistani elite, Mohan Mia, in sharp contrast to most of his family, stopped short of calling for an independent state for Bengalis. He joined the infamous Central Peace Committee along with other pro-Pakistani Bengali politicians. He died in Karachi in November, 1971, just a few days before the end of the war.

[[Indigenous people of the Everglades region]]
CATEGORIES: Everglades, History of Key West, Florida, Native American history of Florida, Native American tribes in Florida, Seminole tribe

The indigenous people of the Everglades region arrived in the Florida peninsula of what is now the United States approximately 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, probably following large game. The Paleo-Indians found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted to prairie and xeric scrub conditions. Large animals became extinct in Florida around 11,000 years ago. Climate changes 6,500 years ago brought a wetter landscape. The Paleo-Indians slowly adapted to the new conditions. Archaeologists call the cultures that resulted from the adaptations Archaic peoples. They were better suited for environmental changes than their ancestors, and created many tools with the resources they had. Approximately 5,000 years ago, the climate shifted again to cause the regular flooding from Lake Okeechobee that gave rise to the Everglades ecosystems.
From the Archaic peoples, two major tribes emerged in the area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The earliest written descriptions of these people come from Spanish explorers who sought to convert and conquer them. Although they lived in complex societies, little evidence of their existence remains today. The Calusa were more powerful in number and political structure. Their territory was  centered on modern-day Ft. Myers, and extended as far north as Tampa, as far east as Lake Okeechobee, and as far south as the Keys. The Tequesta lived on the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula around what is today Biscayne Bay and the Miami River. Both societies were well adapted to live in the various ecosystems of the Everglades regions. They often traveled through the heart of the Everglades, though they rarely lived within it.
After more than 210 years of relations with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted in some of the first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles continue to live in the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.

CATEGORIES: Political books, Reference works, 20th-century books, Translations

Marx/Engels Collected Works (MECW) is the largest collection of translations into English of the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It contains all works published by Marx and Engels in their lifetimes and numerous unpublished manuscripts and letters. The Collected Works, which was translated by Richard Dixon and others, consists of 50 volumes. It was compiled and printed between 1975 and 2005 by Progress Publishers (Moscow) in collaboration with Lawrence and Wishart (London) and International Publishers (New York).
The Collected Works contains material written by Marx between 1835 and his death in 1883, and by Engels between 1838 and his death in 1895. The early volumes include juvenilia, including correspondence between Marx and his father, Marx's poetry, and letters from Engels to his sister. Several volumes collect the pair's articles for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
Other volumes in the Collected Works contain well-known works of Marx and Engels, including The Communist Manifesto, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, and Capital, lesser-known works, and previously unpublished or untranslated manuscripts. The Collected Works includes 13 volumes of correspondence by the mature Marx and Engels, covering the period from 1844 through 1895.
Although the Collected Works is the most complete collection of the work by Marx and Engels published to date in English, it is not their complete works. A project to publish the pair's complete works in German is expected to require more than 120 volumes.

The team's head football coach was future Hall-of-Famer Charlie Bachman.  The Wildcats played their home games in brand new Memorial Stadium, which opened that year.  Before the season started, Coach Bachman arranged for a live wildcat to be kept on the sidelines of the new stadium as team mascot.  The wildcat was named "Touchdown," and the live mascot started a tradition that lasted over fifty years, until it was ended in the 1970s with the death of "Touchdown VIII."
At the conclusion of the season, guard Ray Hahn was named a first team All-American by Grantland Rice, becoming the first football player in school history to be so honored.

The Cistercians are a Roman Catholic religious order of enclosed monks, whose monasteries and abbeys have been built from 1098. The first Cistercian abbey was Cîteaux Abbey. Their monasteries spread throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, but many were closed during the Protestant Reformation, the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII, the French Revolution, and the revolutions of the 18th century. Some survived and new monasteries have been founded since the 19th century.
There are a certain number of medieval monasteries and other cistercians buildings (salt factories, Watermills) that are abandoned or ruined, or converted into hotels such as Monasterio de Piedra or St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church.[tpl]cite journal |last=de Ange |first=Angie |year=2007 |month= |title=Oldest Building in the West |journal=Orange & Blue |volume= |issue= |pages= | publisher = College of Journalism & Communications| location =University of Florida |id= |url=http://www.jou.ufl.edu/pubs/onb/s07/index.php?id=51 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |quote=The St. Bernard de Clairvaux Episcopal Church, known as North Miami Beach’s Ancient Spanish Monastery, it is one of the oldest buildings in the Western Hemisphere.[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Weird Florida |last=Carlson |first=Charle |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 2005 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location= |isbn=978-0-7607-5945-5 |page=136 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LEVpJytFVYcC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=St.+Bernard+de+Clairvaux+Church+oldest [/tpl]

Louis Moreau (1883-1958) was a French wood-engraver, anarchist and militant pacifist.
Trained as a lithographer, in 1900 he settled in Paris to practice his trade. There he developed a passion for drawing, painting and engraving. Additionally, he began contributing to Jean Grave's Temps Nouveaux. Mobilized during World War I, he nevertheless contributed to Pierre Chardon's clandestine newspaper Semeur in 1916.
Between the two disastrous World Wars his "Femme libérée" illustrated l'Idée Libre and he contributed wood engravings to Émile Armand's Néo-Naturien and L'EnDehors.
With Germain Delatouche, a fellow engraver and libertarian, Moreau formed the group Les Partisans in 1924.
Portraits of famous anarchists, antimilitarist illustrations, naturist landscapes and various wood engravings by Moreau decorate many libertarian books and journals including Les Humbles, La Revue Anarchiste, l'Almanach de la paix (1934), L'Unique (until 1956) and numerous titles from Joseph Ishill's Oriole Press.
Although an artist of immense talent, Moreau rejected stardom and mocked official recognition. Manuel Devaldès, a friend and fellow artist, wrote his biography in 1935.

Fort James Jackson (usually shortened to Fort Jackson or Old Fort Jackson  but unrelated to Andrew Jackson) is a restored 19th century fort located two miles east of Savannah on the Savannah River.  It is a National Historic Landmark and the oldest standing brick fort in the U.S. state of Georgia.Old Fort Jackson brochure
U.S. President Thomas Jefferson authorized the construction of a national defense system of fortifications to defend his new nation. Jefferson's system included Fort Jackson, constructed between 1808 and 1812 over an old earthen battery from the American Revolution. At the time, war with Great Britain or France seemed likely, and Fort Jackson was the best site from which to protect Savannah from attack by sea. In the War of 1812, local militias and U.S. troops saw active duty at Fort Jackson. After the War of 1812, two periods of construction followed at the fort. A moat, drawbridge, brick barracks, privies, a rear wall, and another powder magazine were added.
James Jackson, the namesake of the fort, was a British native who fought for the American cause and rose to the rank of colonel. When he was twenty-five, Jackson accepted the surrender of the British in Savannah at the close of the revolution. He was later a U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, and Governor of Georgia.

During the American Civil War, Fort Jackson, along with nearby Fort McAllister and Fort Pulaski, defended Savannah from Union attack. In 1862, Fort Jackson was shelled from a ship captained by an escaped slave named Robert Smalls.
When the Union Army commanded by William T. Sherman captured Savannah by land on December 20, 1864, Confederate troops abandoned the fort and retreated across the Savannah River into South Carolina. Confederate troops from Savannah joined other forces in North Carolina and South Carolina and continued to fight until April 26, 1865, when they surrendered to General Sherman's army at Durham, North Carolina. Several different regiments garrisoned Fort Jackson during the Union occupation of Savannah. One of these units was the 55th Massachusetts Regiment, which consisted of African American troops.
From 1884 to 1905, Fort Jackson was known as Fort Oglethorpe and was little used by the U.S. military. It was purchased by the city of Savannah in 1924 for park purposes but not fully restored until the 1970s.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: Fort James Jackson / Fort Oglethorpe|32 KB[/tpl]|date=August 21, 1998 |author=Jefferson C.

Fort Jackson is located at 1 Fort Jackson Road, on the Islands Expressway linking Savannah to Fort Pulaski and the town of Tybee Island.  Fort Jackson is owned by the state of Georgia and operated as a museum by Coastal Heritage Society, which also manages Savannah History Museum, Georgia State Railroad Museum (formerly the Railroad Roundhouse Museum), Savannah Children's Museum and, most recently, Pin Point Heritage Museum. In the summer the fort has a daily cannon-firing demonstration. Admission is $7 for adults.

Get Well Soon is a music and band project of the German singer, songwriter and instrumentalist Konstantin Gropper (born September 28, 1982 in Biberach an der Riß, Upper Swabia, Baden-Württemberg).
Gropper worked 3 years on his debut album Rest Now, Weary Head! You Will Get Well Soon which was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Benelux, Spain, Italy by the Label City Slang and by Nude Records in the UK and Ireland in January 2008 following lots of positive reviews in the biggest German, French and UK music magazines. The lyrics are known to be slightly philosophical and cynical (e.g. Witches! Witches! Rest Now In The Fire and We Are Safe Inside While They Burn Down Our House). The album entered the German Album Charts on no. 28. It also entered the Austrian and Swiss charts and was successful in Benelux as well. The release tour with 19 most sold out shows was the most successful newcomer tour in Germany in 2008. The Album release was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazine, Uncut, Artrocker, Guardian). The album was released in France in September 2008 and entered the official French album charts on no. 91.
In 2008 Konstantin Gropper also wrote exclusive tracks for the latest Wim Wenders movie Palermo Shooting, alongside other artists like Portishead and Nick Cave.
The second album Vexations was released in Europe in January 2010. Unlike the debut, it was preproduced by Konstantin Gropper and then was recorded with a full band in a studio. It entered the German album charts at number 11 (charts entries in most European countries) and the European charts on 52. It was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazin, Mojo, Musikexpress, Visions, Spex, Uncle Sallys, FAZ, SZ, Le Monde, Liberation etc..). The release was followed by a soldout 36 shows tour throughout Europe.
In 2011 Konstantin Gropper wrote the scoremusic to the first season of the French series Xanadu, which was broadcast in France and Germany by ARTE TV.

A century later the Deanery was merged with the Vicarage of Llandaff. The Chapter forfeited its legal rights on Disestablishment in 1920. The previous Dean was Janet Henderson.

CATEGORIES: Inter-process communication, Streaming, Packets (information technology), Computer networking

In packet switching networks, traffic flow, packet flow or network flow is a sequence of packets from a source computer to a destination, which may be another host, a multicast group, or a broadcast domain. RFC 2722 defines traffic flow as "an  artificial logical equivalent to a call or connection." RFC 3697 defines traffic flow as "a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast destination that the source desires to label as a flow.  A flow could consist of all packets in a specific transport connection or a media stream.  However, a flow is not necessarily 1:1 mapped to a transport connection." Flow is also defined in RFC 3917 "a set of IP packets passing an observation point in the network during a certain time interval."

The line connects with the Kisei Main Line at Taki Station. From Taki, the line runs parallel to the Kintetsu Yamada Line and Kintetsu Toba Line. These lines all serve the Ise-Shima tourist region.
The name of the line, "Sangū", was chosen because that word is a kanji abbreviation of a phrase in Japanese that roughly translates to "a pilgrimage to Ise Grand Shrine", and making the pilgrimage to the Shrine easier is exactly why the line was built.

Michel Bastarache dit Basque (7 February 1730 – 15 January 1820) is notable in Canadian history for his role in the expulsion of the Acadians from New Brunswick. More specifically he was part of the expulsion from the Fort Beauséjour area (near Sackville, N.B.). He, and some of his family, became renowned for their bravery during this period. 
Michel and his brother Pierre were part of a contingent of 960 Acadians sent to South Carolina in 1755. The next year about a dozen of this group, including Pierre, escaped and headed north on foot. They reached Lake Ontario, were captured by Iroquois, and ransomed by a fur trader who took them to Quebec, where they arrived in September 1756. There they were questioned by Governor Vaudreuil.
The brothers went to Panaccadie, New Brunswick, where a few Acadian families were in hiding. Bastarache learned that his wife had fled to Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island). He brought his wife and children back to New Brunswick where they went into hiding again, where Pierre Du Calvet made note of them living in 1761. They and four children were prisoners at Fort Cumberland in 1763. A large number of  families requested deportation to France, but were refused permission to leave as they were considered British subjects.
The family eventually were allowed to stay and the long line of the Basque family continues to this day.

[[Pulpitum]]

CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Church architecture, Catholic liturgy, Christian religious objects, Gothic architecture, Romanesque architecture, Walls

The pulpitum is a common feature in medieval cathedral and monastic architecture in Europe. It is a massive screen, most often constructed of stone, or occasionally timber, that divides the choir (the area containing the  choir stalls and high altar in a cathedral, collegiate or monastic church) from the nave and ambulatory (the parts of the church to which lay worshippers may have access).[tpl]cite book |last=Morris |first=Richard |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Cathedrals and Abbeys of England and Wales |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1979 |month= |publisher=Dent |location=London |language= |isbn=0-460-04334-X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=144 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]  Typically the pulpitum is lavishly carved and decorated, and those of York Minster and Canterbury Cathedral preserve complete medieval sets of statues of the Kings of England. 
The word pulpitum is applied in ecclesiastical Latin both for this form of screen and also for a pulpit; the secular origin of the term being a theatrical stage, or speaker's dais.[tpl]cite book |last=Friar |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=A Companion to the English Parish Church|origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1996 |month= |publisher=Bramley Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-85833-738-0 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=369 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] It is thought that this form of screen originated in monastic practice, providing a raised stage from which members of a religious communities could address pilgrims attending to venerate the church's relics, while still maintaining their monastic seclusion from lay contact. 
An internal stair within the thickness of the pulpitum gives access to a broad upper platform, which commonly supports the cathedral organ. The pulpitum is invariably pierced by a central passage, leading immediately into the choir stalls to the (ritual) east. Many pulpitums, as those of Glasgow Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral and Southwell Minster, incorporated subsidiary altars either side of their central passages. In the late medieval period, there would have always have been a rood screen or rood beam placed one bay to the west of the pulpitum (i.e. further away from the high altar of the cathedral); which would have had the main nave altar for the use of lay worshippers set against its western face; and which was pierced by lateral doors, left and right, for processional access to the nave; and through which pilgrims could pass into the eastern arm of the church so as to proceed via the ambulatory to the feretory or shrine, commonly located behind the high altar. Most cathedral rood screens were demolished at the English Reformation, although the cathedrals of Peterborough and Canterbury retained their separate rood screens into the 18th century; and in the collegiate church of Ottery Saint Mary, both sets of screens remained until the early 19th century. At the former monastic churches of Saint Albans and Ewenny the rood screen survives, while the pulpitum does not. 
Several English cathedrals demolished their pulpitums in the early 19th century, intending to open the view from the congregation to the high altar; but in most instances this was found to be unsatisfactory, and a much less massive chancel screen was erected in its place.

[[Methods of praying the rosary]]
CATEGORIES: Rosary

Five methods of praying the rosary are presented within the works of Saint Louis de Montfort, a French Roman Catholic priest and writer of the early 18th century. Montfort was an early proponent of Mariology, and much of his work is devoted to the subjects of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the rosary. While the rosary contains a fixed set of prayers recited with the use of beads, Montfort proposed a number of methods to pray the rosary with more thorough devotion. Two of the methods are described in his book The Secret of the Rosary, in the fiftieth rose (chapter):
 
 "In order to facilitate the exercise of the holy Rosary, here are several methods to recite it holily, with the meditation of the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries of Jesus and Mary. You stop at that which is most to your liking: you can form yourself another particular method, as several saintly persons have done." 

Three additional methods (i.e., five in total) are listed in the book God Alone, based on the collected writings of St. Louis.

[[Motte v Faulkner]]
CATEGORIES: Printers, 1735 in law, United Kingdom copyright case law, Court of Chancery cases, 1735 in England, English case law

Motte v Faulkner (decided 28 November 1735) was a copyright lawsuit between Benjamin Motte and George Faulkner over who had the legal rights to publish the works of Jonathan Swift in London. This trial was one of the first to test the Statute of Anne copyright law in regards to Irish publishing independence. Although neither held the copyright to all of Swift's works, the suit became a legal struggle over Irish rights, which were eventually denied by the English courts. Faulkner, in 1735, published the Works of Jonathan Swift in Dublin. However, a few of the works were under Motte's copyright within the Kingdom of Great Britain, and when Faulkner sought to sell his book in London, Motte issued a formal complaint to Jonathan Swift and then proceeded to sue Faulkner. An injunction was issued in Motte's favor, and the book was prohibited from being sold on British soil. The basis of the law protected the rights of the author, and not the publisher, of the works, and Swift was unwilling to support a lawsuit against Faulkner. With Swift's reaction used as a basis, the lawsuit was later seen as a struggle between the rights of Irishmen to print material that were denied under English law.Ehrenpreis 1983 p. 787

[[Hedley Churchward]]

CATEGORIES: English painters, 1929 deaths, Converts to Islam, People from Aldershot, Year of birth missing

Al-Hajj Hedley Churchward (Mahmoud Mobarek) (Aldershot – 28 August 1929 Johannesburg), was an English set designer and painter, notable for converting to Islam and in 1910 being the first known British Muslim to make the Hajj.
Hedley's father, a member of a respected and ancient English family, was a commissar in the British Army at the time of the Crimean War. During Hedley's childhood he came into contact with his father’s rather unusual circle of friends and acquaintances, spending some time at the Court of Queen Victoria. He was sent to Kilburn College, where he “shared lollipops with the sons of South American presidents, of Indian generals, of big-game hunters, polar explorers and professional empire builders” (Eric Rosenthal, From Drury Lane to Mecca).Famous London Muslims. Masud.co.uk (10 December 1953). Retrieved on 27 August 2011.
His painting skills were noticed at Kilburn and he was promptly commandeered to produce backdrops. He was later apprenticed to the well-known scene-painter Walter Brookes Spong of Sadler's Wells Theatre, and in the 1880s became an important part of London’s West End circle of artists, working at the Globe Theatre and Drury Lane, and with notable figures such as Tennyson, Millais, Lord Leighton, and Lily Langtry.
On a trip to Spain, Hedley Churchward first made his acquaintance with Islam. He was awed by the Alhambra in Granada and the stunning architecture of the Córdoba Mosque, developed a liking for the landscape of Al-Andalus, and determined to travel to Morocco. He became steeped in Arab culture, gradually exchanging his western clothing for local garb and announcing to his family that he had adopted Islam.
In Cairo, his growing reputation in the Arab world, resulted in a commission to decorate one of the city's mosques. He built a home for himself close to the Pyramids, and became a student at the Al-Azhar. He proved an able scholar, and soon preached sermons at a small mosque, winning an appointment as lecturer in Sira at the Qadi's Academy.Conversion: Islam, the growing religion. Salaam.co.uk. Retrieved on 27 August 2011. In the years that followed he shuttled between England and Morocco, also managing to visit Australia and South Africa to investigate work opportunities. In South Africa his art and easy elegance gained him the patronage of Cecil Rhodes and the favour of the Randlords. Churchward's intercession with President Paul Kruger resulted in the construction of the first mosque on the Witwatersrand.
His many visits to Cairo led to his marrying the daughter of a Shafi Jurist of Al-Azhar. After his conversion he planned on making the Hajj to Mecca, amidst doubts expressed by the British Embassy in Cairo. He was subjected to a lengthy examination by the Qadi of Egypt to determine the extent of his faith and knowledge. Passing the test, he received a testimonial ornately endorsed by the chief Ottoman cleric, leading scholars and imams, certifying his suitability for the pilgrimage.
Hedley and his wife settled amongst the Cape Malays of South Africa. A year later Hedley left Johannesburg on the first stage of his hajj. The steamship voyage went via Bombay, where he arranged passage on an ancient pilgrim ship, the SS Islamic. The vessel, armed against pirates, and captained by a cantankerous Scotsman, finally made its way to the Red Sea. The boat docked at the Sudanese port of Suakin, where Churchward called on the British Consul, to be informed that the Arab authorities would almost certainly not allow him to disembark at Jeddah. Having arrived in Jeddah, Hedley encountered no problem with the officials and set off the following evening with two donkeys and a pilgrim guide with Halley's Comet a brilliant spectacle in the heavens.
After two days of hot and exhausting travel, Hedley and his guide arrived in the Holy City.
A large number of Churchward's paintings and drawings are preserved at the University of Witwatersrand.

The Canonesses Regular of the Holy Sepulchre are a Catholic female religious order founded in the 14th century. They were originally the female branch of the ancient military Order of that name, the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre. The Canonesses follow the Rule of St. Augustine.
The traditional habit was black, and, when in church, over the tunic the choir Sisters would wear a white, sleeveless, linen rochet, on the left side of which was embroidered a red, double-barred Cross. Where still used, a black veil is worn by the professed, and a white one by novices and lay sisters; the later category, however, was abolished among religious orders by order of the Holy See in the 20th century.

CATEGORIES: 2008 albums, Misery Signals albums, Albums with cover art by Sons of Nero

Controller is the third studio album released by Misery Signals and was released July 22, 2008. The album was recorded by producer Devin Townsend who produced Misery Signals' debut record Of Malice, and the Magnum Heart.
On April 28th 2008, Misery Signals posted their first single for Controller called "Weight of the World". Bassist, Kyle Johnson said "It was the first song we recorded for the new album and it's a different song for us, it's little angrier, faster and actually the shortest song clocking in at a little over two minutes."
Vocalist Karl Schubach goes onto say "It was the first song we tracked and Devin Townsend (Producer) had me run through the entire song once just to get down the idea of where I wanted to go. He told me that I nailed it right off the bat and we ended up keeping most of it as the finished version. The song itself is about deciding whether you should tell someone what you really think and get it off of your chest or take the high road and let them think that they are right. That situation can really blow up.":: Altsounds.com
Recently they have filmed a video for their track "A Certain Death" which will serve as the first single off Controller. The video was directed by renowned music video director David Brodsky and starred B-movie actor Brandon Slagle in the narrative portions of the video.
Some 2,900 copies were sold in the first week of release. According to several sources, the album could have exceeded the limit of 20,000 copies sold.

Filippo Negroli (ca. 1510–1579) was an armourer from Milan. He was renowned as being extremely skilled, and may be considered the most famous armourer of all time. Working together with his younger brothers Giovan Battista (ca. 1511-1591) and Francesco (ca. 1522-1600) in the Negroli family workshop headed by their father Gian Giacomo Negroli (ca. 1463-1543), Filippo was specialized in repoussé of armour, whereas his brother Francesco was renowned for his damascening skills. Filippo's pieces are considered especially remarkable because they were wrought in steel, rather than the more-easily worked iron that was the traditionally assumed medium.
He made parade armour for several esteemed clients, including Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Guidobaldo II della Rovere.
Examples of his work include:

[[Crown of Christian V]]

CATEGORIES: Crown jewels, Crowns, Danish monarchy, Regalia, State ritual and ceremonies, Visitor attractions in Copenhagen

thumb|right|200px|Crown of Christian VThe crown of King Christian V of Denmark was the crown used at the coronation of all of Denmark's absolutist kings, see Absolute monarchy. While the reign of such monarchs ended in 1840, the crown is still used during a Danish king's castrum doloris, the last time in 1972.
Used by the kings from Christian V to Christian VIII. Made by Paul Kurtz in Copenhagen, 1670-1671. Gold with enamel and table-cut stones. Total weight 2080 g. Also 2 garnets and 2 sapphires, of which the largest dates back to Frederick I of Denmark.
Frederik III had large parts of his daughters' trousseau bought in Paris, which, already at that time, was a centre for European fashion. But the jewellery was commissioned to Kurtz. He was, therefore, considered an outstanding jeweller. In 1670-1671 he made his principal piece of work, Crown of Christian V. The closed shape was inspired by the crown of Louis XIV of France, but Kurtz replaced the lily-shaped points of the French crown with palmettes and adorned the crown with a row of diamonds intertwined with palmette and acanthus. In that way a "white" play of light was created, which was framed by blue and red in the sapphires and garnets of the crown ring and the orb and cross in the top.
The crown forms part of the National Coat of arms of Denmark and the Royal Coat of arms. Since 1671, the crown has been the de facto symbol of the state power. It is included in stylized and varied forms in most state institutions, including ministries.

It was a triumph for Émile Levassor who arrived first after completing the 1,178 km in 48 hours, nearly six hours ahead of the runner-up. However, the official winner was Paul Koechlin, who arrived third in his Peugeot, exactly 11 hours slower than Levassor, but officially the race had been for four-seater cars, whereas Levassor and the runner-up drove two-seater cars.[ref]

CATEGORIES: 1871 births, American football quarterbacks, Notre Dame Fighting Irish football players, 1903 deaths

Charles W. Zeitler (August 1871—1903) was an American football player from South Bend, Indiana.  Zeitler holds the distinction of being the first quarterback for the University of Notre Dame to win four games—a mark that would not be surpassed until Angus McDonald led the team to six victories in 1899.
Zeitler was born to a family of Bavarian immigrants in Clay Township, just north of South Bend, Indiana.  His father, John V. Zeitler, was a very wealthy landowner and farmer who had held local office as a trustee and assessor.
Joining the Notre Dame football team in 1893 at a time when the program had just begun to schedule major opponents in earnest, Zeitler made the most of the opportunity, beginning the season 4-0 with victories over Kalamazoo, Albion, DeLasalle and Hillsdale, before finally falling 0-8 to Chicago in a road game on New Year's Day.  The following season, Zeitler moved to the right end position, yielding the quarterback job to Nicholas Dinkel.
Zeitler returned to his homestead after graduation, where, sadly, in 1903 he succumbed to an attack of Typhoid fever.  He is buried in the South Bend City Cemetery.

Aberdour Castle is located in the village of Easter Aberdour, Fife, Scotland. Parts of the castle date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable standing castles in Scotland, along with Castle Sween in Argyll, which was built at around the same time.Tabraham, Scotland's Castles, p.33
The earliest part of the castle comprised a modest hall house, on a site overlooking the Dour Burn. Over the next 400 years, the castle was successively expanded according to contemporary architectural ideas. The hall house became a tower house in the 15th century, and was extended twice in the 16th century. The final addition was made around 1635, with refined Renaissance details, and the whole was complemented by a walled garden to the east and terraced gardens to the south. The terraces, dating from the mid-16th century, form one of the oldest gardens in Scotland,[tpl]cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2400:15:0::::GARDEN:GDL00003 |title=Aberdour Castle |publisher=Historic Scotland |work=Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes |accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl] and offer extensive views across the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh.
The castle is largely the creation of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of Historic Scotland, and is open to the public all year.

CATEGORIES: Castles in Midi-Pyrénées, Official historical monuments of France, Gers

The Château de Herrebouc is a castle in the commune of Saint-Jean-Poutge in the Gers département of France.
Though an older building, the present look of the castle is the result of a major campaign of construction work at the start of the 17th century. On the ground floor, the 17th century ceiling is partially conserved. The farm buildings date from this period. The pigeon loft is characteristic of the architecture of the time of Henri IV (reigned 1589 to 1610). The wine cellar is probably a later structure. 
The mill still has an intact medieval base. Medieval walls are also visible in the buildings of the farm.
It has been listed since 1926 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

The Fifth Court (Icelandic: Fimmtardómur) was a high court established in Iceland approximately in the year 1015 during the period of the Icelandic Commonwealth.
The jurisdiction of the court was the entire country, as opposed the previous fjórðungsdómar (Quarter Courts), whose jurisdiction extended only their relevant quarter of the country.  The goal in establishing the court was probably unifying the judging of court cases throughout the whole country.  The fimmtardómur accepted appeals in cases already judged in one of the fjórðungsdómar.  The fimmtardómur consisted of 48 men.  36 of them judged in cases, while both plaintiff and defender could bump up to 6 judges.  Verdicts were decided by majority votes.  This arrangement lasted throughout the period of the Icelandic Commonwealth.

CATEGORIES: 1937 births, Irish folk singers, Irish-language singers, Musicians from County Galway, Living people

Tomás Mac Eoin (born 1937) is an Irish sean-nós singer, an affectionate actor, singer, songwriter and poet. He is best known as Tomás 'Jimmy' Mac Eoin from An Bóthar Buí in An Cheathrú Rua, Conamara, Galway, Ireland.
Irish is the spoken language, although Tomás, like most others in the area, is proficient in English also. As with many people in the West, his life seems to revolve around music. Although probably too modest to ever admit it, he seems to have an unending capacity for song-making. It has been said of him — “the man has forgotten more songs than most people would be able to learn in a lifetime of serious collecting”. Renowned for his old-style or sean-nós singing, he was voted the best sean-nós singer in Ireland in 1967 at the Oireachtas competitions and won the Ó’Riada Trophy.The Wayfarer December 1988
Some of Tomás's best known material include
Regular singer on RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, he also performed on The Late Late Show with Gay Byrne several times.

The Keflavík Agreement was an agreement made in 1946 between the government of the United States and the newly established Republic of Iceland, following the conclusion of World War II.  This agreement stipulated that the American army would leave the country within six months and that the Icelanders would take possession of Keflavík Airport.  With this agreement, all former agreements would be annulled.
The conditions of the agreement did not last long, however.  In 1951, a new agreement was made through NATO.  According to this defense treaty, the United States accepted responsibility for the defence of Iceland for an unspecified period of time.  This new agreement annulled the Keflavík Agreement.

[[Hans Gerle]]
CATEGORIES: German composers, Renaissance composers, 1500 births, 1570 deaths, German lutenists

Hans Gerle (ca. 1500, Nuremberg - 1570, Nuremberg) was a German lutenist and arranger of the Renaissance.
Little concrete information is available regarding Gerle's life. His father was probably Conrad Gerle (died 1521), one of the city's better-known lute makers. Gerle likely spent his entire life in Nuremberg.
Gerle published three volumes of lute music through Hieronymus Formschneider, a Nuremberg publisher. The first two were issued in 1532-33, and the last in 1552; this third volume refers to Gerle as "the elder" on the title page, so it is presumed that Gerle had either a son or another relative with the same name. The first publication contains an introduction to the performance of lute, viola da gamba (Grossgeigen), and rebec (Kleingeigen), as well as an explanation of musical notation, and is a significant source of information on performance practice. The book is primarily made up of intabulations of German composers such as Ludwig Senfl, Johann Walter, Heinrich Isaac, Thomas Stoltzer, and Paul Hofhaimer.
His second volume, for solo lute, features works from many older composers, such as Hayne van Ghizeghem, Josquin des Prez, Isaac, and Jacob Obrecht, as well as popular contemporaries such as Claudin de Sermisy, Adrian Willaert, Jean Mouton, and Senfl. The third volume was a transcription into German tablature of pieces previously only available in Italian tablature, including works of Giovanni Maria da Crema, Domenico Bianchini, Simon Gintzler, Francesco Canova da Milano, Pietro Paolo Borrono, and Alberto da Ripa.

The Ecuador composting method is a common composting practice in the lowlands of Ecuador and Peru. The compost pile is embedded on the tree trunk or banana stalks, with a pale erected in the middle. Organic matter is placed in layers on the trunks or stalks, each layer being covered by mud, or inlaid via different types of organic matter. When the pile is about 1.2 m high, it is watered and covered by big leaves. After some time, when the compost pile settles down, the central pale is removed for aeration. This composting method is typically done in a small-scale, by indigenous villagers.

The laws were followed by the granting of Iceland's first constitution in 1874.
Some time had passed since the abolition of absolute monarchy of the Danish king in 1848, and the Danish parliament had acquired legislative powers, while the Icelandic Althing was only a consultative assembly. The status of the Constitution of Denmark in Iceland was disputed: while the Danish government and legal experts claimed that the constitution did include Iceland, even though it had only to a limited degree become effective there, Icelandic politicians and Jón Sigurðsson in particular stated that the constitution was not valid in Iceland as it had never been formally made public there and as the royal promise that Iceland would be consulted on the constitution had not been fulfilled.Steining, pp. 322–25. The Danish trade monopoly had been abolished  in 1855, and the Icelanders' struggle for independence, led by Jón Sigurðsson and his supporters, found little backing in Copenhagen.
The proposed Icelandic constitution was accepted by the Althing with some changes, but their amendments were turned down by the Danish parliament in 1867.  The Danes passed the Stöðulög, which declared Iceland to be an inseparable part of Denmark.Björn Thorsteinsson, p. 226.  As compensation for this, the Danish state was to pay the Icelanders 50 thousand rigsdaler for the next ten years, decreasing to 30 thousand the following 20 years.  The Icelanders were not happy with these laws, and the Althing voted against them 10 votes to 14 but accepted the financial subsidy.Steining, p. 335.  According to the bill, the new office of "Land-Chief of Iceland" was introduced.  This official was to run the country according to orders from Denmark.  The first to occupy this office was Hilmar Finsen, who began his duties on 1 April 1873.

Generally, they can be operated from [tpl]convert|50|to|300|°C|°F|0[/tpl] . There is a thermostat controlling the temperature. These are digitally controlled to maintain the temperature. Their double walled insulation keeps the heat in and conserves energy, the inner layer being a poor conductor and outer layer being metallic. There is also an air filled space in between to aid insulation. An air circulating fan helps in uniform distribution of the heat. These are fitted with the adjustable wire mesh plated trays or aluminium trays and  may have an on/off rocker switch, as well as indicators and controls for temperature and holding time. The capacities of these ovens vary. Power supply needs vary from country to country, depending on the voltage and frequency (hertz) used.  Temperature sensitive tapes or other devices like those using bacterial spores can be used to work as controls, to test for the efficacy of the device in every cycle.

The Harbor Defense Museum, sometimes called The Caponier, located within the grounds of Fort Hamilton in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn is  a 19th-century fort, New York City's only military museum and one of only seventy military museums in the United States that is funded and operated by the Defense Department.
The Caponier, the given name of the building that now houses the museum, was a flank battery whose mission was to protect the main fortress from rear attacks, was originally a small fort within the larger fort, and now serves as the guardian of Fort Hamilton's history.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91038F935A15756C0A96F948260|title=Out of New York's Military Past|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1989-05-26|author=Andrew L.

Fort Hamilton is the "'second-oldest continuously garrisoned federal post in the nation,'" second only to West Point and its ties to the community are part of the charm of the museum and the fort. Although The Caponier was always prepared for battle, with a 24 pound cannon aimed at New York Harbor, the fort never experienced a battle. The museum houses an array of artifacts from New York's military history including American Revolutionary War relics, uniforms from various wars, old maps of the fort, the post's old switchboard, an exhibit on a secret tunnel that connected Fort Hamilton with another base a half-mile away, a Confederate mine and a piece of the net that protected New York Harbor from German U-boats in World War I.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DD1630F930A35751C0A967958260|title=If You're Thinking of Living in: Fort Hamilton|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1991-02-03|author=Jerry Cheslow|work=The New York Times[/tpl] It is also the temporary home of a Bay Ridge time capsule that was unearthed prematurely due to construction.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/11/13/2007-11-13_time_capsule_relics_unearthed_47_years_t-1.html|title=Time Capsule Relics Unearthed 47 Years too Early|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=2007-11-13|author=Matthew Lysiak|work=Daily News[/tpl]

Lil' Red is one of two mascots at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's athletics teams.  Lil' Red is the newest mascot, having been created for the 1993 season after a state wide contest run for that purpose. Associate athletic director Dr. Barbara Hibner was the driving force in the creation of Lil' Red.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=462&SPID=41&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=261  
He can be seen on the sidelines of a Nebraska football game at Memorial Stadium, at the Bob Devaney Sports Center during basketball games and at volleyball games. The mascot is currently produced by Signs and Shapes International, Inc. based in Omaha, Nebraska. The wearer of the costume wears a "PowerBelt," a belt with an air circulation system, which brings in over [tpl]convert|100|cuft|m3[/tpl] of fresh outside air per minute. This is enough fresh air to accommodate roughly 1,000 people. Due to the mascot's incredibly light weight, the larger-than-life mascot can run, dance, crowd surf and shake hands.  
Since its installment, Lil' Red has won two major awards. The first was the national championship at the NCAA National Mascot Competition in 1999.  The second one was an induction into the 2007 Mascot Hall of Fame, which selected its winners by an online vote.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=462&SPID=41&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=218533

[[Amiran-Darejaniani]]

CATEGORIES: 12th-century books, Middle Georgian literature

Amiran-Darejaniani ([tpl]lang-ka|ამირანდარეჯანიანი[/tpl]), translated into English as "The story of Amiran, son of Darejan", is a medieval Georgian romance, dating probably from the early or middle decades of the twelfth century. It is one of those literary works which heralded the emergence of native secular literature after several centuries of domination by patristic tradition. It is a prose tale of battling knights in twelve episodes attributed to Moses of Khoni (Mose Khoneli; მოსე ხონელი). This attribution is found in the epilogue of Vep’khis-tqaosani, an epic poem by Shota Rustaveli, the greatest classic of medieval Georgian literature, and is otherwise unknown. A tradition holds it that Moses came from the town of Khoni in western Georgia, and, like Rustaveli, served at the court of Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), who presided over the Georgian "Golden Age".[tpl]ka icon[/tpl] Imedashvili (1966)
Amiran-Darejaniani was first published by the self-educated Georgian literary critic and bibliophile Zakaria Chichinadze in 1896, followed by several critical editions in the 20th century. The epos was first introduced to the English-speaking world through a translation by Robert Horne Stevenson in 1958.Stevenson, Robert Horne (1958), "Amiran-Darejaniani".

Fernand Charron (30 May 1866 in Angers – 13 August 1928 in Maisons-Laffitte) was a French pioneer of motor racing and automobile manufacturing. He started his sporting career as a successful cyclist.
In 1891 he won the French National Stayers Championships riding a bicycle around a track following a tandem.
Between 1897 and 1903 he took part in 18 car races, 4 of which he won: 1898 Marseille–Nice and 1898 Paris–Amsterdam–Paris in 1898, Paris–Bordeaux in 1899 and the inaugural Gordon Bennett Cup (Paris–Lyon) in 1900. He drove mainly Panhard & Levassor cars. 
On one occasion, he crashed into a St Bernard dog which became wedged between the right wheel and the suspension and jammed the steering, though he still won the race.Historic racing He retired after an unsuccessful season in 1903 and worked as manager of Adolphe Clément's factory complex at Levallois-Perret.
In 1901 Fernand Charron was one of the three founders of an automobile manufacturer called Charron, Girardot et Voigt (CGV).[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1920 (salon Oct 1919)| volume = Nr. 31| pages = Pages 64 - 65|year = 2004|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl]  Following resignations the company was reformed in 1906 at Puteaux as Charron Ltd., the English "Ltd" suffix reflecting a large amount of investment capital that came from England.  Shortly before the outbreak, in 1914, of the First World War Charron was trying to sell his auto-business, but he nevertheless was also using it at this time to build cars for the Alda company.   The outbreak of peace found Carron still in ownership of the business which at the  Paris Motor Show in October 1919 was offering two models, the small 6HP "Type TC" (derived from the "Charronette" of 1914) and the 15HP "Type PGM".
Charron married in 1907, and later divorced, Jeanne Clément, the second daughter of cycle and motor manufacturer Adolphe Clément.Hydro Retro, Clement-Bayard, pdf (French) Clément-Bayard, sans peur et sans reproche par Gérard Hartmann

Paul "Okie Paul" Westmoreland (September 19, 1916 – June 21, 2005) was a musician, songwriter, and disc jockey in Sacramento, California.Gregory, American Exodus, p. 230: "Moving to Los Angeles, he spent the war years performing, writing songs, and sometimes working in defense plants. 1946 found him in Sacramento with his own fifteen-minute morning radio program. Next he opened a club. 'I built me a beer joint and got behind the bar with my guitar and sold beer and sang.' The place prospered, and 'Okie Paul' became a permanent fixture in Sacramento's country-music scene."
Born in Oklahoma, he moved to California during the Okie migration.Pew, "Route 66": "From the status of independent farmers, they had fallen to that of cheap labor, and Sacramento’s Paul Westmoreland—or 'Okie Paul,' as he is known to radio listeners throughout central California—is one of them. He was a teen-ager when he made the first run out of Oklahoma with his family. “We was starved out in 1929,” he recalls, ...“ 
As a songwriter he is best known for "Detour (There's A Muddy Road Ahead)", written in 1945, which became a big hit for Spade Cooley and was afterwards covered by Patti Page and many others. Other songs by Westmoreland include, "Lordy, Oh Lord" (1952), "Save The Pieces" (1953), and "What's Another Broken Heart To You?" (1953, with Joe Hobson).
He also recorded for Decca Records and toured with his own band in 1954.  Included in his band was bass player Raymond "Cousin Ray" Woolfenden.  Woolfenden was elected to the Country Radio DJ Hall of Fame in 1999.

Arthur H. Pitney (1871-1933) was an American inventor best known as the father of the postage meter.  
Postage meters are used today by millions of businesses to imprint postage on envelopes and parcels.  Meter indicia serve as proof of payment, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation mark, and a dated postmark all in one. 
Pitney filed a patent application, in Stamford, Connecticut for the world’s first postage meter on Dec. 9, 1901.  He presented, demonstrated and perfected his invention over two decades – but it was not until he partnered with English-born industrialist Walter Bowes that the postage meter was approved by the U.S. Postal Service.
He co-founded the Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company in 1920.  Today, the company that bears his name, Pitney Bowes, is a $6.1 billion provider of software, hardware and services related to documents, packaging, mailing and shipping, collectively referred to as the mailstream.
Pitney’s invention, the Pitney Bowes Model M Postage Meter has been recognized as an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

[[Patrick Hamilton (poet)]]
CATEGORIES: Scottish clergy, Church of Scotland, Ministers of the Church of Scotland, Alumni of the University of Glasgow, Scottish poets, 1575 births, 1658 deaths, Cambuslang

Patrick Hamilton (c. 1575 – May 1658) was a minister of The Church of Scotland during a turbulent period in Scotland’s history. He seems to have chosen the wrong side in the dispute between King Charles I and the Scottish Covenanters. He was also a poet, writing in a straightforward English (as opposed to Scots) style, expressing his religious and political beliefs, and longing for a period of peace.
In 1596 he was Minister at Lochwinnoch then in 1607 he moved to Paisley. In 1626 he was presented to the Parish of Cambuslang by James, Marquis of Hamilton, a significant player in Scottish politics. Patrick may not have been related to the family, but his connection to the Marquis of Hamilton was to cost him his career and he was to die in obscure poverty.
Hamilton sets out his religious position in a poem called "A Schort Description of the Trew Properties of a Faithful Sheiphard of Christes Flock". It is unapologetically a Protestant Calvinist position.
He has little time for rituals, prelates or hypocrisy. On the other hand, he seems to have a more moderate, or at least conservative, outlook than many clergy at the time.
His own approach to his ministry is clear
Nonetheless, Patrick was a member of the momentous General Assembly of the Church of Scotland which met in Glasgow in 1638 and proclaimed the National Covenant, abolished bishops and established Presbyterianism as the form of government for the Church of Scotland. This set them on a collision course with King Charles I which would lead to the Civil Wars and the execution of the King.
Hamilton not only supported, and signed, the National Covenant but wrote a long poem in support of it, Some Few Verses in Commendatione of the Covenant and subscribers thereto. However, his patron was James, Marquis of Hamilton, who was one of the leaders of the King’s forces sent to Scotland to face the gathering Covenanter armies. The Marquis arrived off Leith in May 1639 and Patrick may have joined him there. There is a letter from the Marquis to the King’s Commissioner, the Earl of Rothes, headed "From aboord the Rainbow, in Leith Road, 23 Maij 1639" to which there is attached a footnote, which is a poem "Verses on the Rainbow by Patrick Hamilton, Minister of Cambuslang". In fact there is only one verse of seven rhyming couplets, sadly contrasting the natural rainbow - a promise of peace - with the Rainbow carrying the promise of war. Not long afterwards, the Covenanter army was told to disperse at Duns. It did not, but proceeded into England, eventually leading to a (short-lived) Treaty with the King. Patrick wrote a short poem called "Upon the Scottish army at Dunce Law June 18th 1639". He seems to have seen this as some sort of victory against the "Cold Covenanters and base cowards all" and looks forward to the restoration of order.
He later wrote two verses "To the English Nobles" beginning "You worthie English nobles of renown", thanking them for defeating the Covenanters.
He did not like the news of the Covenanter success in the North. He wrote a one verse poem called "Upon the deceitful Covenanted in and about Aberdeen", declaring "Boyne, Banf and Breichen, Satan’s viperous brood" and lambasting
But he still seems to think 1639 was a turning point for peace and wrote in "Upon the blessed lot of '39 Year" that "our fiercest foes, Our Lord made faithful friends" and looked forward to a time when all would be
In 1641 he wrote "Scotland’s Thanksgiving to the Lord for her armies safe, joyful and ponderous returning from England", perhaps realising how things were really playing out.
Other poems known to have been written by Patrick Hamilton are "A Poem on the Creation, Fall and Redemption of Mankind", where he signs himself "A Curate on the Clyde", and (apparently) a translation of Zachary Boyd's "Christian Hecatomb".
In 1645 his name was found on a list of persons offered "protection" from the King’s armies (presumably because of his connection with the Marquis). Because of this he was deposed by the General Assembly. He petitioned to be reinstated and the Assembly was just about to do so when, according to a letter from Robert Baillie who was present, Patrick "let fall out of his pocket a poem too invective against the Church's proceedings. This, by a mere accident, came into the hands of Mr Murdo Law, who gave it to Mr James Guthrie, and he did read it to the Assembly, to Mr Patrick’s confusion". He was not reinstated, and died in extreme poverty in May 1658. His wife Katherine and children (one of whom, his son Patrick, was at the University) were given help by the Kirk Session of Cambuslang in January 1659 and June 1662 (just at the time of the Restoration, two years too late for Patrick). There was a collection among churches in Lothian in October 1660 for her "on account of her necessitous and indigent condition, especially considering she is a minister’s relict, and a minister’s daughter, and has the approbation of a good Christian". The following year she got £60 from Parliament, and there the record ends.

Hamine was born 20 February 1906 in Imbulgoda, Gampaha. She was by profession a school teacher until a chance encounter with G. D. L. Perera when she accompanied a young actress to a theatrical audition, led to her winning the role of an elderly mother in Perera's play Kandulu. Due to her masterful performance in the role,  Perera brought Hamine into his drama group Kala Pela; she would play in Kala Pela productions like Manamalayo, Sakkarawattang and Sama (as Nonnohamy) and was honored with a merit award at the 1964 Arts Council Drama Festival for her role in Totupola.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/021215/plus/6.html|title=Golden memories of grand old lady of the silver screen|accessdate=2008-04-30|year=2002|publisher=Wijeya Newspapers[/tpl]
Hamine's debut film role was in the film adaption of Sama (1965) by Perera reprising the role she had popularized in the play. In Sath Samudura (1968) she played the mother of two fishermen to much critical rave. She was presented a Best Character Actress Award for the role by a special government council. It was delivered on stage by the then Sri Lankan prime minister Dudley Senanayake.

Chief Sagwitch, his name meant "Orator",  (1822– March 20, 1887) was born in 1822 on the lower Bear River (in today's Box Elder County, Utah). He was a nineteenth-century chieftain of a band of Northwestern Shoshone that converted to Mormonism.  His group were the ones killed in the Bear River Massacre.  Sagwitch himself was injured in the massacre but survived.
In 1873, Sagwitch was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by George Washington Hill.  The rest of Sagwitch's band, totalling about 100 people, were also baptized into the LDS Church.  Sagwitch was also ordained an elder in the church.  
In 1875, Sagwitch and his wife were sealed in the Endowment House. Wilford Woodruff performed the ordinance.  
In 1880, Sagwitch and his band settled Washakie, Utah. They operated a farm here. They also contributed large amounts of labor towards the building of the Logan Utah Temple.
Sagwitch's son, Frank W. Warner, who was born Pisappih "Red Oquirrh" Timbimboo, but largely raised by the Amos Warner family after his mother was killed during the Bear River Massacre, was one of the earliest Native Americans to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church.  Sagwitch's grandson Moroni Timbimboo was the first Native American to serve as a bishop in the church.
A biography of Sagwitch by Scott R. Christensen entitled Sagwitch: Shoshone Chieftain, Mormon Elder, 1822-1887 was published by Utah State University Press in 1999.

[[Fixed verse]]

CATEGORIES: Poetic form, Literature lists

Fixed verse forms are a kind of template or formula that poetry can be composed in. The opposite of Fixed verse is Free verse poetry, which by design has little or no pre-established guidelines.
The various poetic forms, such as meter, rhyme scheme, and stanzas guide and limit a poet's choices when composing poetry. A fixed verse form combines one or more of these limitations into a larger form.
A form usually demands strict adherence to the established guidelines that to some poets may seem stifling, while other poets view the  rigid structure as a challenge to be innovative and creative while staying within the guidelines.

[tpl]Other people2|William Pitt (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]William Pitt[/tpl]

William Hill Pitt (August 16, 1813 – February 21, 1873) was a prominent bandleader in the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His band, known as the Nauvoo Brass Band, was the main band in Nauvoo, Illinois, and played an important role in the crossing of Iowa during the Mormon pioneer trek.
Pitt was born in Dymock, England. He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1840. By 1842, Pitt had moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. There he organized a band that originally served as a band for the Nauvoo Legion but soon expanded to performing at a full array of community events.
During the Mormons' trek across Iowa in 1846, Pitt's band not only helped to keep people happy with its music but also raised money by holding ticketed events in communities through which they passed.
Pitt was in the original group to go to the Salt Lake Valley with Brigham Young in 1847.  In 1852, Pitt served as a missionary in England for the LDS Church. Although his band existed in Utah Territory it was not as prominent as it had been previously.

As Standard Liège had the same amount of points and the same amount of matches won, test matches were organised to determine the winner. Anderlecht drew 1-1 at home but then lost 1-0 at Standard and thus ended in second position. In the cup they were eliminated in the early rounds by KV Mechelen, who progressed on to lose the final.
Anderlecht also played in the UEFA Champions League, but failed to progress through the qualifying rounds and also did not qualify for the UEFA Cup as they went out too soon. They also played in the Belgian Supercup as cup-winners, but lost, again to Standard.

Kameya's original surname was Abe ([tpl]nihongo2|阿部[/tpl]); he was adopted by a family named Kameya.Abe, adoption: Nihon no shashinka, s.v. "Kameya Tokujirō". He learned photography at Deshima, the Dutch enclave in the harbour of Nagasaki where physicians Jan Karel van den Broek and J. L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort taught photography in addition to medicine and chemistry. In turn, Kameya taught photography to Tomishige Rihei, who became his apprentice in 1862. The same year, Kameya moved to Kyoto to open a photographic studio – the first commercial studio in the city. In 1868, he returned to Nagasaki, where he operated a studio until his death. He died in 1884 in Vladivostok, having opened a branch studio there.
Kameya had a daughter, Kameya Toyo ([tpl]nihongo2|龜谷とよ[/tpl],In modern orthography [tpl]nihongo2|亀谷とよ[/tpl]. 1852–1885), who assisted him in his Nagasaki studio and was one of Japan's first woman photographers.

Kameya Tokujirō may have opened his Nagasaki studio before his 1862 move to Kyoto, and if so it may predate that of Ueno Hikoma as the earliest in the city.

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems, nutritional status and food security, and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

CATEGORIES: Music events, Music of Cleveland, Ohio, 2008 in Ohio, 2008 in American music

The Lottery League 2008 was a musical event that took place from February 2 through April 12 in Cleveland, Ohio.
The organizers of the event, a group of Cleveland musicians known as "the Council of Chiefs", held a lottery wherein roughly 150 musicians were placed in 33 semi-randomly generated bands.  One of the few guidelines was that none of the people in the bands were to have played with, worked with, or had "intimate relationships" with one another.
The Lottery League 2008 began with a Draft Night.  Shortly thereafter, the participants had 10 weeks to create and rehearse music to be performed at Cleveland music venue Beachland Ballroom and Tavern.  The showcase was given the name of The Big Show, and would feature all participating bands on three stages within the span of six hours.  This show took place on April 12, 2008, to a crowd of several hundred people.
As part of the Lottery League 2008, each band was to submit recordings for their work.  Additionally, video and photo footage of band rehearsals, interviews, and footage from the Big Show was also taken.  All of these will be gathered into a special CD/DVD release, slated for Fall 2008.
While many Lottery League groups made no plans to continue performing beyond the night of the Big Show, others have chosen to forge ahead, writing songs, booking shows, and recording more new music.

Later, he and some other accused were transferred to Dhaka (Kurmitola) Cantonment. Members of public looked at the case as a conspiracy of the Pakistan government against the political autonomy movement of East Pakistan. They organised mass movement and demanded immediate withdrawal of the case and release of all prisoners. According to the government decision, the final date for the case was 6 February 1969. But because of the mass upsurge of 1969, the government had to defer the date. In the morning of 15 February 1969, a Pakistani habildar shot point blank at Sergeant Zahurul Haq at the door of his cell in the jail. He was taken to the Combined Military Hospital. There he died at around 10 pm. The news of the killing led a furious mob to set fire to the State Guest House and other government buildings.

[[Optical granulometry]]
CATEGORIES: Mining, Image processing

Optical granulometry is the process of measuring the different grain sizes in a granular material,Definition of granularity at GEMET based on a photograph.  Technology has been created to analyze a photograph and create statistics based on what the picture portrays.  This information is vital in maintaining machinery in various trades worldwide.  Mining companies can use optical granulometry to analyze inactive or moving rock to quantify the size of these fragments.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 68  Forestry companies can zero in on wood chip sizes without stopping the production process, and minimize sizing errors.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 47
With more photoanalysis technologies being produced, mining companies have shown an increased interest in these types of systems because of their ability to maintain efficiency throughout the mining process.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 258 Companies are saving millions of dollars annually because of this new technology, and are cutting back on maintenance costs on equipment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In order for optical granulometry to be completely successful, an accurate photo must be taken – under sufficient lighting, and using proper[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2009[/tpl] technology – to obtain quantified results.(Franklin and Katsabanis 1996), page 115 If these requirements are met, an image analysis system can be implemented.

[[Wolfgang von Weisl]]

CATEGORIES: 1896 births, 1974 deaths, People from Vienna, Austrian Jews

Binyamin Ze'ev (Wolfgang) von Weisl (1896–1974) was one of the founders of the Revisionist movement and a leader in the Zionist struggle for establishing a Jewish state. He was writer and a journalist, a physician and medical researcher, a military man and an original military strategist, an Austrian noble and a world expert in Islam.
Dr. Wolfgang von Weisl was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1896. His father, Dr. Ernst Von Weisl, who received the ennobling predicate "von" from Emperor Franz Josef, was among the first Jews to join Theodor Herzl in his Zionist movement. For his son, Wolfgang, this was a call to the flag, and a cause to which he dedicated his life. For Weisl, junior, Zionism meant living in what is now called the land of Israel (and then Palestine), participation in its building and defence, and the struggle to ensure its independence toward the Return of Zion.
At the age of 11 (1907) Dr. Wolfgang von Weisl launched his Zionist path with his first political article with a call to transport Yemenite Jews to the land of Israel. The article was published in the Wiener Handelsblatt.
In 1914, in the midst of his medical studies, he served as an artillery officer in the Austo-Hungary army, earned the Iron Cross Medal, destributed the Jewish national colors of blue and white to Jewish officers, and established a Jewish corps for the defense of the Jewish quarter.
His work with the Jewish National Fund brought him in touch with Zeev Jabotinsky, then a leading man in Keren Hayesod. Weisl proposed to buy a whole Korpus' gear and armament for 60,000 Lira; to transport 30,000 pioneers and to conquer the Land of Israel. This proposal set Weisl's ideology and heritage: Weisl believed that Israel could survive on the condition that it had a strong army and kept to the historical borders – the only defensible borders.
In 1922, right after he completed his medical studies in the University of Vienna, Weisl immigrated to the Holy Land and received a Palestine passport. When, four decades later, he was asked by the Austrian ambassador to Israel why he had not returned to the "beloved Vienna" after the war? Weisl answered: "When I was a medical student in Vienna graffiti on the walls and doors of the toilets called: "Jews out!".  And I always read toilet literature seriously."
In 1925, together with Yaakov and Abraham Weinschel, Rozof and several other, Weisl founded the Revisionist Party in Eretz Israel.
In 1924 Wolfgang von Weisl launched a career as the representative of Ullstein, the lucrative publication house, to the Near East and the Islamic countries. His articles are translated and published all over the world. He was considered a world specialist in Islam and was listed in The Statesman's Year Book year after year.
Weisl was welcome at Kings' and Saahs' courts: He was received by the Khalif, Hussein, the Hedjazi king – when he was a king, and was the only European to have dined with the Khalif at his last royal meal, before his forced exiled. He was a guest of King Ibn Saud, stayed at the home of the Sultan El Atrash, the leader of the Druze's insurgency, was in the palace of the Emir Abdallah of Trans Jordan and his personal doctor, he was the personal and official guide and dragoman of King Fuad of Egypt during his state visit in Germany, and visited Jebel Druze during the rebellion. He could have made a great difference in what would later become the Israeli Palestinian conflict: He offered Feisal, King of Iraq, a transfer of Palestinian Arabs to cultivate his vast unpopulated lands, received the king's blessing but encountered British objections. In Egypt he befriended Zaglul Pasha who hoped that the Zionists would sit on the Eastern shore of the Suez Canal understanding what the British refused to understand … Sinai did not belong to Egypt then.
In 1929, at the time of the Feat of Purim, Dr. von Weisl was invited on the legendary Zeppelin trip from Berlin to the Mediterranean.  On board were five German ministers, an Egyptian journalist, Graf Zeppelin's widow and other international public figures. Dr. Herman Badet, of the Prussian Interior Ministry, a religious Jew, read together with Weisl Ester Scroll while the Zeppelin hovered above the city of Tel Aviv to the excited cheers of the crowd below. Above the Dead Sea Weisl opened a Carmel Mizrahi bottle of wine and the travelers toasted the "People of Israel and their homeland".
A few months later, during the bloody disturbances of August 1929, Weisl was stabbed by an Arab and was thought dead. Eulogies are published around the world and in one of them he is mentioned as the Mark Twain of the German language, postcards with his picture are sold, trees are planted in his honor and prayers are given for his recovery. He survived and testified in front of the Shaw committee.
In 1931 von Weisl called to prepare for world war and predicted the rise of Hitler, calling on the Jews to save themselves. During this time he was active against the partition of what was left of the land of Israel – after a great portion was separated and given to Hussein. In 1935 Weisl proposed illegal immigration to Palestine and, overruling Jabotinsky's opposition, raised the funds needed for the first "illegal" immigrants' ship "Af Al Pi" (Despite).
On 1 September 1946, jailed in Latrun, Weisl wrote to the British High commissioner: "… I have the honor to inform you that I shall abstain from taking food for a period of 28 days… I am well aware of the fact that neither my fasting nor that of anybody else will influence the attitude or the decisions of the men who rule today over Palestine and who, apparently, regard it as their duty to hinder by all means the return of Israel to its Home…" and turned from an unusual and controversial leader – even in his own party – to a national hero.
On 25 February 1974, a day after his death, and in March 1974 Weisl's last 2 articles were published, sealing his intellectual activity which encompassed thousands of articles and lectures and several books in different subjects: politics, military, medicine, theology, philosophy, psychology, travel… and even astrology. His series about Saint Theresia Neumann was published in a special edition and 800,000 copies were sold in a few days.
"one of the most fascinating and picturesque characters", "the story of his life can fill a few volumes", "legends surrounded him", "the man with the golden pen", "a genius", "a prophet", but also "a charlatan", "Don Quixote", "an adventurer" and "a fascist". A man about whom it has been written: “There is only one ism that fits Dr. von Weisl – vonweislism”

The Maryhill Loops Road was an experimental road in south central Washington, United States, built by Good Roads promoter Samuel Hill with the help of engineer and landscape architect Samuel C. Lancaster. Climbing the Columbia Hills from the Columbia River and Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway to his planned Quaker utopian community at Maryhill, Washington. Built in 1911 as the first asphalt road in the state, and bypassed by the present U.S. Route 97 after World War II, the road achieved low grades with horseshoe curves. The design became the model for the Figure-Eight Loops on the Historic Columbia River Highway in Oregon, designed by Lancaster several years later.Robert W. Hadlow, Ph.D., Historian, Oregon Department of Transportation, National Historic Landmark Nomination: Columbia River Highway, February 4, 2000, pp. 54-56, 59-61 The road is now owned by the Maryhill Museum of Art.
The road is closed to public motor vehicle traffic but is open to pedestrians and bicycles. The Maryhill Museum of Art rents use of the road for private events by automobile, motorcycle, bicycling, and longboarding clubs.

[[Price of anarchy]]

CATEGORIES: Game theory

The Price of Anarchy (PoA) E. Koutsoupias, C. H. Papadimitriou Worst-case equilibria, STACS 99 is a concept in game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency. For example, consider the system of transportation of a city and many agents trying to go from some initial location to a destination. Let efficiency in this case mean the average time for an agent to reach the destination. In the 'centralized' solution, a central authority can tell each agent which path to take in order to minimize the average travel time. In the 'decentralized' version, each agent chooses its own path. The Price of Anarchy measures the ratio between average travel time in the two cases.
Usually the system is modeled as a game and the efficiency is some function of the outcomes (e.g. maximum delay in a network, congestion in a transportation system, social welfare in an auction, ...). Different concepts of equilibrium can be used to model the selfish behavior of the agents, among which the most common is the Nash equilibrium. Different flavors of Nash equilibrium lead to variations of the notion of Price of Anarchy as Pure Price of Anarchy (for deterministic equilibria), Mixed Price of Anarchy (for randomized equilibria), Bayes-Nash Price of Anarchy (for games with incomplete information), ... Other notions, other than Nash equilibria, lead to variations of the concept, as the Price of Sinking.M. Goemans, V. Mirrokni, A. Vetta, Sink equilibria and convergence, FOCS 05
The term Price of Anarchy was first used by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou, but the idea of measuring inefficiency of equilibrium is older.P. Dubey. Inefficiency of Nash equilibria. Math. Operat. Res., 11(1):1–8, 1986 The concept in its current form was designed to be the analogue of the 'approximation ratio' in an approximation algorithm or the 'competitive ratio' in an online algorithm. This is in the context of the current trend of analyzing games using algorithmic lenses (algorithmic game theory).

[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KRIO |title=KRIO Facility Record |work=United States Federal Communications Commission, audio division [/tpl]
KRIO has a long and colorful history.  During the 1960s and early 1970s, it was "The Big 9-10," a Top 40 formatted station emphasizing fun promotions and popular personalities in a fast-paced presentation with station jingles and other production elements.  It was one of the top stations in south Texas until it was challenged first by KRGV-AM "The Enormous 129" licensed to Weslaco and then KBFM-FM "KB-104" licensed to Edinburg.  Toward the end of the decade KRIO was managed by Charlie Trub who started two stations in the Valley, KRIX-FM and XHRIO-TV.  KRIX was an automated album oriented rock station on 99.5 FM in Brownsville, while XHRIO broadcast on Channel 2 from El Control, Tamaulipas but originated its programs from studios adjacent to the KRIO radio station in McAllen.
KRIO was purchased by Henry Tippie from Charlie Trub. Tippie already owned KVLY FM, formerly KESI FM, in Edinburg, Texas. Tippie had hoped to regain KRIO's popularity with a "Classic" oldies format playing "The music you grew up with".  After a few years, when the station was not performing as expected, the station was donated to the Rio Grande Bible Institute as a tax write off.
KRIO's programming is also heard on KRIO-FM 97.7 FM in Roma, Texas and KOIR 88.5 FM in Edinburg, Texas.

Saint Manchán mac Silláin (died 664), Manchianus in Latin sources, is the name of an early Irish saint, patron of Liath Mancháin, now Lemanaghan, in County Offaly.Stalmans and Charles-Edwards, "Meath, saints of (act. c.400–c.900)". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.Breen, "Manchán, Manchianus, Manchíne". Dictionary of Irish Biography. He is not to be confused with the scholar Manchán or Manchéne, abbot of Min Droichit (Co. Offaly).
There are variant traditions concerning the saint's pedigree, possibly owing to confusion with one of several churchmen named Manchán or Mainchín. The most reliable genealogy makes him a son of Sillán son of Conall, who is said be a descendant of Rudraige Mór of Ulster, and names his mother Mella.

Martín Zurbano Baras (February 29, 1788 – January 21, 1845) was a Spanish military figure.  A guerrilla leader, he is considered a "martyr to Spanish liberty".Martín Zurbano: mártir de la libertad - bermemar
Born in Varea, La Rioja, the youngest of four siblings, he fought in the War of Spanish Independence as a guerrilla.  With future generals like Francisco Espoz y Mina, he defended the Constitution of 1812, and helped create the province of Logroño.
He then fought in First Carlist War on the Liberal (Isabeline) side and rose to the rank of field marshal.  A British article written in 1840 describes his role in this war: "In time of peace a contrabandista, or smuggler, he soon after the commencement of the war sought and obtained permission to raise a body of men to act in conjunction with the queen’s troops against the Carlists.  His standard, once displayed, was resorted to by smugglers, robbers, and outcasts of all descriptions, attracted by the prospect of plunder and adventure.  These were increased by deserters...""A Night Excursion with Martin Zurbano," Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. 48, July–December 1840 (T. Cadell and W. Davis, 1840), 740.
Zurbano commanded the force known as the Compañía de Tiradores de Alava (founded 1833), which had been joined with the Partida de Contra aduaneros (Anti-aduanero Party), and was known as the Partida de la Muerte (Party of Death).  By 1836, the force was known as Batallón de Voluntarios de la Rioja Alavesa and was disbanded in 1840.
He was an ardent follower of Baldomero Espartero, who named him military governor of Girona and commander general of Biscay in 1840.  Zurbano participated in the bombardment of Barcelona in 1843.
Zurbano suppressed the moderado faction in Biscay in 1841, and fought against Juan Prim in Catalonia (1843).
He fled to Portugal after the fall of Espartero, but Isabel II granted him a pardon.  In 1844, he led a revolt with 80 men who advocated the adoption of the Constitution of 1837 (Grito de Nájera) and the return of Espartero.  It included the support of key generals, including Juan Prim.  Zurbano was imprisoned by Ramón María Narváez.
He was arrested and executed by firing squad, along with his sons Benito and Feliciano, by order of Narváez.

Ramzi Khoury (born June 3, 1978), also known as RAmez, is a French rap artist of Lebanese descent. He sings  in French, English and Arabic.  In 2007 at a time where few people believed French Rap had a place in the Middle East, Ramez makes it to the NRJ Lebanon Top 100 by reaching number 24  with his hit song Leich Heik Baladé a song mixing French and Arabic and alongside international artists such as Mika, Britney Spears, Shakira, Timbaland, Linkin Park and James Blunt.[ref]Local Music Scenes and Globalization Thomas Burkhalter - 2013 - Preview - More editions
24 Lebanese rapper Ramez (Ramzi Khoury) lives in Paris today. He reached the highest rap sales at Virgin Megastores in 2007 and became the first Lebanese rapper to hit the top charts on NRJ (Nouvelle Radio Jeunesse) with the Lebanese ..."[/ref]
In 2008, the song Is it too much asking also from RAmez's second CD was played on Lebanon's Radio One and the controversial video in relation to that song is widely viewed on Youtube as a result.
Over the last three years, thanks to the release of RAmez's CD and its success, French Rap has become popular in the region while opportunities for independent artists / producer have increased in the Arab world.
In 2005 RAmez had been noticed by a French label and a Lebanese producer.  He ended up choosing to have his second CD produced in Lebanon in order to contribute to the development of the independent music scene in his country of origin.  The nickname "RAmez" was chosen a little bit after September 11 to stress on the importance of digging in the past to understand the present.
In 2001, RAmez hosted a number of radio shows in the United States promoting French rap as well as American rap.  He also released the same year his first album with an innovative and original concept consisting on mixing the French and Lebanese dialect together to put French Rap, Lebanon and the Arab world on the same map (which was not always well perceived in the United States at the time).  In a song called "Le monde est à refaire" and released in 2001 the concept behind Ramez's work is shared within his lyrics "Ramez symbole critiqué de par son phrasé ayant qu'un seul but exister pour éclairer tout les révoltés.  Unis prenant le concept de mondialisation, dotés d'une potion provenant direct de la raison, des connaissances amassées que nous venons distribuer, Libanais / Francais nos forces sont à présent décuplées".  The strength resulting from this project portraying many different culture and languages allows two tracks extracted of this first multi-cultural project to appear on a compilation exclusively distributed in the United States: Ma Flamme and Y'aura pas de paix (in which RAmez mixes French English and Lebanese rap to express his cultural background and origins). Released just after September 11, 2001 Le monde est à refaire with the talk show Extension 1312 RAmez hosts and produces at that time, created together a certain amount of controversy adding to the debate at University campuses across America.  In 1999, RAmez had already appeared on a compilation untitled My world to express the stereotypes used by western media to portray a distorted view of Arabs worldwide in a track called Taste of Rage and featuring Armagideon.
In 1989, in France, Ramzi started actively supporting Lebanon by being selected as one of the "enfants libres" to sing, alongside Guy Beart, the chorus of the song Liban Libre.
RAmez continued to promote Peace in Lebanon as a radio host on France FM & Radio Nostalgie and by breaking rules when necessary to get a message of Peace get across.
At the end of the year 2007, RAmez's first CD was released throughout Lebanon reaching number one in relation to sales at the Virgin Megastore in Lebanon - an unexpected and unprecedented success for Rap in Lebanon that will lead the music industry to criticize Ramez's work and close in an organized matter many doors on him.
In November 2007 in France, RAmez contributed an unreleased song called, Un monde de fou (A crazy world), to a French Rap Mixtape that he chose to distribute for free on his website.  This song came to the attention of Radio Orient in 2008 who then broadcast it across France.
Ramez preferred not to renew his contract in Lebanon in order to produce his own material without external influences with the aim of reaching a more international audience.  In 2009 Ramez set up RAMEZ Productions (RAP) through which he intends to manage his music and other projects.  Ramez is currently working on his third album after 11 years of International work on Radio and Rap.

thumb|alt=A color photograph of a man in glasses with thinning reddish-brown hair and a full beard, holding a microphone and wearing a name badge.John Meyer is a pioneer in the sound reinforcement industry. In 1979 he founded Meyer Sound Laboratories with his wife, Helen Meyer.
John Meyer grew up in Berkeley, California. His earliest involvement with audio was in the late 50s hanging out at the local radio station KPFA. He received a radiotelephone third class license at 12 years old, and a second class license when he was 15.Doctor ProAudio: Interview With John Meyer He attended Oakland High which was one of the first schools in the country to have an audio department. In the audio department he would build consoles and other audio devicesThat San Francisco Sound: How the 60s Brought Audio Manufacturers to the Bay Area
John Meyer started his career in 1967 working in a Berkeley hi-fi store doing custom installs. There he met Steve Miller who was looking to outfit his band. John Meyer assembled a custom amplification system for The Steve Miller Band when they appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival.Necessity Mothers Invention John worked with Jim Meagher of Meagher Electronics at the Monterey Pop Festival.
Soon after John Meyer started a company called Glyph to design and build sound reinforcement systems. Glyph's first installation was at a San Rafael club called Pepperland. It was a pure exponential horn-loaded bi-amped quadraphonic sound system. Each stack included a white fiberglass bass, mid-range and hi frequency horns. The bass horns were huge, measuring 8×8 feet with 30-inch drivers. This system was used from 1969 until 1970 when Pepperland closed down.An Interview With John Meyer
In 1971 he started working for McCune Sound Service. McCune was interested in building reliable transportable sound systems. While at McCune John first realized his idea of a fully integrated loudspeaker system. The system was built for Creedence Clearwater Revival's last tour. It was a fully integrated tri-amped, horn-loaded system with processing electronics.Transcript PSW LIVE CHAT with John Meyer Three amps were built into a rack mountable enclosure that would drive two speakers. The enclosure also included preset cross-overs and equalization. The outside of the enclosure was simple: an AC cord, input connectors, and 4-pin connectors that plugged into the loudspeakers. The original model did not have level controls or a power switch.
While at McCune, John Meyer started doing sound reinforcement work with outdoor classical music symphony concerts at Stanford University. This led to an involvement with the Institute of Advanced Music Studies in Montreux, Switzerland which was exploring the idea of building a high quality sound reinforcement system for classical music. In 1973, he was invited to establish an acoustics lab and perform research at the Institute. One of his primary goals was to research the origins of non-linearity in audio transducers. He spent one and a half years in Switzerland. While there, he designed a modular loudspeaker system and a high-frequency horn driver that led directly to some of the initial innovations at Meyer Sound Laboratories.
During the early 1970s, Meyer was involved with the Grateful Dead, providing them audio advice and performing audio research and experimentation with Don Pearson and Owsley Stanley.In Memoriam of Don Pearson
In the 1970s, Meyer met his future wife Helen, a neighbor in Berkeley. John and Helen's first official date was to the high-end hi-fi store in Berkeley he was working at to listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on a pair of Klipsch horns. This was Helen's first introduction to quality sound reproduction.Q & A: Helen
John and Helen founded Meyer Sound Laboratories in 1979 after his return from Switzerland. The company was started in San Leandro, California and then moved to Berkeley California.
In 2005, Meyer was made a Fellow of the Audio Engineering Society, and in 2007, he was awarded the organization's Silver Medal.AES 123rd Convention. Special Events. Awards.

Francis "Frank" Harris (born 5 April 1908, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. He was born in Catshill.
Harris began his football career at non-league sides Cradley Heath and Bromsgrove Rovers while working as a mechanic. In 1928 he signed for Cardiff City, scoring on his home debut in a 2-1 win over Leicester City. It took him several years to fully establish himself in the side as numerous minor injuries forced him in and out of the first team before missing just two games during the 1931-32 season. In 1933 he was sold to Charlton Athletic, who were also suffering from a slump in recent years but Harris was part of the team that helped the club win two consecutive promotions to return to the top flight. After leaving Charlton he finished his career at Brierley Hill Alliance.

New Holland (Nova Hollandia) was a colony established by Dutch naval captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz upon seizing the capital of Acadia, Fort Pentagouet in Penobscot Bay (present day Castine, Maine), and several other Acadian villages during the Franco-Dutch War.   The Dutch imprisoned the Governor of Acadia Jacques de Chambly.  The French and native allies under the command of St. Castin regained control of the area the following year in 1675, however, a year later the Dutch West India Company appointed Cornelis van Steenwijck, a Dutch merchant in New York, governor of the "coasts and countries of Nova Scotia and Acadie."Francis Champernowne: The Dutch Conquest of Acadie and Other Historical Papers, edited by Charles W. Tuttle and Albert H. Hoyt. ISBN 0-7884-1695-2. The formal Dutch claim to Acadia (1676) was finally abandoned at the end of the war with the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678.

[[Apartment House 1776]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by John Cage, 1976 in the United States

Apartment House 1776 is a 1976 composition by the American composer John Cage, composed for the United States Bicentennial and premiered by six orchestras across the country in 1976. The work was commissioned jointly by the orchestras of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia. In these performances, the work was performed together with Cage's 1975-76 orchestral work Renga.
Following Cage's Musicircus principle (featuring what he called a "multiplicity of centers"), the work calls for four solo vocalists, each representing a different religious tradition in the United States: Protestant, Sephardic, Native American, and African American. The singers, who represent the four religious traditions practiced at the U.S.'s founding in 1776, select authentic songs from their respective traditions and sing them without attempting to match them to those of the other singers.
The soloists for the original performances were Helen Schneyer (Protestant), Nico Castel (Sephardic), Swift Eagle (Native American – Apache and Santo Domingo Pueblo), and Jeanne Lee (African American). The original performances were conducted by Seiji Ozawa (Boston), Pierre Boulez (New York) and Zubin Mehta (Los Angeles) .
The singers are accompanied by versions of anthems and congregational music written by composers who were at least 20 years old at the time of the American Revolution, which Cage recomposed by means of chance operations. The composers whose works are so used include William Billings, James Lyon, Jacob French, Andrew Law, and Supply Belcher. In addition, Cage provides four marches for solo drums (transcribed by James Barnes from Benjamin Clark's Drum Book of 1797) and 14 tunes for melody instruments, which are based on dance or military tunes of the period.

The Korean influence on Japanese culture refers to the cultural influence of Korea upon Japanese culture.  As Korean Peninsula was the cultural bridge between Japan and the Asian continent through much of history, it is inevitable and well-documented that at various times this influence would be felt in various aspects of Japanese culture.  This influence was reflected most notably in the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from India via the Korean Kingdom of Baekje. Influence from Korea can also be seen in Japanese painting and architecture, ranging from the design of Buddhist temples to various smaller objects such as statues, textiles and ceramics.Jon Carter Covell, 1986

The burying mantis (Sphodropoda tristis) is a species of mantid native to Australia. They are white or brown and can reach lengths of up to some 40mm long, with distinct markings on the thorax and with a white blotch on the wings. They're called burying mantids because females dig holes in the ground, in which they lay their eggs and then refill the holes.
Burying mantids are not aggressive, (unlike the large brown mantis); the female does not try to attack the male whilst mating but will kill and eat the male afterwards. The burying mantis can be found in abundance on the Southeast coast of Queensland.

CATEGORIES: Non-profit organizations based in the United States

My Hero is a U.S. based nonprofit organization that promotes the use of new media and technology to "celebrate the best of humanity and empowers young people to realize their own potential to effect positive change in the world". The My Hero Project is a freely available digital media library and set of online resources to help people make and share hero-themed essays, images, web pages, audio clips and films with a global audience.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
The Teacher’s Room provides tools for educators to utilize in bringing the study of heroes into the classroom. The project both complements existing curricula and provides independent instruction to encourage, train and equip students around the world to creatively express their visions of heroes. Through guided activities, participants develop strong video, media production and digital story telling skills. MY HERO curricula advance communication skills and critical thinking. Participants can also choose to join the International Education and Resource Network (iEARN), a network of connected classrooms that enables prompted collaboration between classes.
The My Hero Project regularly offers educational media workshops in the U.S. and other countries to help teachers, students and adults gain necessary technological skills to not only share their hero stories but also to effectively compete in a challenging job market. A Cultural Arts Exchange Grant from the U.S. State Department funded the Global Exchange Project, in which MY HERO media arts educators traveled to the Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Senegal and Jordan to conduct media and video workshops. Through these workshops and the digital media library, My Hero Project uses artistic expression to bridge religious, political and language barriers and promotes greater cultural awareness.
The MY HERO International Film Festival, held annually, showcases films submitted by children and adults worldwide and recognizes commercial media that calls attention to real life heroes. Two major awards are presented at the festival: the MY HERO Media award to honor an exceptional activist and the Ron Kovic Peace Prize to honor the film that best exemplifies the theme of peace. 
The annual MY HERO Local Film Festival highlights the best local submissions and celebrates heroes in the organization’s home-town of Laguna Beach, California.
Traffic to the MY HERO website currently averages over 700,000 visits per month, accessing over 2 million pages of content. Thirty-seven classrooms participated in the iEARN learning circle last semester (Spring 2010). In 2009, the My Hero Project website received 429,713,027 hits from 5,688,348 visitors in 194 countries. The Teacher’s Room has over 51,645 participants annually.
HISTORY
The My Hero Project was founded in 1995 by a group of concerned parents to offset the lack of positive role models in the media. They decided to call attention to uplifting stories about people who make a positive difference in the world. Television producer Jeanne Meyers, philanthropist Karen Pritzker and documentary film producer Rita Stern established the MY HERO Project website and began gathering stories about heroes from around the world. 
Over the last 25 years, My Hero has partnered with iEARN.org, The Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum, Tech-Ed, The National Educational Computing Conference, The American Film Institute Silver Doc’s Workshops, KOCE-OC, Art Miles Mural Project and other internationally recognized nonprofit educational organizations.

Bunzl plc is a multinational distribution and outsourcing company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The company is primarily a distributor of a diverse range of non-food consumable products including food packaging, cleaning and hygiene supplies, personal protective equipment and carrier bags. Its customers include contract cleaners, retailers, catering firms and food processors. Bunzl has operations in 23 countries: almost half of its business is conducted in North America, with major operations in Europe as well as a smaller presence in Australasia and Brazil.
The activities of the company have changed a number of times during its existence, frequently incorporating the disparate business interests of the founding Bunzl family, which trace their history back to a haberdashery opened in Pozsony in 1854. The current company was established in London in 1940 as a manufacturer of cigarette filters, crêpe and tissue paper, and the production of fibres, pulp, paper, building materials and plastics were all brought into the firm - and subsequently sold - over the following decades. Bunzl restructured itself as a company purely focused on distribution through a divestment process which began in the early 1990s and ended with the 2005 spin out of Filtrona.
Bunzl has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 1957 and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

[[Chapelgorris]]

CATEGORIES: First Carlist War, Military units and formations of Spain, Military history of Spain

Chapelgorris (Basque language: txapelgorri, "red cap", also called "Peseteros") were a type of volunteer unit during the First Carlist War, raised at the beginning of the war in the province of Guipúzcoa.  They fought against the Carlists. 
A soldier of the British Legion called them a "half-wild soldiery" who "possess the same knowledge of the country, with the war-like habits and activity of the Carlists themselves, by whom they are held in considerable dread."Charles William Thompson, Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment (Oxford University, 1836), 10.
The Chapelgorris were formed in battalions of 700-800 men, and were officered mainly by Basques.  At first irregular troops, they were later considered a regular corps.  
They were called officially Free Forces (tropas francas) –for example, la Tropa franca de caballería de Ausejo (Free Forces of Cavalry of Ausejo) - but were disparagingly called Peseteros (which can be roughly translated as "money whores") by the Carlists,For example, see Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint-Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 264. since they received one peseta per day, though this payment was not standard and varied in nature from province to province.  When Baldomero Espartero received command of the Isabeline forces, he incorporated the Chapelgorris into his own troops; it is at that time that they received their red shakos.      
They wore a long gray capote or cloak; a red cap or beret; a small canvas bag.  For weapons they used a bandolier; a bayonet; and a carbine.Charles William Thompson, Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment (Oxford University, 1836), 11.  While in full dress, they wore a high cylindrical red shako, as well as blue jackets embroidered with yellow lace and studded with silver bells and ornaments.Charles William Thompson, Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment (Oxford University, 1836), 12.  However, after they became associated and attached with the British Legion, they adopted British uniforms, including the red coats of the British soldier.  They are sometimes incorrectly called Carlist troops due to their red caps; however, the only Carlist troops who had permission to wear this was the battalion known as Guías de Navarra (Navarre Guides), an honor granted to them by Zumalacárregui.  
An unflattering description of them states that: 
A vivid description of a fight between a Carlist and a Chapelgorri survives: "They wrestled for a few moments, but the Chapelgorri was strongest and stabbed the Carlist, at the same time seizing the side of his face in his teeth, and tearing it like a wolf: even when he had torn one mouthful, and the Carlist still writhing, he bit again and shook the head of the vanquished foe till his own face was besmeared with blood.”Alexander Somerville, History of the British legion, and war in Spain (London: James Pattie, 1839), 459.
They participated in the First Battle of Arquijas (1834).
Chapelgorris and British troops captured by the Carlists were often tortured or immediately executed.Charles William Thompson, Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment (Oxford University, 1836), 129.  In contrast, some Liberal troops of the line were saved by virtue of the Eliot treaty, which called for the exchange of prisoners rather than their immediate execution.

Licínio Pereira da Silva was arrested by the PIDE and accused of supporting desertions in the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He was tried by a special court armed with security measures, which was usually reserved for prisoners who were considered to be a major threat to the Salazar regime. Pereira da Silva was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison in 1973. However, Pereira da Silva was released from prison in Peniche on April 25, 1974, following the beginning of the Carnation Revolution. He was the last political prisoner of the PIDE.
Licínio Pereira da Silva died of a nosocomial infection at the age of 63 on April 1, 2008, while hospitalized at the Hospital Garcia de Orta in Almada, Portugal. His funeral, with a cremation, was held at the Cemitério dos Olivais in Lisbon on April 4, 2008.
