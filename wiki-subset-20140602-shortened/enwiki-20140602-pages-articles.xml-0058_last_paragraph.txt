Sweet Smell of Success is an American film noir/drama film from 1957 made by Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Productions and released by United Artists. It was directed by Alexander Mackendrick and stars Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison and Martin Milner. The screenplay was written by Clifford Odets, Ernest Lehman and Mackendrick from the novelette by Lehman. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes.
The film tells the story of powerful newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker (portrayed by Lancaster and clearly based on Walter Winchell) who uses his connections to ruin his sister's relationship with a man he deems inappropriate.
Despite a poorly received preview screening, Sweet Smell of Success has greatly improved in stature over the years. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."
Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical was created by Marvin Hamlisch, Craig Carnelia and John Guare in 2002. The next year, the AFI named J.J. Hunsecker number 35 of the top 50 movie villains of all time.

Tabu ([tpl]IPA-to|ˈtapu|pron[/tpl]; also called Tabu, a Story of the South Seas) is a 1931 film directed by F.W. Murnau, a docufiction.  The film is split into two chapters, the first called "Paradise" depicts the lives of two lovers on a South Seas island until they are forced to escape the island when the girl is chosen as a holy maid to the gods. The second chapter, "Paradise Lost", depicts the couple's life on a colonised island and how they adapt to and are exploited by Western civilisation. The title of the film comes from the Polynesian concept of tapu (spelled tabu in Tongan before 1943), from which is derived the English word "taboo."
The film's story was written by Robert J. Flaherty and F.W. Murnau; with the exception of the opening scene, the film was directed solely by Murnau. This was his last film; he died in hospital after an automobile accident on 11 March 1931, a week before the film's premiere in New York.
Cinematographer Floyd Crosby won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on this film. In 1994, Tabu was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

The character is best known from the fictional memoir Tevye and his Daughters (also called Tevye's Daughters, Tevye the Milkman or Tevye the Dairyman), about a pious Jewish milkman in Tsarist Russia, and the troubles he has with his six daughters:[tpl]Efn | In the first short story, there is also a mention of a seventh daughter; in Fiddler, however, there are only five daughters (using the first five names listed above), of whom only the first three have major roles.[/tpl]  Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze, Bielke, and Teibel.

The Village of Boyberik, where the stories are set, is based on the town of Boyarka in Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire).[tpl]Efn | In Fiddler, the town name is Anatevka.[/tpl]
The story was adapted for stage and film several times, including several Yiddish-language musicals. Most famously, it was adapted as the Broadway musical and later film versions of Fiddler on the Roof.

The Thief of Bagdad is a 1924 American swashbuckler film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Douglas Fairbanks. Freely adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, it tells the story of a thief who falls in love with the daughter of the Caliph of Bagdad. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Fairbanks considered this to be his personal favorite of all of his films, according to his son.  The film's use of imaginative gymnastics suited the athletic star, whose "catlike, seemingly effortless" movements were as much dance as gymnastics.Whitford 2007, p. 160. Along with his earlier Robin Hood (1922), the film marked Fairbanks's transformation from genial comedy to a career in "swashbuckling" roles. The movie, strong on special effects of the period (flying carpet, magic rope and fearsome monsters) and featuring massive Arabian-style sets, also proved to be a stepping stone for Anna May Wong, who portrayed a treacherous Mongol slave.

"Yumi, Yumi, Yumi", the Vanuatu national anthem, is in Bislama. 
More than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin; the remainder combines a few dozen words from French, as well as some vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu, essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology.See Charpentier (1979). While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. Bislama can be basically described as a language with an English vocabulary and an Oceanic grammar.See Camden (1979).

[[Participatory economics]]

Participatory economics, often abbreviated parecon, is an economic system based on participatory decision making as the primary economic mechanism for the allocation of the factors of production and guidance of production in a given society. Participatory decision-making involves the participation of all persons in decision-making on issues in proportion to the impact such decisions have on their lives. Participatory economics is a form of decentralized economic planning and socialism involving the common ownership of the means of production. The participatory economic system is proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalism, as well as an alternative to central planning. This economic model is primarily associated with the proposals put forth by the political theorist Michael Albert and economist Robin Hahnel, who describe participatory economics as an anarchistic economic vision.Albert, Michael Parecon: Life After Capitalism Chapter 19 Individuals / Society
The underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management and efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets). The institutions of parecon include workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for making decisions, balanced job complexes, remuneration based on individual effort, and participatory planning.
Albert and Hahnel stress that parecon is only meant to address an alternative economic theory and must be accompanied by equally important alternative visions in the fields of politics, culture and kinship. The authors have also discussed elements of anarchism in the field of politics, polyculturalism in the field of culture, and feminism in the field of family and gender relations as being possible foundations for future alternative visions in these other spheres of society. Stephen R. Shalom has begun work on a participatory political vision he calls "par polity". Both systems together make up the political philosophy of Participism. Participatory Economics has also significantly shaped the interim International Organization for a Participatory Society.

He coined the term cherology, the equivalent of phonology for sign language. However, sign language linguists, of which he may have been the first, now generally use the term "phonology" for signed languages.
Stokoe graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY in 1941, from where in 1946 he earned his Ph.D. in English, specifically medieval literature.[tpl]cite book |title= Talking Hands|first=Margalit|last=Fox|publisher=Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|year=2007 |isbn= 0743247132 |pages=92[/tpl] From there, he became an instructor of English at Wells College in Aurora, NY.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/stokoe.html |title=William C.

Though the relationship between Stokoe and Gallaudet was not always one of complete support (Gallaudet closed his Linguistics Research Laboratory, wherein he carried out the studies that would lead him to declare ASL a fully formed and legitimate language, in 1984, after he retired), the university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988.[tpl]cite book |title= Talking Hands|first=Margalit|last=Fox|publisher=Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|year=2007 |isbn= 0743247132 |pages=109–110[/tpl]http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/stokoe.html
Through the publication of his work, he was instrumental in changing the perception of ASL from that of a broken or simplified version of English to that of a complex and thriving natural language in its own right with an independent syntax and grammar as functional and powerful as any found in the oral languages of the world.Gannon, Jack. 1981.

Hutterites ([tpl]lang-de|Hutterer[/tpl]) are a communal branch of Anabaptists who, like the Amish and Mennonites, trace their roots to the Radical Reformation of the 16th century. Since the death of their namesake Jakob Hutter in 1536, the beliefs of the Hutterites, especially living in a community of goods and absolute pacifism, have resulted in hundreds of years of diaspora in many countries. Nearly extinct by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Hutterites found a new home in North America. Over 125 years their population grew from 400 to around 42,000. Today, most Hutterites live in Western Canada and the upper Great Plains of the U.S.

A transverse wave is a moving  wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular (or right angled) to the direction of energy transfer. If a transverse wave is moving in the positive x-direction, its  oscillations are in up and down directions that lie in the y–z plane. Light is an example of a transverse wave. For transverse waves in matter the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string are easily visualized as transverse waves.

[tpl]Unicode|Ç, ç[/tpl] (c-cedilla) is a Latin script letter, used in the Albanian, Azerbaijani, Ligurian, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Kurdish and Zazaki alphabets. This letter also appears in Catalan, French, Friulian, Occitan and Portuguese as a variant of the letter "c". It is also occasionally used in Crimean Tatar, and Manx.
It was first used for the sound of the voiceless alveolar affricate [tpl]IPA|/t͡s/[/tpl] in old Spanish and stems from the Visigothic form of the letter "z". This phoneme originated in Vulgar Latin from the palatalization of the plosives [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] in some conditions. Later, [tpl]IPA|/t͡s/[/tpl] changed into [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] in many Romance languages and dialects. Spanish has not used this symbol since an orthographic reform in the 18th century (which replaced "ç" with the now-devoiced "z"), but it was adopted for writing other languages.
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, "[tpl]IPA|ç[/tpl]" represents the voiceless palatal fricative.

[[Maximum power transfer theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Circuit theorems, Electrical engineering

In electrical engineering, the maximum power transfer theorem states that, to obtain maximum external power from a source with a finite internal resistance, the resistance of the load must equal the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals. Moritz von Jacobi published the maximum power (transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as "Jacobi's law".[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dKVbT-ZmdDwC&pg=PA406 |title=Dynamo-Electric Machinery; A Manual for Students of Electrotechnics |author=Thompson Phillips |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |isbn=978-1-110-35104-6 |date=2009-05-30[/tpl]
The theorem results in maximum power transfer, and not maximum efficiency. If the resistance of the load is made larger than the resistance of the source, then efficiency is higher, since a higher percentage of the source power is transferred to the load, but the magnitude of the load power is lower since the total circuit resistance goes up.
If the load resistance is smaller than the source resistance, then most of the power ends up being dissipated in the source, and although the total power dissipated is higher, due to a lower total resistance, it turns out that the amount dissipated in the load is reduced.
The theorem states how to choose (so as to maximize power transfer) the load resistance, once the source resistance is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario.  It does not say how to choose the source resistance for a given load resistance. In fact, the source resistance that maximizes power transfer is always zero, regardless of the value of the load resistance.
The theorem can be extended to AC circuits that include reactance, and states that maximum power transfer occurs when the load impedance is equal to the complex conjugate of the source impedance.

CATEGORIES: Pendulums

A Kater's pendulum is a reversible freeswinging pendulum invented by British physicist and army captain Henry Kater in 1817[ref]
</ref> for use as a [[gravimeter]] instrument to measure the local [[acceleration of gravity]].  Its advantage is that, unlike previous pendulum gravimeters, the pendulum's [[centre of gravity]] and [[center of oscillation]] don't have to be determined, allowing greater accuracy.  For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater's pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth's gravity during [[Geodetics|geodetic]] surveys.  It is now used only for demonstrating pendulum principles.

It amended the Maastricht Treaty (or the Treaty on European Union) and the Treaty of Rome (or the Treaty establishing the European Community which, before the Maastricht Treaty, was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community). The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time.
The entrance into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.

Gascony ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|s|k|ə|n|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Gascogne[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-fr|ɡaskɔɲ|[/tpl]; Gascon: Gasconha [tpl]IPA-oc|ɡasˈkuɲɔ|[/tpl]) is an area of southwest France that was part of the "Province of Guyenne and Gascony" prior to the French Revolution. The region is vaguely defined and the distinction between Guyenne and Gascony is unclear; sometimes they are considered to overlap, and sometimes Gascony is considered a part of Guyenne. Most definitions put Gascony east and south of Bordeaux.
It is currently divided between the region of Aquitaine (departments of Landes, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, southwestern Gironde, and southern Lot-et-Garonne) and the region of Midi-Pyrénées (departments of Gers, Hautes-Pyrénées, southwestern Tarn-et-Garonne, and western Haute-Garonne). 
Gascony was historically inhabited by Basque-related people who appear to have spoken a language similar to Basque. The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque (see Wasconia below). From medieval times until the nineteenth century, the Gascon language was spoken, which is a regional variant of the Occitan Language. It is also the land of d'Artagnan, who inspired Alexandre Dumas's character d'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers. It is also home to the hero of the play Cyrano de Bergerac (though this character has little in common with the real Cyrano de Bergerac, who was a Parisian) and to Henry III of Navarre who later became king of France as Henry IV.
Gascony is also famed for its douceur de vivre ("sweetness of life"), its food (it is home to foie gras and Armagnac brandy), its medieval towns and villages locally called bastides nested amidst green rolling hills, its sunny weather, the beauty of its landscape, with the occasional distant views of the Pyrenees mountain range, all contribute to the popularity of Gascony as a tourist destination.

Batasuna ([tpl]lang-en|Unity[/tpl], originally Herri Batasuna or "Unity of the People") was a Basque nationalist political party based mainly in Spain, where it was outlawed in 2003, after a very contested court ruling declared proven that the party was financing ETA with public money.
The party is included in the "European Union list of terrorist persons and organizations" as a component of ETA.[ref][tpl]PDFlink|EU list of terrorist organizations|43.6 KB[/tpl], 29 May 2006
As an association and not as a political party, Batasuna had a minor presence in the French Basque country, where it remained legal as "Batasuna" until its self-dissolution in January 2013.http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2013/01/03/actualidad/1357224725_721621.html
Batasuna's ranks and support base have been represented under different names since it was first declared legal in the late 1970s with the Spanish Transition to democracy. Thus, Batasuna's predecessors were the original Herri Batasuna and, then, Euskal Herritarrok. After having been outlawed in 2003, Batasuna's core support revamped yet again by co-opting the thus far marginal parties EHAK and Acción Nacionalista Vasca (ANV).
Batasuna was a part of the Basque National Liberation Movement which includes social organizations, trade unions, youth (Jarrai and Gazteriak, now merged in Haika and Segi), and women's groups (Egizan). Jarrai-Haika-Segi, Gestoras pro-Amnistia, Askatasuna and other groups closely related to Batasuna were also declared illegal by different court rulings on the same charges of having collaborated with or being part of ETA.

In a more restricted sense, the Indies can be used to refer to the islands of South East Asia, especially the Malay Archipelago.Oxford Dictionary of English 2e, Oxford University Press, 2003, "East Indies/East India"Britannica.com "East Indies" The name "Indies" is derived from the river Indus and is used to connote parts of Asia that came under Indian cultural influence (except Vietnam which came under Chinese cultural influence).
Dutch-held colonies in the area were known as the Dutch East Indies before Indonesian independence, while Spanish-held colonies were known as the Spanish East Indies before the Philippines' independence. The East Indies may also include Indochina, the Philippine Islands, Brunei, Singapore and East Timor. It does not, however, include western New Guinea (West Papua), which is part of Melanesia. 
The inhabitants of the East Indies are sometimes called East Indians, distinguishing them both from inhabitants of the Caribbean (which is also called the West Indies) and from the indigenous peoples of the Americas who are often called "American Indians."  However, the peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam are the most popular religions throughout the region, while Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of language families, and should not be confused with the term Indic, which refers only to a group of Indo-Iranian languages from South Asia. 
The extensive East Indies are subdivided into two sections (from a European perspective), archaically called Hither India and Further India. The first is the former British India, the second is modern Southeast Asia or the ASEAN Bloc. 
Regions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, British East Indies refers to Malaysia, the Dutch East Indies means Indonesia, and Spanish East Indies means the Philippines.
Historically, the king of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) was identified with "Prester John of the Indies", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of "Three Indias".

The IBM 704, the first mass-produced computer with floating point arithmetic hardware, was introduced by IBM in 1954.IBM Archives: 704 Data Processing System Product Profile The IBM 704 Manual of operation states:IBM Type 704 Manual of operation, Form 24-66661-1, IBM, 1956, http://www.cs.virginia.edu/brochure/images/manuals/IBM_704/IBM_704.html IBM 704 Manual of Operation
 
 The type 704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine is a large-scale, high-speed  electronic calculator controlled by an internally stored program of the single address type.

The 704 was a significant improvement over the earlier IBM 701 in terms of architecture and implementation. Like the 701, the 704 used vacuum tube logic circuitry.  Changes from the 701 included the use of core memory instead of Williams tubes and the addition of three index registers. To support these new features, the instructions were expanded to use the full 36-bit word. The new instruction set, which was not compatible with the 701, became the base for the "scientific architecture" subclass of the IBM 700/7000 series computers.
The 704 could execute up to 12,000 floating-point additions per second. IBM sold 140 type 704 systems between 1955 and 1960.was 123; edit comment suggests Amdahl, IEEE Computer, volume ?, issue?, date?, p 40.

The Solway Firth ([tpl]lang-gd|Tràchd Romhra[/tpl]) is a firth that forms part of the border between England and Scotland, between Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) and Dumfries and Galloway. It stretches from St Bees Head, just south of Whitehaven in Cumbria, to the Mull of Galloway, on the western end of Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.
The coastline is characterised by lowland hills and small mountains. It is a mainly rural area with fishing and hill farming (as well as some arable farming) still playing a large part in the local economy, although tourism is increasing. It has also been used for the location of films such as The Wicker Man (starring Edward Woodward), which was filmed around Kirkcudbright.

The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with 2.7 million youth members and over 1 million adult volunteers.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/Marketing/Resources/ReporttotheNation.aspx |title=2011 Report to the Nation |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=March 10, 2012[/tpl] Since its founding in 1910 as part of the international Scout Movement, more than 110 million Americans have been members of the BSA.[tpl]r|townley[/tpl]
The BSA's goal is to train youth in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the Scout method is part of the program to inculcate typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking.[tpl]r|ussspvision|ussspaims[/tpl] The BSA has several locations in Florida, Minnesota, New Mexico, and West Virginia in the United States and Manitoba and Ontario in Canada that allow Scouts to participate in the various aforementioned outdoor activities which are collectively called high-adventure bases.
The BSA is a constituent member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. The traditional Scouting divisions are Cub Scouting for boys ages 7 to 10½ years, Boy Scouting for boys ages 10½ to 18 and Venturing for young men and women ages 14 (or 13 and having completed the 8th grade) through 21. Learning for Life is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education.[tpl]r|bsamembers|grolier[/tpl] The BSA operates traditional Scouting by chartering local organizations, such as churches, clubs, civic associations, or educational organization, to implement the scouting program for youth within their communities. Units are led entirely by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization, who are supported by local councils using both paid Professional Scouters and volunteers.
The influence of Scouting on American society is frequently cited by both its advocates and critics. Critics have called the BSA's membership obligations unfair, resulting in litigation in various state and federal courts.

Sherry Turkle is the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She obtained a BA in Social Studies and later a Ph.D. in Sociology and Personality Psychology at Harvard University. She now focuses her research on psychoanalysis and human-technology interaction. She has written several books focusing on the psychology of human relationships with technology, especially in the realm of how people relate to computational objects.
In The Second Self, originally published in 1984, Turkle writes about how computers are not tools as much as they are a part of our social and psychological lives. “‘Technology,’ she writes, ‘catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think.’”http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10515 She goes on using Jean Piaget's psychology discourse to discuss how children learn about computers and how this affects their minds. The Second Self was received well by critics and was praised for being “a very thorough and ambitious study.”http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&id=3240
In Life on the Screen, Turkle discusses how emerging technology, specifically computers, affect the way we think and see ourselves as humans.  She presents to us the different ways in which computers affect us, and how it has led us to the now prevalent use of "cyberspace."  Turkle suggests that assuming different personal identities in a MUD (i.e. computer fantasy game) may be therapeutic. She also considers the problems that arise when using MUDs. Turkle discusses what she calls women's "non-linear" approach to the technology, calling it "soft mastery" and "bricolage" (as opposed to the "hard mastery" of linear, abstract thinking and computer programming). She discusses problems that arise when children pose as adults online.°
Turkle also explores the psychological and societal impact of such "relational artifacts" as social robots, and how these and other technologies are changing attitudes about human life and living things generally. One result may be a devaluation of authentic experience in a relationship.
Together with Seymour Papert she wrote the influential paper "Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete." 
Professor Turkle has written numerous articles on psychoanalysis and culture and on the "subjective side" of people's relationships with technology, especially computers. She is engaged in active study of robots, digital pets, and simulated creatures, particularly those designed for children and the elderly as well as in a study of mobile cellular technologies. Profiles of Professor Turkle have appeared in such publications as The New York Times, Scientific American, and Wired Magazine. She is a featured media commentator on the effects of technology for CNN, NBC, ABC, and NPR, including appearances on such programs as Nightline and 20/20.
Turkle has begun to assess the adverse effects of rapidly advancing technology on human social behavior. Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other was published in 2011 and when discussing the topic she speaks about the need to limit the use of popular technological devices because of these adverse effects.Sherry Turkle on Being Alone Together, Moyers & Company, October 18, 2013

[[Order of the Arrow]]

CATEGORIES: Order of the Arrow, Fraternal service organizations, Honor societies, Youth-led organizations

The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the national honor society of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). It uses American Indian-styled traditions and ceremonies to bestow recognition on scouts selected by their peers as best exemplifying the ideals of Scouting. The society was created by E. Urner Goodman, with the assistance of Carroll A. Edson, in 1915 as a means of reinforcing the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. The goal was to establish these as lifelong guidelines, and to encourage continued participation in Scouting and camping. Influenced in part by camp traditions, and Indian folklore, the OA uses "safeguarded" symbols, handshakes, and ceremonies to impart a sense of community. 
Inducted members, known as Arrowmen or Brothers, are organized into local youth-led lodges that harbor fellowship, promote camping, and render service to Boy Scout councils and their communities. Members wear identifying insignia on their uniforms, most notably the OA pocket flap (representing their individual lodge) and the OA sash (worn at official OA functions) and are eligible for special OA awards. The OA program sponsors several events, awards, and training functions.

[[Multistage sampling]]
CATEGORIES: Sampling techniques, Market research

Multistage sampling is a complex form of cluster sampling. Cluster sampling is a type of sampling which involves dividing the population into groups (or clusters). Then, one or more clusters are chosen at random and everyone within the chosen cluster is sampled. 
Using all the sample elements in all the selected clusters may be prohibitively expensive or unnecessary. Under these circumstances, multistage cluster sampling becomes useful. Instead of using all the elements contained in the selected clusters, the researcher randomly selects elements from each cluster. Constructing the clusters is the first stage. Deciding what elements within the cluster to use is the second stage. The technique is used frequently when a complete list of all members of the population does not exist and is inappropriate.
In some cases, several levels of cluster selection may be applied before the final sample elements are reached. For example, household surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics begin by dividing metropolitan regions into 'collection districts' and selecting some of these collection districts (first stage). The selected collection districts are then divided into blocks, and blocks are chosen from within each selected collection district (second stage). Next, dwellings are listed within each selected block, and some of these dwellings are selected (third stage). This method makes it unnecessary to create a list of every dwelling in the region and necessary only for selected blocks. In remote areas, an additional stage of clustering is used, in order to reduce travel requirements.http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/25EBCE8C88824592CA25710E007321C3?opendocument
Although cluster sampling and stratified sampling bear some superficial similarities, they are substantially different. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from all the strata, where in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are studied, either in single- or multi-stage.

Roscoe Conkling "Fatty" Arbuckle (March 24, 1887 – June 29, 1933) was an American silent film actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter. Starting at the Selig Polyscope Company he eventually moved to Keystone Studios where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd. He mentored Charlie Chaplin and discovered Buster Keaton and Bob Hope. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s, and soon became one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1921 with Paramount Pictures for US$1 million.[tpl]cite news | first=Denise| last= Noe| url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/2.html |title = Fatty Arbuckle and the Death of Virginia Rappe |publisher= Crime Library at truTV|accessdate = 2008-07-03[/tpl]
Between November 1921 and April 1922, Arbuckle endured three widely publicized trials for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. Rappe had fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco in September 1921; she died four days later. Arbuckle was accused by Rappe's acquaintance of raping and accidentally killing Rappe. After the first two trials, which resulted in hung juries, Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written apology from the jury.
Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. Following the trials, his films were banned and he was publicly ostracized. Although the ban on his films was lifted within a year, Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. He later worked as a film director under the alias William Goodrich. He was finally able to return to acting, making short two-reel comedies in 1932 for Warner Brothers. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1933 at age 46, reportedly on the same day he signed a contract with Warner Brothers to make a feature film.

Murdo Mackenzie (April 24, 1850 – May 30, 1939) was twice (1891–1901 and 1922–1937) manager of the Scots-owned Matador Land and Cattle Company, and founding president of the American Stock Growers Association, for whom he testified before congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission. His testimony led to passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906 which eased railroad fares for western shippers.
President Teddy Roosevelt appointed him to the National Conservation Commission in 1908, and it was Mackenzie, then manager of the Brazil Land, Cattle and Packing Company, with whom Roosevelt stayed when he visited Brazil in 1913.
Born in  near Tain, Ross-shire, Scotland, where he attended parish school and graduated from the Tain Royal Academy in 1869. He served in a law office and in the British Linen Bank, then as factor for Sir Charles Ross's estate at Balnagown Castle. He married Isabella Stronach MacBain in 1876 and fathered five children with her.  Among these was his son, David G. (Dode) MacKenzie, who, in December 1909, was shot (possibly murdered) in La Beau, South Dakota, while also working for Matador. 
He sailed to the United States in 1885 to accept an offer to manage the Prairie Land and Cattle Company in Trinidad, Colorado. After becoming a naturalized citizen, he was elected mayor of Trinidad in 1891, before accepting the directorship at Matador.
He died, aged 89, in 1939 in Denver, Colorado, where he is buried.
The town of Murdo, South Dakota was named for Mackenzie.[tpl]cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=REtEXQNWq6MC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA993#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Historical Gazetteer of the United States | publisher=Routledge | date=May 13, 2013 | accessdate=30 November 2013 | author=Hellmann, Paul T. | pages=993[/tpl]

Following the nationalist example of Bedřich Smetana, Dvořák frequently employed features of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia (then parts of the Austrian Empire and now constituting the Czech Republic). Dvořák's own style has been described as 'the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them'.Clapham (1995), 765
Born in Nelahozeves, Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age. His first surviving work, Forget-Me-Not Polka in C (Polka pomněnka) was written possibly as early as 1855.Burghauser 1966, pp. 49-50. He graduated from the organ school in Prague in 1859.Burghauser 1996, p. 501. In the 1860s, he played as a violist in the Bohemian Provisional Theater Orchestra and taught piano lessons. In 1873, he married Anna Čermáková, and left the orchestra to pursue another career as a church organist. He wrote several compositions during this period. Dvořák's music attracted the interest of Johannes Brahms, who assisted his career; he was also supported by the critics Eduard Hanslick and Louis Ehlert.
After the premiere of his cantata Stabat Mater (1880), Dvořák visited the United Kingdom and became popular there; his Seventh Symphony was written for London. After a brief conducting stint in Russia in 1890, Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory in 1891. In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City, where he also composed. However, shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness made him decide to return to Bohemia. From 1895 until his death, he composed mainly operatic and chamber music. At his death, he left several unfinished works.
Among Dvořák's best known works are his From The New World Symphony, the "American" String Quartet, the opera Rusalka and his Cello Concerto in B minor. Among his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song 'Songs my mother taught me' are also widely performed and recorded. He composed operas, choral music, a wide variety of chamber music, concerti and many other orchestral and vocal and instrumental pieces. He has been described as 'arguably the most versatile...composer of his time'.Taruskin (2010), 754

Charles Alfred Taliaferro (August 29, 1905 – February 3, 1969), known simply as Al Taliaferro, was a Disney comics artist who used to produce Disney comic strips for King Features Syndicate. Many of his strips were written by Bob Karp.
He is best known for his work on the Donald Duck comic strip, but he started his career lettering the Mickey Mouse strips (March 1931 – July 1932), and drew the Bucky Bug comics in 1932 as well as Silly Symphonies pages from 1932 to 1939. Taliaferro co-created a number of characters, including Huey, Dewey and Louie, Bolivar, Grandma Duck, and arguably Daisy Duck. He drew Donald Duck comic strips from 1938 until his death in 1969 in Glendale, California.
After his family moved to Glendale, Al studied art at the "Institute of Art" in California. On January 5, 1931 he was hired in Disney Studios as an animator, but soon transferred to the comic strip department. At its height the Donald Duck comic strips was published in 322 newspapers.
While many of Taliaferro's strips were reprinted in Disney comic books, in only a few instances did he do original artwork for comic books. Among these was the Cheerios Premium Giveaway Donald Duck: Counter Spy (1947) and the cover of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #107 (August 1949) http://www.comics.org/coverview.lasso?id=7759&zoom=2. Two Children's books with Disney characters he illustrated are Donald and His Cat Troubles(1948) and Donald Duck and the Hidden Gold (1951).
The Taliaferros trace their origins to Northern Italy and were one the early families who settled in Virginia in the 17th century. The family name, originally Tagliaferro, literally means Ironcutter in Italian.

[[Mermaid]]

CATEGORIES: Human-headed mythical creatures, Mermaids, Heraldic beasts, Lake cryptids, Medieval legends, Nereids, Sea cryptids, Water spirits

A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.
Mermaids are associated with the mythological Greek sirens as well as with sirenia, a biological order comprising dugongs and manatees. Some of the historical sightings by sailors may have been misunderstood encounters with these aquatic mammals. Christopher Columbus reported seeing mermaids while exploring the Caribbean, and sightings have been reported in the 20th and 21st centuries in Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe.  The U.S. National Ocean Service stated in 2012 that no evidence of mermaids has ever been found.
Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's well-known fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics.

Taylor, United States National Film Registry films, Universal Pictures films, Films_shot_in_San_Francisco,_California

Vertigo is a 1958 psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock. The story was based on the 1954 novel D'entre les morts by Boileau-Narcejac. The screenplay was written by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor.
The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John "Scottie" Ferguson. Scottie is forced into early retirement because an incident in the line of duty has caused him to develop acrophobia (an extreme fear of heights) and vertigo (a sensation of false, rotational movement). Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a private investigator to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who is behaving strangely.
The film was shot on location in San Francisco, California, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It popularized the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as "the Vertigo effect".
The film received mixed reviews upon initial release, but is now often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Attracting significant scholarly criticism, it replaced Citizen Kane as the best film of all time in the 2012 British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948|title=Vertigo is named 'greatest film of all time'|work=BBC News |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl] and has appeared repeatedly in best film polls by the American Film Institute,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/ |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 |work=American Film Institute |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl] as well as being named in 2008 as the 40th greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine in its issue of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[tpl]cite news |publisher=Empire Magazine |title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |date=January 1, 2014 |url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/35.asp |accessdate=January 1, 2014[/tpl] In 1996, Vertigo underwent a major restoration to create a new 70mm print and DTS soundtrack.

Cartoons.[tpl]bcdb|5289[/tpl] The Michael Maltese story features Elmer Fudd chasing Bugs Bunny through a parody of 19th-century classical composer Richard Wagner's operas, particularly Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), Der Fliegende Hollander, and Tannhäuser. It borrows heavily from the second opera in the "Ring Cycle" Die Walküre, woven around the standard Bugs-Elmer conflict.
Originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, What's Opera, Doc? features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. The short is also sometimes informally referred to as Kill the Wabbit after the line sung by Fudd to the tune of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries", the opening passage from Act Three of Die Walküre (which is also the leitmotif of the Valkyries).
In 1994, What's Opera, Doc? was voted #1 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by 1,000 members of the animation field.

John Ruskin (8 February 1819 – 20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, also an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects ranging from geology to architecture, myth to ornithology, literature to education, and botany to political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.
He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century, and up to the First World War. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.
Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of Modern Painters (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s he championed the Pre-Raphaelites who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. Unto This Last (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford, where he established the Ruskin School of Drawing. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title Fors Clavigera (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the Guild of St George, an organisation that endures today.

Clarabelle Cow is a Disney fictional character within the Mickey Mouse universe of characters. Clarabelle Cow was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks in 1928. Clarabelle is one of Minnie Mouse's best friends and is usually depicted as the girlfriend of Horace Horsecollar, although she has also been paired with Goofy occasionally. Clarabelle has never been anything more than a supporting character in the USA, her country of origin; only in Italy has she been treated as one of Disney's leading lights. Nevertheless, the character remains famous in the United States, surprisingly so in light of her decades of relative disuse.

Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.

The Fenian Brotherhood was an Irish republican-Irish American organisation founded in the United States in 1858 by John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny.Ryan, pg.92. The first organization was known as the Emmet Monument Association, founded in the early part of 1855 (ibid.53-4). The Fenian Brotherhood was launched soon after the founding of the Irish Republican Brotherhood in Dublin in 1858 (ibid. 92)Neeson, pg.17 It was a precursor to Clan na Gael, a sister organisation to the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Members were commonly known as "Fenians". O'Mahony, who was a Celtic scholar, named his organisation after the Fianna, the legendary band of Irish warriors led by Fionn mac Cumhaill.Buescher, John.

Charles VII (22 February 1403 – 22 July 1461), called the Victorious ([tpl]lang-fr|le Victorieux[/tpl])Wagner, John A., Encyclopedia of the Hundred Years War, (Greenwood Press:Westport, 2006), 89. or the Well-Served ([tpl]lang-fr|le Bien-Servi[/tpl]), was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 1422 to his death,[tpl]MLCC|warning=1 |title=France, Capetian Kings|date=August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] although his legitimacy was initially contested by Henry VI of England.
In 1422, Charles VII inherited the throne of France under desperate circumstances. Forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France, including Paris, the most populous city, and Reims, the city in which the French kings were traditionally crowned. In addition, his father Charles VI the Mad had disinherited him in 1420 and recognized Henry V of England and his heirs as the legitimate successors of the French crown instead. At the same time, a civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs (supporters of the House of Valois) and the Burgundian party.
With his court removed to Bourges, south of the Loire River, Charles was disparagingly called the “King of Bourges”. However his political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France. Joan of Arc and other charismatic military leaders led French troops to several important victories that paved the way for the coronation of Charles VII in 1429 at Reims Cathedral. This long-awaited event boosted French morale as hostilities with England resumed. By 1453, the French had expelled English from all their continental possessions, except for the Pale of Calais. 
The last years of Charles VII were marked by conflicts with his turbulent son, the future Louis XI of France.

[[Government of Colombia]]
CATEGORIES: Government of Colombia

The Government of Colombia  
is a republic with separation of powers into executive, judicial and legislative branches. 
Its legislature has a congress,
its judiciary has a supreme court, and
its executive branch has a president.
The citizens of Colombia cast votes concerning their government, and they employ a public sector office for an inspector general to oversee the public interface of the government.  This safeguards the public, and guarantee the human rights spelled out in the Constitution of 1991, which provides the framework for a welfare state and a unitary republic. 
Colombia has "control institutions" which mix government and public officials, who work alongside one another.  For example, the public's inspector general works closely with the government's controller general whose job it is to ensure governmental fiscal responsibility. An independent Ombudsman deals with maladministration complaints and functions as the national human rights institution.

Osborne House is a former royal residence in East Cowes, Isle of Wight, UK. The house was built between 1845 and 1851 for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as a summer home and rural retreat.
Prince Albert designed the house himself in the style of an Italian Renaissance palazzo. The builder was Thomas Cubitt, the London architect and builder whose company built the main façade of Buckingham Palace for the royal couple in 1847. An earlier smaller house on the site was demolished to make way for a new and far larger house.
Queen Victoria died at Osborne House in January 1901. Following her death, the house became surplus to royal requirements and was given to the state with a few rooms retained as a private royal museum dedicated to Queen Victoria. From 1903 until 1921 it was used as a junior officer training college for the Royal Navy known as the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Today it is fully open to the public.

Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736 – June 6, 1799) was an American attorney, planter and politician who became known as an orator during the movement for independence in Virginia in the 1770s. A Founding Father, he served as the first and sixth post-colonial Governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786.
Henry led the opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765 and is remembered for his "Give me liberty, or give me death!" speech.  Along with Samuel Adams and Thomas Paine, he is regarded as one of the most influential champions of Republicanism and an invested promoter of the American Revolution and its fight for independence.
After the Revolution, Henry was a leader of the anti-federalists in Virginia.  He opposed the United States Constitution, fearing that it endangered the rights of the States as well as the freedoms of individuals; he helped gain adoption of the Bill of Rights. By 1798 however, he supported President John Adams and the Federalists; he denounced passage of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions as he feared the social unrest and widespread executions that had followed the increasing radicalism of the French Revolution.
As a married man, Henry was an expanding landowner. By 1779, along with his cousin and her husband, Henry owned a [tpl]convert|10,000|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] plantation known by the name of Leatherwood. He is also recorded to have purchased up to 78 slaves. In 1794 he and his wife retired to Red Hill Plantation, which had [tpl]convert|520|acres|km2|adj=on[/tpl] in Charlotte County that was also a functioning tobacco plantation.

John Butler Yeats (16 March 1839 – 3 February 1922) was an Irish artist and the father of William Butler Yeats, Lily Yeats, Lollie Yeats and Jack B. Yeats. He is probably best known for his portrait of the young William Butler Yeats which is one of a number of his portraits of Irishmen and women in the Yeats museum in the National Gallery of Ireland. His portrait of John O'Leary (1904) is considered to be his masterpiece (Raymond Keaveney 2002).
Yeats was born in Lawrencetown, townland of Tullylish, County Down. His parents were William Butler Yeats (1806–1862) and Jane Grace Corbert, John Butler Yeats was the eldest of nine children.  Educated in Trinity College Dublin and a member of the University Philosophical Society John Butler Yeats began his career as a lawyer and devilled briefly with Isaac Butt before he took up painting in 1867 and studied at Heatherley's Art School. There are few records of his sales, so there is no catalogue of his work in private collections. It is possible that some of his early work may have been destroyed by fire in WWII. It is clear that he had no trouble getting commissions as his sketches and oils are found in private homes in Ireland, England and America. His later portraits show great sensitivity to the sitter. However, he was a poor businessman and was never financially secure. He moved house frequently and shifted several times between England and Ireland. At the age of 69 he moved to New York, where he was friendly with members of the Ashcan School of painters. He is buried in Chestertown Rural Cemetery in Chestertown, New York, next to his friend, Jeanne Robert Foster.

[[Character (arts)]]

CATEGORIES: Drama, Fiction, Fictional characters, Narratology

A character (or fictional character) is a person in a narrative work of arts (such as a novel, play, television series or film).Baldick (2001, 37) and Childs and Fowler (2006, 23). See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor". Derived from the ancient Greek word  kharaktêr, the English word dates from the Restoration,OED "character" sense 17.a citing, inter alia, Dryden's 1679 preface to Troilus and Cressida: "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in Œdipus..." although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones  in 1749.Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: [tpl]quotation|... is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, s.v.).[/tpl] From this, the sense of "a part played by an actor" developed.Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: [tpl]quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, Tom Jones).[/tpl]  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves "the illusion of being a human person."Pavis (1998, 47). In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.[tpl]cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30[/tpl] Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective impersonation  by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practised by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.
A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type.Baldick (2001, 265). Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised. The characters in Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler (1891) and August Strindberg's Miss Julie (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.Aston and Savona (1991, 35).
The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.Aston and Savona (1991, 41). The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic) that it forms with the other characters.Elam (2002, 133). The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order.Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).

[[American Dipper]]

The American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), also known as a Water Ouzel, is a stocky dark grey bird with a head sometimes tinged with brown, and white feathers on the eyelids that cause the eyes to flash white as the bird blinks. It is 16.5 cm long and weighs on average 46 g. It has long legs, and bobs its whole body up and down during pauses as it feeds on the bottom of fast-moving, rocky streams. It inhabits the mountainous regions of Central America and western North America from Panama to Alaska.
This species, like other dippers, is equipped with an extra  eyelid called a "nictitating membrane" that allows it to see underwater, and scales that close its nostrils when submerged.  Dippers also produce more oil than most birds, which may help keep them warmer when seeking food underwater.
In most of its habits, it closely resembles its European counterpart, the White-throated Dipper, Cinclus cinclus, which is also sometimes known as a Water Ouzel. It feeds on aquatic insects and their larvae, including dragonfly nymphs, small crayfish, and caddisfly larvae. It may also take tiny fish or tadpoles.
The song consists of high whistles or trills peee peee pijur pijur repeated a few times. Both sexes of this bird sing year round. It defends a linear territory along streams.  Its habit of diving and walking along the bottom of streams in search of food sometimes makes it the occasional prey of large salmon or other anadromous fish.
The American Dipper's nest is a globe-shaped structure with a side entrance, close to water, on a rock ledge, river bank, behind a waterfall or under a bridge. The normal clutch is 2-4 white eggs, incubated solely by the female, which hatch after about 15–17 days, with another 20–25 days to fledging. The male helps to feed the young.
It is usually a permanent resident, moving slightly south or to lower elevations if necessary to find food or unfrozen water. The presence of this indicator species shows good water quality; it has vanished from some locations due to pollution or increased silt load in streams.
There is at least one record of an American Dipper being eaten by a Dolly Varden Trout.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Wilson Bulletin |title=Dipper swallowed by trout |first1=Charles L. |last1=Elliott |first2=Steve |last2=Peck |url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Wilson/v092n04/p0524-p0524.pdf |volume=92 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=December 1980[/tpl]

Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|oʊ[/tpl]), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist.Bono-fire. He is best recognized as the frontman of the Dublin-based rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.
Outside the band, he has collaborated and recorded with numerous artists, is managing director and a managing partner of Elevation Partners,Billboard.biz. and has refurbished and owns The Clarence Hotel in Dublin with The Edge. Bono is also widely known for his activism concerning Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign and Product Red. He has organised and played in several benefit concerts and has met with influential politicians. Bono has been praised and criticised for his activism and involvement with U2.Mellgren, D. (24 February 2006). Bono Among Nobel Peace Prize Nominees. Associated Press. Retrieved 14 January 2007, from Bono Among Nobel Peace Prize Nominees. He was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and, with Bill and Melinda Gates, was named Time Person of the Year in 2005, among other awards and nominations. On 17 July 2013, the BBC announced that Bono had been made a Commandeur of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters).

Gottfried Wilhelm "Billy" Bitzer (April 21, 1874 - April 29, 1944) was a pioneering cinematographer notable for his close association with D. W. Griffith.
Bitzer provided assistance during Griffith's directorial debut, 1908's The Adventures of Dollie, which was shot by Arthur Marvin. He eventually succeeded Marvin as Griffith's regular cinematographer, working with him on some of his most important films and contributing significantly to cinematic innovations attributed to Griffith.
In 1910, he photographed Griffith's silent short, In Old California, in the Los Angeles village of "Hollywoodland", qualifying Bitzer as, arguably, Hollywood's first Director of Photography.
In 2003, a survey conducted by the International Cinematographers Guild named him one of the ten most influential cinematographers in history."Top 10 Most Influential Cinematographers Voted on by Camera Guild," October 16, 2003. Retrieved January 28, 2011. Bitzer, it is said, "developed camera techniques that set the standard for all future motion pictures."Encyclopædia Britannica, Micropædia, Vol. II, p51
Among Bitzer's innovations were
Prior to his career as a cameraman, Bitzer developed early cinematic technologies for the American Mutoscope Company, eventually to become the Biograph Company. He admired and learned the art of motion picture photography from Kinetoscope inventor W.K.L. Dickson, who directed the early Biograph shorts on which Bitzer cut his teeth. Until 1903, Bitzer was employed by Biograph primarily as a documentary photographer, and from 1903 onward primarily as the photographer of narrative films, as these gained popularity. [tpl]Harvard citation|Hendricks|1964|pp=5[/tpl]
In 1908 Bitzer entered into his first collaboration with Griffith. The two would work together for the rest of Bitzer's career, leaving Biograph in 1913 for the Mutual Film Corporation where Bitzer continued to innovate, perfecting existing technologies and inventing new ones. During this time he pioneered the field of matte photography and made use of innovative lighting techniques, closeups, and iris shots.
The apex of Bitzer and Griffith's collaboration came with The Birth of a Nation (1915), a film funded in part by Bitzer's life savings, and the epic Intolerance (1916).
For all his innovation, Bitzer did not survive the industry's transition to sound, and in 1944 he suffered a heart attack and died in Hollywood in relative obscurity.
His autobiography, Billy Bitzer: His Story, was published posthumously in 1973.

Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emmanuel;[tpl]sfn|London Gazette|7 February 1840[/tpl] later The Prince Consort; 26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861) was the husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
He was born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to a family connected to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20 he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria, with whom he would ultimately have nine children. At first, Albert felt constrained by his position as consort, which did not confer any power or duties upon him. Over time he adopted many public causes, such as educational reform and a worldwide abolition of slavery, and took on the responsibilities of running the Queen's household, estates and office. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851. Albert aided in the development of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to show less partisanship in her dealings with Parliament—although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary.
He died at the early age of 42, plunging the Queen into a deep mourning that lasted for the rest of her life. Upon Queen Victoria's death in 1901, their eldest son, Edward VII, succeeded as the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, named after the ducal house to which Albert belonged.

The Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta ([tpl]Lang-it|Sovrano Militare Ordine Ospedaliero di San Giovanni di Gerusalemme di Rodi e di Malta[/tpl]), also known as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), Order of Malta or Knights of Malta, is a Roman Catholic lay religious order of, traditionally, a military, chivalrous and noble nature.Mission of the Order - website Sovereign Order of Malta It is the world's oldest surviving order of chivalry.Sainty, Guy Stair, ed.

The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is headquartered in Rome, and is widely considered a sovereign subject of international law.Riley-Smith, 170 [tpl]Request quotation|date=September 2011[/tpl]
SMOM is the modern continuation of the original medieval order of Saint John of Jerusalem,Joint Declaration of SMOM and the Alliance of the Orders of St John of Jerusalem, Rome, 22 October 2004. known as the "Fraternitas Hospitalaria" and later as the Knights Hospitaller, a group founded in Jerusalem about 1050 as an Amalfitan hospital to provide care for poor and sick pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade, it became a military order under its own charter. Following the loss of Christian held territories of the Holy Land to Muslims, the Order operated from Rhodes (1310–1523), and later from Malta (1530–1798), over which it was sovereign.
Although this state came to an end with the ejection of the Order from Malta by Napoleon Bonaparte, the Order as such survived. It retains its claims of sovereignty under international law and has been granted permanent observer status at the United Nations.Permanent Observer Mission of the Order of Malta to the United Nations in New York official website. Retrieved 2010-08-02. The order is notable for issuing its own international passports for travel, postal stamps, along with its formal insignia, often portrayed as a white or gold Maltese cross. The order nominally invokes the Blessed Virgin Mary under the venerated Marian title of "Our Lady of Mount Philermos" as its patroness and spiritual intercessor.
Today the order has about 13,000 members; 80,000 permanent volunteers; and 20,000 medical personnel including doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and paramedics in more than 120 countries. The goal is to assist the elderly, handicapped, refugeed, children, homeless, those with terminal illness and leprosy in all parts of the world, without distinction of race or religion.As the Order's website states here, "Its programmes include medical and social assistance, disaster relief in the case of armed conflicts and natural catastrophes, emergency services and first aid corps, help for the elderly, the handicapped and children in need and the provision of first aid training, and support for refugees and internally displaced persons regardless of race, origin or religion." In several countries—including France, Germany and Ireland—the local associations of the Order are important providers of first aid training, first aid services and emergency medical services. Through its worldwide relief corps—Malteser International—the Order is also engaged to aid victims of natural disasters, epidemics and armed conflicts.
In February 2013 the order celebrated its 900th anniversary recognising the Papal bull of sovereignty "Pie Postulatio Voluntatis" formally issued by Pope Paschal II on 15 February 1113, with a general audience given by Pope Benedict XVI[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21388516|title= Knights of Malta Catholic order celebrates 900 years|date= 2013-02-09|publisher= BBC News|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EKtZ9qFQ|archivedate= 2013-02-10|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2013-02-10[/tpl] and a Holy Mass celebrated by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone at Saint Peter's Basilica.

[[Periodic function]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus, Elementary mathematics, Fourier analysis, Types of functions

In mathematics, a periodic function  is a function that repeats its values in regular intervals or periods.  The most important examples are the trigonometric functions, which repeat over intervals of 2π radians. Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves, and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity. Any function which is not periodic is called aperiodic.

[[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]]

CATEGORIES: 1788 births, 1865 deaths, Danish archaeologists, Directors of museums in Denmark, Prehistorians

Christian Jürgensen Thomsen (December 29, 1788 – May 21, 1865) was a Danish antiquarian who developed early archaeological techniques and methods.
In 1816 he was appointed head of 'antiquarian' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. 
Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen's study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from "closed finds", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836. An English translation was produced in 1848.

[[Guide dog]]

CATEGORIES: Assistance dogs, Blindness

Guide dogs are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles.
Although the dogs can be trained to navigate various obstacles, they are partially (red–green) color blind and are not capable of interpreting street signs. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. The handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog is the pilot, who gets them there safely.
In several countries, guide dogs, along with most service and hearing dogs, are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places such as restaurants and public transportation.

Dromaius novaehollandiae) is the largest bird native to Australia and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. It is the second-largest extant bird in the world by height, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. There are three subspecies of emus in Australia. The emu is common over most of mainland Australia, although it avoids heavily populated areas, dense forest, and arid areas.
The soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds reach up to [tpl]convert|2|m|ft[/tpl] in height. They have long thin necks and legs. Emus can travel great distances at a fast, economical trot and, if necessary, can sprint at [tpl]convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| title = Emu | publisher = NSW department of Environment & Heritage | url = http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/TheEmu.htm | accessdate = 5 February 2013[/tpl] Their long legs allow them to take strides of up to [tpl]convert|275|cm|ft[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Davies, S. J. J. F.|year=1963 |title= Emus |journal=Australian Natural History |volume=14 |pages=225–229[/tpl] They are opportunistically nomadic and may travel long distances to find food; they feed on a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without food. Emus ingest stones, glass shards and bits of metal to grind food in the digestive system. They drink infrequently, but take in copious fluids when the opportunity arises. Emus will sit in water and are also able to swim. They are curious birds who are known to follow and watch other animals and humans. Emus do not sleep continuously at night but in several short stints sitting down.
Emus use their strongly clawed feet as a defence mechanism. Their legs are among the strongest of any animal, allowing them to rip metal wire fences. They are endowed with good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect predators in the vicinity. The plumage varies regionally, matching the surrounding environment and improving its camouflage. The feather structure prevents heat from flowing into the skin, permitting Emus to be active during the midday heat. They can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and thermoregulate effectively. Males and females are hard to distinguish visually, but can be differentiated by the types of loud sounds they emit by manipulating an inflatable neck sac. Emus breed in May and June and are not monogamous; fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several batches of eggs in one season. The animals put on weight before the breeding season, and the male does most of the incubation, losing significant weight during this time as he does not eat. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain with their family until the next breeding season half a year later. Emus can live between 10 and 20 years in the wild and are predated by dingos, eagles and hawks. They can jump and kick to avoid dingos, but against eagles and hawks, they can only run and swerve.
The Tasmanian Emu and King Island Emu subspecies that previously inhabited Tasmania and King Island became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788, and the distribution of the mainland subspecies has been influenced by human activities. Once common on the east coast, emus are now uncommon there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions, and it is of Least Concern for conservation. They were a food and fuel source for indigenous Australians and early European settlers. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil, and leather. Emu is a lean meat and while it is often claimed by marketers that the oil has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, this has not been scientifically verified in humans. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia. It appears on the coat of arms, various coins, features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology, and hundreds of places are named after the bird.

Louis Pierre Althusser ([tpl]IPA-fr|altysɛʁ|lang[/tpl]; 16 October 1918 – 22 October 1990) was a French Marxist philosopher. He was born in Algeria and studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.
Althusser was a longtime member—although sometimes a strong critic—of the French Communist Party. His arguments and thesis were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties, as well as the problem of the "cult of personality" and of ideology.
Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism.
Althusser's life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In 1980, he murdered his wife by strangling her.

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]

CATEGORIES: 20th-century philosophy, Continental philosophy, Phenomenology, Philosophical methodology, Philosophical movements, Social philosophy

Phenomenology (from Greek: phainómenon "that which appears" and lógos "study") is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.
Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. This ontology (study of reality) can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.
Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by himself but also by students, such as Edith Stein, by hermeneutic philosophers, such as Martin Heidegger, by existentialists, such as Max Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and by other philosophers, such as Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Emmanuel Lévinas, and sociologists Alfred Schütz and Eric Voegelin.

[[Service dog]]

CATEGORIES: Assistance dogs, Dogs

A service dog is a type of assistance dog specifically trained to help people who have disabilities including visual difficulties, hearing impairments, mental illness, seizures, diabetes, autism, and more.
Desirable character traits in service animals typically include good temperament or psychological make-up (including biddability and trainability) and good health (including physical structure and stamina). Service dogs are often trained and bred by service dog organizations. Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, and  Golden Retrievers are the most common breeds used as service dogs, but any breed or mix of breeds is capable of being a service dog, though few dogs have all of the health and temperament qualities needed. Such a dog may be called a "service dog" or an "assistance dog," depending largely on country. Occasionally they are incorrectly referred to as "Seeing Eye Dogs"; this, however, refers to a specific organization and not to all Guide Dogs.

[[Perpendicular]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary geometry, Orientation

In elementary geometry, the word perpendicular describes the relationship between two lines which meet at a right angle.
A line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines intersect at a right angle.[tpl]harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91[/tpl] Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if 1) the two lines meet and 2) at the point of intersection the straight angle on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two congruent angles. Perpendicularity can be shown to be symmetric, meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order. 
A line is said to be perpendicular to a plane if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. Note that this definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines. 
Two planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the dihedral angle at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees). 
In fact, perpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of orthogonality; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus in advanced mathematics, the word perpendicular is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its normal.

The Château de Villandry is a castle-palace located in Villandry, in the département of Indre-et-Loire, France.
The lands where an ancient fortress once stood were known as Colombier until the 17th century. Acquired  in the early 16th century by Jean Le Breton, France's Controller-General for War under King Francis I, a new château was constructed around the original 14th-century keep where King Philip II of France once met Richard I of England to discuss peace.
It is also known for its beautiful gardens.
The château remained in the Le Breton family for more than two centuries until it was acquired by the Marquis de Castellane. During the French Revolution the property was confiscated and in the early 19th century, Emperor Napoleon acquired it for his brother Jérôme Bonaparte.
In 1906, Joachim Carvallo purchased the property and poured an enormous amount of time, money and devotion into repairing it and creating what many consider to be the most beautiful gardens anywhere. Its famous Renaissance gardens include a water garden, ornamental flower gardens, and vegetable gardens.  The gardens are laid out in formal patterns created with low box hedges. In 1934, Château de Villandry was designated a Monument historique. Like all the other châteaux of the Loire Valley, it is a World Heritage Site.
Still owned by the Carvallo family, the Château de Villandry is open to the public and is one of the most visited châteaux in France; in 2007 the château received about 330,000 visitors.[tpl]citation |last=Garrett |first=Martin |year=2010 |title=The Loire: a Cultural History |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199768394 |page=xxii[/tpl]

[[Right angle]]

CATEGORIES: Angle

In geometry and trigonometry, a right angle is an angle that bisects the angle formed by two halves of a straight line. More precisely, if a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles.Wentworth p. 8 As a rotation, a right angle corresponds to a quarter turn (that is, a quarter of a full circle).Wentworth p. 11
Closely related and important geometrical concepts are perpendicular lines, meaning lines that form right angles at their point of intersection, and orthogonality, which is the property of forming right angles, usually applied to vectors. The presence of a right angle in a triangle is the defining factor for right triangles,Wentworth p. 40 making the right angles basic to trigonometry.
The term is a calque of Latin angulus rectus; here rectus means "upright", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.

The national language, Danish, is closely related to and mutually intelligible with Swedish and Norwegian.
The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary constitutional monarchy, with Margrethe II as queen regnant, organised as a parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. The Constitution has been revised four times, most recently in 1953. The seat of government is in the capital of Copenhagen. Denmark[tpl]efn|name="proper"[/tpl] exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving political powers to handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973, maintaining four opt-outs from European Union policies, as outlined in the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement. Both the Faroe Islands and Greenland remain outside the Union.
The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark was part of the Kalmar Union, established in 1397, ended with Swedish secession in 1523. The following year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway, which lasted nearly three centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of Danish territory; these culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, Denmark was invaded by Germany with brief, military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. Denmark joined NATO in 1949, relinquishing its historically neutral stance. An industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early decades of the 20th century, making the basis for the present welfare state with a highly developed mixed market economy.

[[Limited animation]]

CATEGORIES: Animation techniques

Limited animation is a process of making animated cartoons that does not redraw entire frames but variably reuses common parts between frames. One of its major characteristics is stylized design in all forms and shapes, which in the early days was referred to as modern design. The short-subject and feature-length cartoons of Walt Disney from the 1930s and 1940s are widely acclaimed for depicting animated simulations of reality, with exquisite detail in every frame. This style of animation is time-consuming and expensive. "Limited" animation creates an image with abstract art, symbolism, and fewer drawings to create the same effect, at a much lower cost. This style of animation depends upon animators' skill in emulating change without additional drawings; improper use of limited animation is easily recognized as unnatural. It also encourages the animators to indulge in artistic styles that are not bound to real-world limits. The result is an artistic style that could not have developed if animation was solely devoted to producing simulations of reality. Without limited animation, such groundbreaking films as Yellow Submarine, Chuck Jones' The Dot and the Line, and many others could never have been produced.
The process of limited animation aims to reduce the overall number of drawings. Film is projected at 24 frames per second. For movements in normal speed, most animation in general is done "on twos," meaning each drawing is displayed twice, for a total of 12 drawings per 24 frames per second. Faster movements may demand animation "on ones" with a new drawing in each frame, while characters that do not move may be done with a single drawing (a "hold") for a certain amount of time. It is said[tpl]who|date=February 2013[/tpl] that the Disney average was about 18 drawings per second, pretending that all characters of a scene share the same sheet of paper. Limited animation mainly reduces the number of inbetweens, the drawings between the keyframes which define a movement, and can cause stuttering if inbetweens are poorly set up.
Overall, the use of limited animation does not necessarily imply lower quality as it allows the use of many time-saving techniques that can improve the quality and flow of the keyframes and overall presentation of an animation.

[[Electrocardiography]]

Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG from [tpl]lang-el|kardia, meaning heart[/tpl]) is the recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Traditionally this is in the form of a transthoracic (across the thorax or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin and recorded or displayed by a device external to the body.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/120/ecg-100-steps | title=ECG- simplified. Aswini Kumar M.D. | publisher=LifeHugger | accessdate=2010-02-11[/tpl] The recording produced by this noninvasive procedure is termed an electrocardiogram (also ECG or EKG).  It is possible to record ECGs invasively using an implantable loop recorder.
An ECG is used to measure the heart’s electrical conduction system.Walraven, G. (2011). Basic arrhythmias (7th ed.) 1-11 It picks up electrical impulses generated by the polarization and depolarization of cardiac tissue and translates into a waveform. The waveform is then used to measure the rate and regularity of heartbeats, as well as the size and position of the chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart, and the effects of drugs or devices used to regulate the heart, such as a pacemaker.
Most ECGs are performed for diagnostic or research purposes on human hearts, but may also be performed on animals, usually for diagnosis of heart abnormalities or research.

Tartaric acid is a white crystalline diprotic acid. This aldaric acid occurs naturally in many plants, particularly grapes, bananas, and tamarinds, is commonly combined with baking soda to function as a leavening agent in recipes, and is one of the main acids found in wine. It is added to other foods to give a sour taste, and is used as an antioxidant. Salts of tartaric acid are known as tartrates. It is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid.
Tartaric acid was first isolated from potassium tartrate, known to the ancients as tartar, circa 800 AD, by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XuPWgEMx_eIC&pg=PA29|page=29|title=Vinegars of the World|author=Lisa Solieri, Paolo Giudici|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=88-470-0865-4[/tpl] The modern process was developed in 1769 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele.
Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of ammonium sodium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals under magnification, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid.L.

[[Self-organizing map]]
CATEGORIES: Neural networks, Dimension reduction, Data clustering algorithms

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. Self-organizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
This makes SOMs useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling. The model was first described as an artificial neural network by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen, and is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network.[tpl]cite web |title=Kohonen Network |last1=Kohonen |first1=Teuvo |last2=Honkela |first2=Timo |year=2007 |work=Scholarpedia |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kohonen_network [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Kohonen |first=Teuvo |year=1982 |title=Self-Organized Formation of Topologically Correct Feature Maps |journal=Biological Cybernetics |volume=43 |number=1 |pages=59–69 |doi=10.1007/bf00337288[/tpl]
Like most artificial neural networks, SOMs operate in two modes: training and mapping. "Training" builds the map using input examples (a competitive process, also called vector quantization), while "mapping" automatically classifies a new input vector.
A self-organizing map consists of components called nodes or neurons. Associated with each node is a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data vectors and a position in the map space. The usual arrangement of nodes is a two-dimensional regular spacing in a hexagonal or rectangular grid. The self-organizing map describes a mapping from a higher-dimensional input space to a lower-dimensional map space. The procedure for placing a vector from data space onto the map is to find the node with the closest (smallest distance metric) weight vector to the data space vector.
While it is typical to consider this type of network structure as related to feedforward networks where the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation.
Useful extensions include using toroidal grids where opposite edges are connected and using large numbers of nodes. 
It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to K-means, larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character. [tpl]cite web |title=Self-organizing map |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Self-organizing_map.html [/tpl]
It is also common to use the U-Matrix.[tpl]cite book |first=Alfred |last=Ultsch |first2=H. Peter |last2=Siemon |chapter=Kohonen's Self Organizing Feature Maps for Exploratory Data Analysis |title=Proceedings of the International Neural Network Conference (INNC-90), Paris, France, July 9–13, 1990 |pages=305–308 |editor1-first=Bernard |editor1-last=Widrow |editor2-first=Bernard |editor2-last=Angeniol |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |year=1990 |volume=1 |isbn=978-0-7923-0831-7 |url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/datenbionik/pdf/pubs/1990/UltschSiemon90 [/tpl] The U-Matrix value of a particular node is the average distance between the node and its closest neighbors. In a square grid, for instance, we might consider the closest 4 or 8 nodes (the Von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods, respectively), or six nodes in a hexagonal grid.
Large SOMs display emergent properties. In maps consisting of thousands of nodes, it is possible to perform cluster operations on the map itself.[tpl]cite book |first=Alfred |last=Ultsch |chapter=Emergence in Self-Organizing Feature Maps |title=Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps (WSOM '07) |editor1-first=H. |editor1-last=Ritter |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Haschke |publisher=Neuroinformatics Group |location=Bielefeld, Germany |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-00-022473-7 [/tpl]

The glass catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhis) is an Asian glass catfish of the genus Kryptopterus. Until 1989, it included its smaller relative the ghost catfish, now known as K. minor. Its scientific name and common name are often still used in the aquarium fish trade to refer to the ghost catfish; as it seems, the larger and more aggressive K. bicirrhis was only ever exported in insignificant numbers, if at all.
In western Borneo, where they are sympatric, both K. minor and K. bicirrhis are collectively known as lais tipis in the Malay language, but when locals want to distinguish the two, they refer to the glass catfish as lais limpok. In Cambodia, where it is known as trey kes prak, the Khmer people use the ghost catfish as a key ingredient in the fine fish condiment prahoc.

The Animals were an English band of the 1960s, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No.1 hit single, "The House of the Rising Sun", as well as by hits such as  "We Gotta Get out of This Place", "It's My Life", "I'm Crying" and "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They were known in the US as part of the British Invasion.
The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals, the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and hard rock band with hits like "San Franciscan Nights", "When I Was Young" and "Sky Pilot", before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100.
The original lineup had brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

The Priory Church of Saint Mary, Bushmead, commonly called Bushmead Priory, was a monastic foundation for Augustinian Canons, located at Bushmead (a Hamlet in Staploe parish) in the County of Bedfordshire in England. It is a Grade I listed building.
The site and remains of the 700 year old priory stand today neighbouring a light industrial estate, and disused airfield, and lies between the villages of Colmworth and Little Staughton.  Nothing survives of the priory church, and all but the refectory and kitchen of the claustral buildings have disappeared. 
Never a large house, the community appears to have consisted of the prior and up to four canons. 
The priory was founded around 1195 by William, Chaplain of Colmworth.Or 1185 by Hugh de Beauchamp according to Henry Thorold, Collins Guide to the Ruined Abbeys of England, Wales and Scotland Hugh de Beauchamp of Eaton Socon endowed the priory with 28 acres (113,000 m²), the priory also held land around Coppingford chapel; during these early years it also  held a considerable number of Selions, given to them by local people as gifts of faith.  Around 1206 King John permitted the monks to enclose and clear part of the nearby Perry woods.
After William's death in 1215, Joseph, Chaplain of Coppingford, became head of the fraternity.  Under his guidance the house became an Augustinian priory.  The Augustinians, were then a comparatively new order, which ordained priests, but  lived in community similar in style to monks.   
Throughout the following years the priory prospered through gifts and grants.   The monks wrote documents illustrating their daily lives, these became books of charters, called Cartularies.  Unfortunately through the centuries very few of these charters have survived.
It was common for monastic orders at this time to be the beneficiaries of generous donations.  However, it was equally common for disapproving heirs to object to the size of these gifts donated from their potential estates.  One such heir was John Pateschull, unhappy at a bequest of £8 per annum in the will of his grandfather, after a dispute lasting many years, he had had the priory’s cattle seized.  Richard of Staughton, a senior Canon and later prior of Bushmead, called the bailiff and set out to recover them.  The senior Canon was seized by John Pateschull’s men and imprisoned.  The dispute was finally ended through arbitration.
When Richard of Staughton became prior, he obtained permission from the bishop to form a boys' school; however it is thought he died of the Black Death before the project could be implemented.
The prior in 1418 was Robert Tychemerssh. Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40 / 629; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/aCP40no629fronts/IMG_0291.htm; ninth entry, as defendant 
Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII, the ownership of Bushmead Priory became the subject of a dispute  between the St. John family of Bletsoe and Sir William Gascoigne of Cardington, the latter being Cardinal Wolsey's controller of the household.  He had previously exchanged land with King Henry VIII and sought further recompense.  The King waited until 1537, almost a year after the priory’s dissolution, before allowing the priory to pass to Sir William.
Fifteen years later, in 1562, a Cambridgeshire man, William Gery, purchased the estate and almost immediately began building on the site of the priory.  Around a hundred years later Richard Gery extended the site and formed a mansion (since demolished).  There have obviously been many changes to the priory.  A new floor, and fenestration (in the lower section) were fitted circa 1500, although only the rafters now remain.  Clearly visible, though, are the major and various subsequent minor alterations, giving an interesting insight into its architectural history. 
It is a rare example of King post, and timber frame roof architecture.http://www.britainexpress.com/counties/bedfordshire/bushmead.htm
The site is now in the care of the English Heritage Commission and is open to the public at weekends during Spring and Summer.

Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect human health. It can also include substances harmful to animals.
The term and its associated symbol are generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions.  The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the Dow Chemical Company on the containment products.[tpl]cite journal|title=Symbol Making|journal=New York Times Magazine|date=November 18, 2001|url=http://www.oseh.umich.edu/pdf/HistoryofBiohazardSymbol.pdf[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Biohazard Symbol History[/tpl]

Louis XIII (27 September 1601 – 14 May 1643) was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1610 to 1643 and King of Navarre (as Louis II) from 1610 to 1620, when the crown of Navarre was merged to the French crown.
Louis succeeded his father Henry IV as king of France and Navarre a few months before his ninth birthday. His mother, Marie de' Medici, acted as regent during Louis's minority. Mismanagement of the kingdom and ceaseless political intrigues by Marie de' Medici and her Italian favourites led the young king to take power in 1617 by exiling his mother and executing her followers, including Concino Concini, the most influential Italian at the French court.
Louis XIII, taciturn and suspicious, relied heavily on his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu to govern the kingdom of France. King and cardinal are remembered for the establishment of the Académie française and for putting an end to the revolt of the French nobility. The reign of Louis "the Just" was also marked by the struggles against Huguenots and Habsburg Spain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/louis-xiii-of-france |title=Schneider, Robert A.

France's greatest victory in the conflicts against the Habsburg Empire during the period 1635-59 came at the Battle of Rocroi (1643), five days after Louis's death from apparent complications of intestinal tuberculosis.

It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, didn't reappear until the Mac OS X operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster 68000 processor (7.89 MHz) and sound, however, while the complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957), better known as V. Gordon Childe, was an Australian archaeologist and philologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory. Working most of his life as an academic in the United Kingdom for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, he wrote many influential books and was an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology and Marxist archaeology.
Born in Sydney, New South Wales, Childe studied at the University of Sydney before moving to England to study at the University of Oxford. Returning to Australia, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist views, instead working for the Australian Labor Party. Emigrating to London, he continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books.
From 1927 through to 1946 he worked as the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, overseeing excavation of the unique Neolithic settlement of Skara Brae and the chambered tomb of Maeshowe, both in Orkney, Scotland. Becoming co-founder and president of The Prehistoric Society, he embraced Marxism and became a noted sympathiser with the Soviet Union. From 1947 to 1957 he worked as director of the Institute of Archaeology, continuing to publish his research. Upon retirement, he returned home to the Australian Blue Mountains, there committing suicide.
Widely regarded as one of the most important archaeologists and prehistorians of his generation, he became known as the "great synthesizer" for his work in synthesizing regional research into a broader picture of Near Eastern and European prehistory. He was also renowned for his emphasis on revolutionary technological and economic developments in human society, such as the Neolithic Revolution and the Urban Revolution, in this manner being influenced by Marxist ideas on societal development.

The son of Louis the Quarreler and Clementia of Hungary, sister of Charles I of Hungary, he is the only person to be King of France since birth, and thus, the youngest King of France.
John reigned for five days under the regency of his uncle Philip the Tall, until his death on 20 November 1316. The infant King was buried in Saint Denis Basilica. He was succeeded by Philip, whose contested legitimacy led to the re-affirmation of the Salic law.

Philip IV (April–June 1268 – 29 November 1314), called the Fair ([tpl]lang-fr|Philippe le Bel[/tpl]), was King of France from 1285 until his death. By virtue of his marriage with Joan I of Navarre, he was also, as Philip I,  King of Navarre and Count of Champagne from 1284 to 1305.
Philip relied on skillful civil servants, such as Guillaume de Nogaret and Enguerrand de Marigny, to govern the kingdom rather than on his barons. Philip and his advisors were instrumental in the transformation of France from a feudal country to a centralized state. Philip, who sought an uncontested monarchy, compelled his vassals by wars and restricted feudal usages.  His ambitions made him highly influential in European affairs. His goal was to place his relatives on thrones. Princes from his house ruled in Naples and Hungary. He tried and failed to make another relative the Holy Roman Emperor.  He began the long advance of France eastward by taking control of scattered fiefs.C. W. Previte-Orton, A history of Europe: from 1198 to 1378 (1951) pp 259
The most notable conflicts include a dispute with Edward I of England, who was also his vassal as the Duke of Aquitaine, and a war with the County of Flanders, which gained temporary autonomy following Philip’s embarrassing defeat at the battle of the Golden Spurs (1302).
In 1306, Philip the Fair expelled the Jews from France and, in 1307, annihilated the order of the Knights Templar. Philip was in debt to both groups and saw them as a "state within the state".
To further strengthen the monarchy, Philip tried to control the French clergy and entered in conflict with Pope Boniface VIII. This conflict led to the transfer of the papal court in the enclave of Avignon in 1309.
His final year saw a scandal amongst the royal family, known as the Tour de Nesle Affair, during which the three daughters-in-law of Philip were accused of adultery. His three sons were successively kings of France, namely: Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV.

[[Spaceflight]]
CATEGORIES: Spaceflight

Spaceflight (also written space flight) is ballistic flight into or through outer space. Spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board. Examples of human spaceflight include the Russian Soyuz program, the U.S. Space shuttle program, as well as the ongoing International Space Station. Examples of unmanned spaceflight include space probes which leave Earth's orbit, as well as satellites in orbit around Earth, such as communication satellites. These operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous.
Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites.
A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft — both when unpropelled and when under propulsion — is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

[[Acantha]]
CATEGORIES: Metamorphoses in Greek mythology, Nymphs

Acantha (Greek: Ἀκάνθα, English translation: "thorny") was a minor character in Greek mythology. She was a nymph loved by Apollo, the sun god. In one version of the story, Acantha refused Apollo's advances and scratched his face when he tried to rape her. Apollo then turned her into an acanthus plant.Women in Greek Myths, "Acantha", Accessed: 11 June 2006.  Another version features Acantha as a mortal man who returned Apollo's advances.OEDILF "Acantha" The matter of Acantha's identity is further confused by the fact that the acanthus plant is not a tree, but a shrub or bush, and therefore is unlikely to have had a nymph associated with it. This may simply indicate that it was perceived to be a tree at the time the myth was created.

[[English cuisine]]
CATEGORIES: English cuisine

English cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, largely due to the importation of ingredients and ideas from places such as North America, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.
In the Early Modern Period the food of England was historically characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce. It is possible the effects of this can still be seen in traditional cuisine.
Traditional meals have ancient origins, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths, and freshwater and saltwater fish. The 14th-century English cookbook, the Forme of Cury, contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II. In the second half of the 18th century Rev. Gilbert White, in The Natural History of Selborne made note of the increased consumption of vegetables by ordinary country people in the south of England, to which, he noted, potatoes had only been added during the reign of George III: "Green-stalls in cities now support multitudes in comfortable state, while gardeners get fortunes. Every decent labourer also has his garden, which is half his support; and common farmers provide plenty of beans, peas, and greens, for their hinds to eat with their bacon."White Letter XXXVII (1778).
Other meals, such as fish and chips, which were once urban street food eaten from newspaper with salt and malt vinegar, and pies and sausages with mashed potatoes, onions, and gravy, are now matched in popularity by curries from the Indian subcontinent, and stir-fries based on Chinese and Thai cuisine. French cuisine and  Italian cuisine are also now widely adapted. Britain was also quick to adopt the innovation of fast food from the United States, and continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world while at the same time rediscovering its roots in sustainable rural agriculture.

Dial M for Murder is a 1954 American crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings. The movie was adapted from a successful stage play by Frederick Knott, and was released by the Warner Bros. studio.
The screenplay and the stage play on which it was based were both written by English playwright Frederick Knott, whose work often focused on women who innocently become the potential victims of sinister plots. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC television, before being performed on the stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October.
The single setting in the stage play is the living-room of the Wendices' flat in London (61A Charrington Gardens, Maida Vale). Hitchcock's film adds a second setting in a gentleman's club, the well of a staircase, a few views of the street outside, and a stylized courtroom montage. Having seen the play on Broadway, Cary Grant was keen to play the role of Tony Wendice, but studio chiefs did not feel the public would accept him as a man who arranges to have his wife murdered.
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its "Ten Top Ten" list—the best ten films in ten "classic" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Dial M for Murder was ranked the ninth best film in the mystery genre.[tpl]cite news | publisher=American Film Institute | title=AFI's 10 Top 10 | date=2008-06-17 | url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/mystery.html | accessdate=2008-06-18[/tpl]

[[Zagreus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods, Greek mythology, Cult of Dionysus, Offspring of Persephone

In ancient Greek religion and myth, the obscure and ancient figure of Zagreus ([tpl]lang-el|Ζαγρεύς[/tpl]) was identified with the god DionysusKarl Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal image of indestructible life,  (Princeton University Press) 1976:esp. pp 80–89. and was worshipped by followers of Orphism, whose late Orphic hymns invoke his name.
A single early appearance of Zagreus is in a quoted line from the lost epic Alkmeonis, written in the sixth century BC if not earlier: "Mistress Earth and Zagreus who art above all other gods."Fragment in G. Kinkel, ed. Epicorum Graecorum fragmenta, quoted in Kerenyi 1976:83. An invocation linking him with the earth goddess Gaia and placing him above all other gods, could not fit easily into the Olympian religion of Zeus.
In Greek a hunter who catches living animals is called zagreus, Karl Kerenyi notes, and the Ionian word zagre signifies a "pit for the capture of live animals"Kerenyi (1976:82) quotes Hesychius, who gives characteristically Ionian Greek endings. 
Greeks in Crete preserved a tradition that Zagreus was the son of Zeus and Persephone.Diodorus Siculus, v. 75.4: "they allege that the god was born of Zeus and Persephone in Crete, and Orpheus in the mysteries represents him as torn in pieces by the Titans"; Julius Firmicus Maternus, De errore profanarum religionum, vi 5 (noted by Kerenyi 1976:83 note 109. Two passing references by Aeschylus link Zagreus with Hades (Pluto) and identify him as Hades' son; in his Cretan Men, which survives in quoted fragments, Aeschylus mentions the "thunders of the noctural Zagreus". "We may justifiably ask," observes Kerenyi,Kereny 1976: "The Cretan core of the Dionysos myth", 83f. "Why was this great mythical hunter, who in Greece became a mysterious god of the underworld, a capturer of wild animals and not a killer?" Kerenyi links the figure of Zagreus with archaic Dionysiac rites in which small animals were torn limb from limb and their flesh devoured raw, "not as an emanation of the Greek Dionysian religion, but rather as a migration or survival of a prehistoric rite."Kereny 1976:85.

In Greek mythology, maenads (Greek: μαινάδες, mainádes) were the female followers of Dionysus (Bacchus in the Roman pantheon), and the most significant members of the Thiasus, the god's retinue. Their name literally translates as "raving ones". Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus into a state of ecstatic frenzy, through a combination of dancing and intoxication.[tpl]cite book | last = Wiles | first = David | title = Greek Theatre Performance: An Introduction | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge, England | url = http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X [/tpl]  During these rites, the maenads would dress in fawn skins and carry a thyrsus, a long stick wrapped in ivy or vine leaves and tipped with a pinecone; they would weave ivy-wreaths around their heads or wear a bull helmet in honor of their god, and often handle or wear snakes.Ernest L. Abel, Intoxication in Mythology: A Worldwide Dictionary of Gods, Rites, Intoxicants, and Place McFarland; Jefferson, NC and London 2006. German philologist Walter Friedrich Otto writes that
The maddened Hellenic women of real life were mythologized as the mad women who were nurses of Dionysus in Nysa: Lycurgus "chased the Nurses of the frenzied Dionysus through the holy hills of Nysa, and the sacred implements dropped to the ground from the hands of one and all, as the murderous Lycurgus struck them down with his ox-goad."Homer, Iliad, VI.130ff, in E.V. Rieu's translation. They went into the mountains at night and practised strange rites.[tpl] cite book | last = Lever | first = Katherine | title = The Art of Greek Comedy | year = 1956 [/tpl]
In Macedon, according to Plutarch's Life of Alexander, they were called Mimallones and Klodones, epithets derived from the feminine art of spinning wool;According to Grace Harriet Macurdy, "Klodones, Mimallones and Dionysus Pseudanor", The Classical Review 27.6 (September 1913), pp. 191-192, and Troy and Paeonia. With Glimpses of Ancient Balkan History and Religion, 1925, p. 166. nevertheless, these warlike parthenoi ("virgins") from the hills, associated with a shamanic Dionysios pseudanor, routed an invading enemy.According to the second-century CE Macedonian military writer Polyaenus, IV.1; Polyaenus gives a fanciful etymology.. In southern Greece they were described as Bacchae, Bassarides, Thyiades, PotniadesPotnia, the "power" of maddened intoxication. and given other epithets.Harrison, "The Maenads", Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 3rd ed. (1922:388-400) p. 388.
The maenads were also known as Bassarids (or Bacchae or Bacchantes) in Roman mythology, after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a fox-skin, a bassaris.
In Euripides' play The Bacchae, Theban maenads murdered King Pentheus after he banned the worship of Dionysus. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lured Pentheus to the woods, where the maenads tore him apart. His corpse was mutilated by his own mother, Agave, who tore off his head, believing it to be that of a lion.
A group of maenads also killed Orpheus.Apollodorus (Pseudo Apollodorus), Library and Epitome, 1.3.2. "Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the maenads he is buried in Pieria."
In Greek vase painting, the frolicking of maenads and Dionysus is often a theme depicted on Greek kraters, used to mix water and wine. These scenes show the maenads in their frenzy running in the forests, often tearing to pieces any animal they happen to come across.

CATEGORIES: Plays by Euripides, Theban mythology, Culture of Macedon, Dionysus

The Bacchae ([tpl]lang-grc|Βάκχαι[/tpl], Bakchai; also known as The Bacchantes) is an ancient Greek tragedy by the Athenian playwright Euripides, during his final years in Macedonia, at the court of Archelaus I of Macedon. It premièred posthumously at the Theatre of Dionysus in 405 BC as part of a tetralogy that also included Iphigeneia at Aulis and Alcmaeon in Corinth, and which Euripides' son or nephew probably directed.Rehm (1992, 23). It won first prize in the City Dionysia festival competition.
The tragedy is based on the mythological story of King Pentheus of Thebes and his mother Agave, and their punishment by the god Dionysus (who is Pentheus' cousin) because he refuses to worship him.

In Greek mythology, Pentheus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|θ|uː|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|θ|j|uː|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Πενθεύς[/tpl]) was a king of Thebes.  His father was Echion, the wisest of the Spartes.  His mother was Agave, the daughter of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, and the goddess Harmonia. His sister was Epeiros.
Much of what is known about the character comes from the interpretation of the myth in Euripides' tragic play, The Bacchae.

Lithuanian (lietuvių kalba) is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 3.2 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 200,000 abroad. Lithuanian is a Baltic language, closely related to Latvian, although they are not mutually intelligible. It is written in a Latin alphabet.  The Lithuanian language is often said to be the most conservative living Indo-European language, retaining many features of Proto-Indo-European now lost in other Indo-European languages.[tpl]cite book | last = Zinkevičius | first = Z. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Rytų Lietuva praeityje ir dabar | publisher = Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidykla | year = 1993 | location = | page = 9| quote=...linguist generally accepted that Lithuanian language is the most archaic among live Indo-European languages...|url = | doi =  | isbn = 5-420-01085-2 [/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Government of Haiti

The Government of Haiti consists of a semi-presidential republic, pluriform[tpl]Clarify|date=February 2010|reason=See discussion page - word is not accurate enough in definition to explain the context it is used in[/tpl] multiparty system whereby the President of Haiti is head of state directly elected by popular vote. The Prime Minister acts as head of government, and is appointed by the President from the majority party in the National Assembly. Executive power is exercised by the President and Prime Minister who together constitute this branch of government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the National Assembly of Haiti. The government is organized unitarily, thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the Constitution of March 29, 1987.

Butler W. Lampson (born December 23, 1943) is a computer scientist.
After graduating from the Lawrenceville School (where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award, also known as the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville's highest award to alumni), Lampson received his Bachelor's degree in Physics from Harvard University in 1964, and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.
During the 1960s, Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965, several Project GENIE members, specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch, developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems' SDS 940 computer.
Lampson was one of the founding members of Xerox PARC in 1970, where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL). His now-famous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled "Why Alto?".DigiBarn Computer Museum: Why Alto? Butler Lampson's Historic 1972 Memo  In 1973, the Xerox Alto, with its three-button mouse and full-page-sized monitor was born.[ref]
</ref>
It is now considered to be the first actual personal computer (at least in terms of what has become the 'canonical' GUI mode of operation).   
All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC followed a general blueprint called "Wildflower", written by Lampson, and this included the D-Series Machines, the "Dolphin" (used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine), "Dandelion" (used in the Xerox 8010 model of the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine), "Dandetiger" (used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine), "Dorado" (used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine), "Daybreak" Xerox 6085, and "Dragon" (a 4-processor 6085 with one of the first snoopy caches, though never released to production).
At PARC, Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies, such as laser printer design; two-phase commit protocols; Bravo, the first WYSIWYG text formatting program; Ethernet, the first high-speed local area network (LAN); and designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid.
By the early 1980s, Lampson left Xerox PARC for Digital Equipment Corporation; he now works for Microsoft Research.  Lampson is also an adjunct professor at MIT.
In 1992, he won the distinguished ACM Turing Award for his contributions to personal computing and computer science and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. In 2004, he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize along with Alan C. Kay, Robert W. Taylor, and Charles P. Thacker for their work on Alto. In 2006 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum.
Lampson is often quoted as saying, "Any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of indirection," but in his Turing Award Lecturehttp://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/Slides/TuringLecture.doc in 1993, Lampson himself attributes this saying to David Wheeler.

Real-time strategy (RTS) is a sub-genre of strategy video games which does not progress incrementally in turns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110427052656/http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/ |archivedate=April 27, 2011 |title=A History of Real-Time Strategy Games |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |author=Bruce Geryk |publisher=GameSpot |quote=Early computer strategy games adhered firmly to the turn-based concepts of their board game ancestors, where—by necessity—players had time to plan their turns before their opponents had a chance to move.

I was deeply concerned that words like "strategy" and "wargame" would keep many players from even trying this completely new game dynamic. Before 1992, wargames and strategy games were very much niche markets—with the exception of Sid Meier's work—so my fears were justified. But in the end, it was best to call it an "RTS" because that is exactly what it was.

In an RTS, as in other wargames, the participants position and maneuver units and structures under their control to secure areas of the map and/or destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS, it is possible to create additional units and structures during the course of a game. This is generally limited by a requirement to expend accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game of the RTS genre features resource gathering, base building, in-game technological development and indirect control of units.[tpl]cite web |last=Geryk |first=Bruce |title=A History of Real-Time Strategy Games |publisher=GameSpot |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/ | accessdate=May 29, 2007[/tpl]
The tasks a player must perform to succeed at an RTS can be very demanding, and complex user interfaces have evolved to cope with the challenge. Some features have been borrowed from desktop environments; for example, the technique of "clicking and dragging" to select all units under a given area.
Though some game genres share conceptual and gameplay similarities with the RTS template, recognized genres are generally not subsumed as RTS games.[tpl]cite web |last=Adams |first=Dan |title=The State of the RTS |publisher=IGN |date=April 7, 2006 |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p1.html |accessdate=May 31, 2007[/tpl] For instance, city-building games, construction and management simulations, and games of the real-time tactics variety are generally not considered to be "real-time strategy".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/ |title=A History of Real-Time Strategy Games |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |author=Bruce Geryk |publisher=GameSpot |quote=Although games such as Populous and SimCity are certainly played in real time, these give rise to the "god game" genre, which includes such titles as the city-builder series from Impressions, Will Wright's innovative designs, and much of Peter Molyneux's work, including the upcoming Black & White.

The main goals in the design of the Alto's user input/output were generality of the facilities and simplicity of the hardware. We also attached a high value to modeling the capabilities of existing manual media; after all, these have evolved over many hundreds of years. There are good reasons for most of their characteristics, and much has been learned about how to use them effectively.

Celeron is a brand name given by Intel Corp. to a number of different IA-32 and x86-64 computer microprocessor models targeted at budget personal computers.
Celeron processors can run all IA-32 computer programs, but their performance is often significantly lower when compared to similar CPUs with higher-priced Intel CPU brands. For example, the Celeron brand will often have less cache memory, or have advanced features purposely disabled. These missing features can have a variable impact on performance, but is often very substantial. While a few of the Celeron designs have achieved surprising performance, most of the Celeron line has exhibited noticeably degraded performance.[tpl]cite news|last=Schmid|first=Patrick|title=The New Generation Is Here: Celeron 2.0 GHz, with 0.13 µm|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/2002/10/16/the_new_generation_is_here/|publisher=Tom's Hardware Guide|date=16 October 2002|accessdate=30 July 2007[/tpl] This has been the primary justification for the higher cost of other Intel CPU brands versus the Celeron range.

[[Water bowline]]

The water bowline is a type of knot designed for use in wet conditions where other knots may slip or jam.
Although similar in finished appearance to the double bowline, the water bowline is formed with a clove hitch as the loop in the standing part of the rope. This is similar to the double bowline, which puts the running end through a round turn. The additional friction from the clove hitch increases the security of this knot.

The Water Bowline can be tied very quickly by throwing two half hitches over the working end and then running the working end around the standing line and back through both half hitches. This is illustrated in the three pictures below.

The Olmec were the first major civilization in Mexico. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco.
The Olmec flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500 BCE, but by 1600–1500 BCE, Early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.[tpl]cite book|title=The Olmecs : America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25[/tpl] They were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.See Pool (2007) p. 2.  Although there is wide agreement that the Olmec culture helped lay the foundations for the civilizations that followed, there is disagreement over the extent of the Olmec contributions, and even a proper definition of the Olmec "culture".  See "Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures" for a deeper treatment of this question. Among other "firsts", the Olmec appeared to practice ritual bloodletting and played the Mesoamerican ballgame, hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies.
The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the aptly named "colossal heads".See, as one example, Diehl, p. 11. The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the pre-Columbian art market in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America's most striking.See Diehl, p. 108 for the "ancient America" superlatives.  The artist and archaeologist Miguel Covarrubias (1957) p. 50 says that Olmec pieces are among the world's masterpieces.

[[Modifier key]]

CATEGORIES: Computer keys, User interface techniques

In computing, a modifier key is a special key (or combination) on a computer keyboard that temporarily modifies the normal action of another key when pressed together. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing; that is, pressing any of the Shift, Alt, or Ctrl keys alone does not (generally) trigger any action from the computer.
For example, in most keyboard layouts the Shift key combination [tpl]keypress|Shift|A[/tpl] will produce a capital letter "A" instead of the default lower-case letter "a" (unless in Caps lock or Shift lock mode). A combination of [tpl]keypress|Alt|F4[/tpl] in Microsoft Windows will close the program in the active window; in this instance, Alt is the modifier key. In contrast, pressing just [tpl]keypress|Shift[/tpl] or [tpl]keypress|Alt[/tpl] will probably do nothing unless assigned a specific function in a particular program (for example, activating input aids or the toolbar of the active window in Windows).
User interface expert Jef Raskin coined the term "quasimode" to describe the state a computer enters into when a modifier key is pressed.

Joseph Henri Maurice "Rocket" Richard, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|CC|OQ|size=85%[/tpl] ([tpl]IPAc-en|r|ɨ|ˈ|ʃ|ɑr|d[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|ʁiʃaʁ|lang[/tpl]; August 4, 1921 – May 27, 2000) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens. A prolific scorer, he was the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in one season, accomplishing the feat in 50 games in 1944–45, and the first to score 500 career goals.  Richard retired in 1960 as the league's all-time leader in goals with 544. He won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player in 1947, played in 13 All-Star Games and was named to 14 post-season NHL All-Star Teams.
Richard joined with Elmer Lach and Toe Blake to form the "Punch line", a high-scoring forward line of the 1940s. He was a member of eight Stanley Cup championship teams, including five straight between 1956 and 1960 and holding the role of team captain for the last four. In honour of his career, the Hockey Hall of Fame waived its customary five-year waiting period after retirement for eligibility, and inducted Richard into the hall in 1961. In 1975, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. The Canadiens retired his sweater number 9 following his retirement and donated the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy to the NHL in 1998 to serve as an award to the league's leading goal scorer.
An outspoken and intense player, Richard was renowned for his physical, and occasionally violent, style of play. He was involved in a vicious on-ice incident late in the 1954–55 season during which he struck a linesman.  NHL President Clarence Campbell suspended him for the remainder of the season – including the playoffs – which precipitated the Richard Riot in Montreal.  The riot, which has taken on near mythical qualities in the decades since, is sometimes cited as a precursor to Quebec's Quiet Revolution. Richard was a cultural icon among Quebec's francophone population; he was a central figure in Roch Carrier's short story The Hockey Sweater, itself a quintessential work of Canadian literature.  The province of Quebec honoured Richard with the first Quebec state funeral for a non-politician.

[[Alcestis]]

CATEGORIES: Thessalian mythology, Women in Greek mythology

Alcestis ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἄλκηστις[/tpl]) is a princess in Greek mythology, known for her love of her husband. Her story was popularised in Euripides's tragedy Alcestis. She was the daughter of Pelias, king of Iolcus, and either Anaxibia or Phylomache.
In the story, many suitors appeared before King Pelias, her father, when she became of age to marry. It was declared she would marry the first man to yoke a lion and a boar (or a bear in some cases) to a chariot. The man who would do this, King Admetus, was helped by Apollo, who had been banished from Olympus for 9 years to serve as a shepherd to Admetus. With Apollo's help, Admetus completed the king's task, and was allowed to marry Alcestis. After the wedding, Admetus forgot to make the required sacrifice to Artemis, and found his bed full of snakes.
Apollo again helped the newly wed king, this time by making the Fates drunk, extracting from them a promise that if anyone would want to die instead of Admetus, they would allow it. Since no one volunteered, not even his elderly parents, Alcestis stepped forth. Shortly after, Heracles rescued Alcestis from Hades, as a token of appreciation for the hospitality of Admetus. Admetus and Alcestis had a son, Eumelus, a participant in the siege of Troy, and a daughter, Perimele.
Milton's famous sonnet, "Methought I Saw My Late Espoused Saint," alludes to the myth, with the speaker of the poem dreaming of his dead wife being brought to him "like Alcestis". In his poem "Past Ruin'd Ilion", English writer and poet Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) wrote the line "Alcestis rises from the shades" as having a double meaning, evoking her rise from Hades while demonstrating the ability of enduring poetry to give her vitality, drawing her into the light from the shadows of historical oblivion.
The Viennese composer Gluck wrote an opera based on the story of Alceste, as did Handel, in his opera. H.P. Lovecraft and Sonia Greene collaborated on a play called Alcestis (however, Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi thinks it is entirely Greene's work)."The Contributions within Lovecraft's Collaborations" Thornton Wilder wrote A Life in the Sun (1955) based on Euripides' play, later producing an operatic version called The Alcestiad (1962). The American choreographer Martha Graham created a ballet entitled Alcestis in 1960.
In the animated Disney film Hercules the background story of the Megara character also alludes to Alcestis. As Hades tells it, Megara sells her soul for her lover, who does not honor the sacrifice and very soon gives his heart to some other girl.

[[Pelias]]

CATEGORIES: Kings in Greek mythology, Offspring of Poseidon, Demigods of Classical mythology, Kings of Iolcus

Pelias (Ancient Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Πελίας[/tpl]) was king of Iolcus in Greek mythology, the son of Tyro and Poseidon. His wife is recorded as either Anaxibia, daughter of Bias, or Phylomache, daughter of Amphion. He was the father of Acastus, Pisidice, Alcestis, Pelopia, Hippothoe, Amphinome, Evadne, Asteropeia, and Antinoe.Greek Mythology Link (Carlos Parada) - Pelias 1
Tyro was married to Cretheus, with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Pherês, and Amythaon, but she loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus and from their union was born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain to die, but they were found by a herdsman who raised them as his own, as one story goes, or they were raised by a maid. When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found Tyro and killed her stepmother Sidero, for having mistreated her. Sidero hid in a temple to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, causing Hera's undying hatred of Pelias. Pelias was power-hungry and he wished to gain dominion over all of Thessaly. To this end, he banished Neleus and Pherês, and locked Aeson in the dungeons in Iolcus (by the modern city of Volos). While in the dungeons, Aeson married and had several children, most famously, Jason.  Aeson sent Jason away from Iolcus in fear that Pelias would kill him as an heir to the throne. Jason grew in the care of Chiron the centaur, on Mount Pelium, to be educated while Pelias, paranoid that he would be overthrown, was warned by an oracle to beware a man wearing one sandal."Jason"  The Oxford Companion to World mythology. David Leeming. Oxford University Press, 2004. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.  York University.  25 October 2011  
Many years later, Pelias was holding the Olympics and offered a sacrifice by the sea in honor of Poseidon. Jason, who was summoned with many others to take part in the sacrifice, lost one of his sandals in the flooded river Anaurus while rushing to Iolcus.  In Virgil's Aeneid, Hera had disguised herself as an old woman, whom Jason was helping across the river when he lost his sandal. When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Paranoid, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece.  Pelias took Jason's advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever-watchful dragon guarded it.Apollodorus The Library of Greek Mythology. Trans. Robin Hard. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1997. 48-49. Print.
Jason made preparations by commanding the shipwright Argus to build a ship large enough for fifty men, which he would eventually call the Argo. These heroes who would join his quest were known as the Argonauts. Upon their arrival Jason requested the Golden Fleece from the King of Colchis, Aeëtes. Aeëtes demanded that Jason must first yoke a pair of fire-breathing bulls to a plough and sew the dragon’s mouth shut. Medea, daughter of Aeëtes, fell in love with Jason, and being endowed with magical powers, aided him in his completion of the difficult task. She cast a spell to put the dragon to sleep, enabling Jason to obtain the Golden Fleece from the oak tree. Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts fled Colchis and began their return journey to Thessaly.Collier, P. F. "Jason." Collier's Encyclopedia. Ed. William D. Halsey and Emanuel Friedman. 1981. 504-05. Print.
During Jason's absence, Pelias thought the Argo had sunk, and this was what he told Aeson and Promachus, who committed suicide by drinking poison. However, it is unknown but possible that the two were both killed directly by Pelias.  When Jason and Medea returned, Pelias still refused to give up his throne.  Medea conspired to have Pelias' own daughters (Peliades) kill him.  She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it. During the demonstration, a live, young ram jumped out of the pot.  Excited, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw them in a pot, in the expectation that he would emerge rejuvenated. Pelias, of course, did not survive. As he was now an accessory to a terrible crime, Jason was still not made king. Pelias' son Acastus later drove Jason and Medea to Corinth and so reclaimed the kingdom. An alternate telling of the story has Medea slitting the throat of Jason's father Aeson, who she then really does revive as a much younger man; Pelias' daughters then slit their father's throat after she promises to do the same for him, and she merely breaks her word and leaves him dead.

Adonis([tpl]lang-grc-gre|Ἄδωνις[/tpl]), in Greek mythology, is the god of beauty and desire, and is a central figure in various mystery religions. His religion belonged to women: the dying of Adonis was fully developed in the circle of young girls around the poet Sappho from the island of Lesbos, about 600 BC, as revealed in a fragment of Sappho's surviving poetry.The standard modern survey and repertory of Adonis in Greek culture is W. Atallah, Adonis dans la littérature et l'art grecs, Paris, 1966.
Adonis has had multiple roles, and there has been much scholarship over the centuries concerning his meaning and purpose in Greek religious beliefs. He is an annually-renewed, ever-youthful vegetation god, a life-death-rebirth deity whose nature is tied to the calendar. His name is often applied in modern times to handsome youths, of whom he is the archetype.

It, and related species, are often called chats.
It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in mixed coniferous forest with undergrowth in northern Asia and northeastern Europe, from Finland east across Siberia to Kamchatka and south to Japan. It winters mainly in southeastern Asia, in the Indian Subcontinent, the Himalayas, Taiwan, and northern Indochina. The breeding range is slowly expanding westwards through Finland (where up to 500 pairs now breeding), and it is a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe, mainly to Great Britain.[tpl]cite book | last = Hoyo| first = J. del, et al., eds.| title = Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 10| publisher = Lynx Edicions| year = 2005 | location = Barcelona| pages = 754| isbn = 84-87334-72-5[/tpl]British Birds Rarities Committee occurrences, 1950-2006Hudson, N. et al.

At 13–14 cm long and 10–18 g weight, the Red-flanked Bluetail is similar in size and weight to the Common Redstart and slightly smaller (particularly with a slimmer build) than the European Robin. As the name implies, both sexes have a blue tail and rump, and orange-red flanks; they also have a white throat and greyish-white underparts, and a small, thin black bill and slender black legs. The adult male additionally has dark blue upperparts, while females and immature males are plain brown above apart from the blue rump and tail, and have a dusky breast. In behaviour, it is similar to a Common Redstart, frequently flicking its tail in the same manner, and regularly flying from a perch to catch insects in the air or on the ground. The male sings its melancholy trill from treetops. Its call is a typical chat "tacc" noise. The nest is built on or near the ground, with 3–5 eggs which are incubated by the female.Svensson, L., Mullarney, K., & Zetterström, D. (2009) Collins Bird Guide, ed. 2.

The Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), also known as the Sprosser, is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It, and similar small European species, are often called chats.
It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in forests in Europe and Asia and overwintering in Africa. The distribution is more northerly than the very closely related Common Nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos, which it closely resembles in appearance. It nests near the ground in dense undergrowth.
The Thrush Nightingale is similar in size to the European Robin. It is plain greyish-brown above and  white and greyish-brown below. Its greyer tones, giving a cloudy appearance to the underside, and lack of the Common Nightingale's obvious rufous tail side patches are the clearest plumage differences from that species. Sexes are similar. It has a similar but more powerful song than that of the Nightingale.

It is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in wet birch wood or bushy swamp in Europe and Asia with a foothold in western Alaska. It nests in tussocks or low in dense bushes. It winters in north Africa and the Indian Subcontinent.
The Bluethroat is similar in size to the European Robin at 13–14 cm. It is plain brown above except for the distinctive black tail with red side patches. It has a strong white supercilium.
The male has an iridescent blue bib edged below with successive black, white and rust coloured borders. Some races, such as L. svecica svecica (Red-spotted Bluethroat) of northern Eurasia, have a red spot in the centre of the blue bib.
Others, such as L. svecica cyanecula  (White-spotted Bluethroat) of southern and central Europe, have a white spot in the centre of the blue bib. L. svecica magna  in Turkey has no central spot.
Females of all races usually have just a blackish crescent on an otherwise cream throat and breast. Newly fledged juveniles are freckled and spotted dark brown above.

In its most general sense, the practice of law involves giving legal advice to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal negotiations and court proceedings such as lawsuits, and is applied to the professional services of a lawyer or attorney at law, barrister, solicitor, or civil law notary. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  agents. These professions include real estate, banking, accounting, and insurance. Moreover, a growing number of legal document assistants (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by computer-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions posed by the software in order to construct the legal documents.

Chartres Cathedral, also known as Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Chartres ([tpl]lang-fr|Basilique Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Chartres[/tpl]), is a medieval Roman Rite Catholic cathedral located in Chartres, France, about [tpl]convert|80|km[/tpl] southwest of Paris. It is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The current cathedral, mostly constructed between 1194 and 1250, is the last of at least five which have occupied the site since the town became a bishopric in the 4th century.
The cathedral is in an exceptional state of preservation. The majority of the original stained glass windows survive intact, while the architecture has seen only minor changes since the early 13th century. The building's exterior is dominated by heavy flying buttresses which allowed the architects to increase the window size significantly, while the west end is dominated by two contrasting spires – a 105-metre (349 ft) plain pyramid completed around 1160 and a 113-metre (377 ft) early 16th-century Flamboyant spire on top of an older tower. Equally notable are the three great façades, each adorned with hundreds of sculpted figures illustrating key theological themes and narratives.
Since at least the 12th century the cathedral has been an important destination for travellers – and remains so to this day, attracting large numbers of Christian pilgrims, many of whom come to venerate its famous relic, the Sancta Camisa, said to be the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary at Christ's birth, as well as large numbers of secular tourists who come to admire the cathedral's architecture and historical merit.

John Brown (May 9, 1800[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]December 2, 1859) was a white American abolitionist who believed armed insurrection was the only way to overthrow the institution of slavery in the United States.Territorial Kansas Online: John Brown (1800–1859) During the 1856 conflict in Kansas, Brown commanded forces at the Battle of Black Jack and the Battle of Osawatomie. Brown's followers also killed five slavery supporters at Pottawatomie. In 1859, Brown led an unsuccessful raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry that ended with his capture. Brown's trial resulted in his conviction and a sentence of death by hanging.
Brown's attempt in 1859 to start a liberation movement among enslaved African Americans in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, electrified the nation. He was tried for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men and inciting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. Southerners alleged that his rebellion was the tip of the abolitionist iceberg and represented the wishes of the Republican Party to end slavery. Historians agree that the Harpers Ferry raid in 1859 escalated tensions that, a year later, led to secession and the American Civil War.
Brown first gained attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the Bleeding Kansas crisis. Unlike most other Northerners, who advocated peaceful resistance to the pro-slavery faction, Brown believed that peaceful resistance was shown to be ineffective and that the only way to defeat the oppressive system of slavery was through violent insurrection. He believed he was the instrument of God's wrath in punishing men for the sin of owning slaves.[tpl]cite book|author=Eric Foner|title=Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=10NdBej1_JEC&pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=32|isbn=9780375702747[/tpl]
Dissatisfied with the pacifism encouraged by the organized abolitionist movement, he said, "These men are all talk. What we need is action—action!"[tpl]cite book |last=Rhodes |first=James Fork |title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 |year=1892 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=Original from Harvard University |page=385[/tpl] During the Kansas campaign, he and his supporters killed five pro-slavery southerners in what became known as the Pottawatomie Massacre in May 1856 in response to the raid on the "free soil" city of Lawrence, Kansas. In 1859 he led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry. During the raid, he seized the armory; seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. He intended to arm slaves with weapons from the arsenal, but the attack failed. Within 36 hours, Brown's men had fled or been killed or captured by local pro-slavery farmers, militiamen, and U.S. Marines led by Robert E. Lee. Brown's subsequent capture by federal forces seized the nation's attention, as Southerners feared it was just the first of many Northern plots to cause a slave rebellion that might endanger their lives, while Republicans dismissed the notion and said they would not interfere with slavery in the South.David S. Reynolds, John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights (2005) p. 6
Historians agree John Brown played a major role in the start of the Civil War. Historian David Potter has said the emotional effect of Brown's raid was greater than the philosophical effect of the Lincoln–Douglas debates, and that his raid revealed a deep division between North and South.David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pp. 356–84 Some writers, such as Bruce Olds, describe him as a monomaniacal zealot; others, such as Stephen B. Oates, regard him as "one of the most perceptive human beings of his generation." David S. Reynolds hails the man who "killed slavery, sparked the civil war, and seeded civil rights" and Richard Owen Boyer emphasizes that Brown was "an American who gave his life that millions of other Americans might be free."David S. Reynolds, John Brown, Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights (2005); Stephen Oates quoted at http://www.nps.gov/archive/hafe/jbrown/oates-text.htm The song "John Brown's Body" made him a heroic martyr and was a popular Union marching song during the Civil War.
Brown's actions prior to the Civil War as an abolitionist, and the tactics he chose, still make him a controversial figure today. He is sometimes memorialized as a heroic martyr and a visionary and sometimes vilified as a madman and a terrorist.Frederick J. Blue in American Historical Review (April 2006) v. 111 pp. 481–82. Historians debate whether he was "America's first domestic terrorist"; many historians believe the term "terrorist" is an inappropriate label to describe Brown.Ken Chowder, "The Father of American Terrorism," American Heritage, (February 2000) vol. 51#1 pp. 81–91  says "yes"; Paul Finkelman, "John Brown America's First Terrorist?"

The Chauci ([tpl]lang-de|Chauken[/tpl], and identical or similar in other regional modern languages) were an ancient Germanic tribe living in the low-lying region between the Rivers Ems and Elbe, on both sides of the Weser and ranging as far inland as the upper Weser. Along the coast they lived on artificial hills called terpen, built high enough to remain dry during the highest tide. A dense population of Chauci lived further inland, and they are presumed to have lived in a manner similar to the lives of the other Germanic peoples of the region.
Their ultimate origins are not well understood. In the Germanic pre-Migration Period (i.e., before c. 300 AD) the Chauci and the related Frisians, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=14[/tpl], Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood uses the term 'North German' to distinguish them from the 'Rhine Germans' (the Caninnefates, Batavians, and "Frankish" tribes). All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=17–19[/tpl], Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Todd's The Northern Barbarians 100 BC–AD 300 (1987) for this conclusion. The Chauci originally centered on the Weser and Elbe, but in c. AD 58 they expanded westward to the River Ems by expelling the neighboring Ampsivarii,[tpl]Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=253–254[/tpl], The Annals, Bk XIII, Ch 55. Events of AD 54–58. The Germans under Arminius had wiped out 3 Roman legions under Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The Ampsivarii had not supported the German cause and had been ostracised as a result. Many years later, c. AD 58, the Chauci then took the opportunity to expel them and occupy their land at the mouth of the River Ems.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=17–19[/tpl], Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Tacitus as well as a number of other sources. whereby they gained a border with the Frisians to the west. The Romans referred to the Chauci living between the Weser and Elbe as the 'Greater Chauci' and those living between the Ems and Weser as the 'Lesser Chauci'.[tpl]Harvcolnb|Tacitus|117|pp=355[/tpl], The Annals, Translator's note on Bk XI, Ch 19.
The Chauci entered the historical record in descriptions of them by classical Roman sources late in the 1st century BC in the context of Roman military campaigns and sea raiding. For the next 200 years the Chauci provided Roman auxiliaries through treaty obligations, but they also appear in their own right in concert with other Germanic tribes, opposing the Romans. Accounts of wars therefore mention the Chauci on both sides of the conflict, though the actions of troops under treaty obligation were separate from the policies of the tribe.
The Chauci lost their separate identity in the 3rd century when they merged with the Saxons,[tpl]Harvcolnb|Haywood|1999|pp=28[/tpl], Dark Age Naval Power. after which time they were considered to be Saxons. The circumstances of the merger are an unsettled issue of scholarly research.

[[Cherusci]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Germanic peoples

The Cherusci were a Germanic tribe that inhabited parts of the plains and forests of northwestern Germany, in the area possibly near present-day Hanover, during the 1st century BC and 1st century AD. Ethnically, Pliny the Elder groups them with their neighbours the Suebi and Chatti, as well as the Hermunduri, as Hermiones, one of the Germanic groupings said to descend from an ancestor named Mannus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=4:chapter=28&highlight=cherusci |title=Plin.

[[Domestic long-haired cat]]

CATEGORIES: Cat landraces

A domestic long-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry – thus not belonging to any particular recognised cat breed – possessing a coat of semi-long to long fur.[tpl]cite video | url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/cats-101/videos/domestic-longhair.htm | title=Domestic Longhair | publisher=Animal Planet | medium=Video | series=Cats 101[/tpl] Says 10% are long-haired. Domestic long-haired cats should not be confused with the British Longhair, American Longhair, or other breeds with "Longhair" names, which are formal breeds recognised by various registries. Domestic long-haireds are the second most popular cat in the United States after the domestic short-haired; one in ten of the ninety million cats in America is a domestic long-hair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.americanhumane.org/assets/pdfs/pets-fact-sheet.pdf |title=U.S. Pet (Dog & Cat) Population Factsheet |year=2012 |publisher=American Humane Association (AHA) |accessdate=2013-12-17[/tpl] Gives a figure of 95% short-haired.  Other generic terms are long-haired house cat and, in British English, long-haired moggie.

While not bred as show cats, some mixed-breed cats are actually pedigreed and entered into cat shows that have non-purebred "Household Pet" divisions.  Show rules vary, and may permit "any eye colour, all coat colours and patterns, any coat length or texture, and any length of tail" (i.e. anything at all, as long as the cat is well-proportioned and healthy) or may be more restrictive, e.g.: "The colours chocolate and cinnamon, as well as their dilution (lilac and fawn) are not recognized in any combinations...the pointed pattern is also not recognized".
Domestic long-haireds come in all genetically possible cat colours including tabby, tortoiseshell, bi-coloured, and smoke. Domestic long-haireds can have fur that is up to six inches long. They can also have a mane similar to a Maine Coon's, as well as toe tufts and ear tufts. Some long-haired cats are not able to maintain their own coat, which must be frequently groomed by a human or may be prone to matting. Because of their wide gene pool, domestic long-haireds are not predisposed to any genetically inherited problems.

Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards, (c. 570-628) was the daughter of duke Garibald I of Bavaria.[tpl]cite web|last=Herbermann, Charles, ed.|title=Lombardy|work=Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=29 July 2013|year=1913[/tpl] 
She was married first in 589 to Authari, king of the Lombards, son of king Cleph. Authari died in 590. Theodelinda was allowed to pick Agilulf as her next husband and Authari's successor in 591. She thereafter exerted much influence in restoring Nicene Christianity (the mainstream, later split in 1054 by the East-West Schism in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy) to a position of primacy in Italy against its rival, Arian Christianity. 
After the conversion of Agilulf to the Catholic faith, she started building churches in Lombardy and Tuscany, among them the cathedral of Monza and the first Baptistery of Florence. They were all dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.
The famous treasure of Monza contains the Iron Crown of Lombardy and the theca persica, enclosing a text from the Gospel of John, sent by Pope Gregory I (590-604) to her for her son Adaloald. Another of the gifts of this pope to the Lombard queen was a cruciform encolpion (reliquary) containing a portion of the True Cross.

Louis Philippe I (6 October 1773 – 26 August 1850) was King of the French from 1830 to 1848 in what was known as the July Monarchy. His father was a duke who supported the Revolution of 1789 but was nevertheless guillotined during the Reign of Terror. Louis Philippe fled France as a young man and spent 21 years in exile. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after Charles X was forced to abdicate. Louis Philippe himself was forced to abdicate in 1848 and lived out his life in exile in the United Kingdom. Before he fled France in 1793, he led troops in the early battles of the French Revolutionary Wars as the Duke of Chartres; therefore CHARTRES is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, the first name in Column 1.

[[Shellsort]]

CATEGORIES: Sorting algorithms, Comparison sorts

Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can either be seen as a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting elements far apart from each other and progressively reducing the gap between them. Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959.[ref]
</ref><ref>Some older textbooks and references call this the "Shell-Metzner" sort after [[Marlene Metzner Norton]], but according to Metzner, "I had nothing to do with the sort, and my name should never have been attached to it." See 
</ref> The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants, determining their [[time complexity]] remains an [[open problem]].

Besides the Pyrenean Kingdom of Navarre, he had extensive lands in Normandy, inherited from his father, Count Philip of Évreux, and his mother, Queen Joan II of Navarre, who had received them as compensation for resigning her claims to France, Champagne, and Brie in 1328. Thus, in Northern France, Charles possessed Évreux, Mortain, parts of Vexin, and a portion of Cotentin. He was a major player at a critical juncture in the Hundred Years' War between France and England, allying alternately with both powers and repeatedly switching sides in order to further his own agenda.

In computing, a serial port is a serial communication physical  interface  through which information  transfers in or out one bit at a time (in contrast to a parallel port).[tpl]cite web|author=Webopedia |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/serial_port.html |title=What is serial port? - A Word Definition From the Webopedia Computer Dictionary |publisher=Webopedia.com |date=2003-09-03 |accessdate=2009-08-07[/tpl] Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data was transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals and various peripherals.
While such interfaces as  Ethernet, FireWire, and USB all send data as a serial stream, the term "serial port" usually identifies hardware more or less compliant to the RS-232 standard, intended to interface with a modem or with a similar communication device.
Modern computers without serial ports may require serial-to-USB converters to allow compatibility with RS 232 serial devices. Serial ports are still used in applications such as industrial automation systems, scientific instruments,  shop till systems and some industrial and consumer products. Server computers may use a serial port as a control console for diagnostics. Network equipment (such as routers and switches) often use serial console for configuration. Serial ports are still used in these areas as they are simple, cheap and their console functions are highly standardized and widespread. A serial port requires very little supporting software from the host system.

Oedipus ([tpl]IPAc-en|us|ˈ|ɛ|d|ɨ|p|ə|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|iː|d|ɨ|p|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Οἰδίπους[/tpl] Oidípous meaning "swollen foot") was a mythical Greek king of Thebes. A tragic hero in Greek mythology, Oedipus fulfilled a prophecy that said he would kill his father, and thereby bring disaster on his city and family. The story of Oedipus is the subject of Sophocles's tragedy Oedipus the King, which was followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone. Together, these plays make up Sophocles's three Theban plays. Oedipus represents two enduring themes of Greek myth and drama: the flawed nature of humanity and an individual's role in the course of destiny in a harsh universe.
Oedipus was born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta. In the most well-known version of the myth, Laius wished to thwart a prophecy, which said that his child would grow up to murder his father and marry his mother. Thus, he fastened the infant's feet together with a large pin and left him to die on a mountainside. The baby was found on Kithairon by shepherds and raised by King Polybus and Queen Merope in the city of Corinth. Oedipus learned from the oracle at Delphi of the prophecy, but believing he was fated to murder Polybus and marry Merope, he left Corinth. Heading to Thebes, Oedipus met an older man in a chariot coming the other way on a narrow road. The two quarreled over who should give way, which resulted in Oedipus killing the stranger and continuing on to Thebes. He found that the king of the city (Laius) had been recently killed and that the city was at the mercy of the Sphinx. Oedipus answered the monster's riddle correctly, defeating it and winning the throne of the dead king and the hand in marriage of the king's widow, his mother, Jocasta.
Oedipus and Jocasta had two sons (Eteocles and Polynices) and two daughters (Antigone and Ismene). In his search to determine who killed Laius (and thus end a plague on Thebes), Oedipus discovered it was he who had killed the late king (his father). Jocasta, upon realizing that she had married her own son and Laius's murderer, hanged herself. Oedipus then seized two pins from her dress and blinded himself with them. Oedipus was driven into exile, accompanied by Antigone and Ismene. After years of wandering, he arrived in Athens, where he found refuge in a grove of trees called Colonus. By this time, warring factions in Thebes wished him to return to that city, believing that his body would bring it luck. However, Oedipus died at Colonus, and the presence of his grave there was said to bring good fortune to Athens.
The legend of Oedipus has been retold in many versions, and was used by Sigmund Freud to name and give mythic precedent to the Oedipus complex.

The Thuringii or Toringi were a Germanic tribe which appeared late during the Völkerwanderung in the Harz Mountains of central Germania around 280, in a region which still bears their name to this day — Thuringia. They evidently filled a void left when the previous inhabitants — the Alamanni — migrated south to the region named after them, Alemannia. They may have been remnants of the Alemannic confederation, or simply another lesser tribe. Some have suggested that they were the remnants of the Hermanduri, that last part of whose name (-duri) was corrupted (-thuri) and afterwards suffixed with -ing, meaning "descendants of (the Hermanduri)".Schutz, 402. Claudius Ptolemy mentions neither tribe in his geography but instead the Teuriochaemae, who may also be connected to later Thuringians.

[[Oratory of the Paraclete]]

The Oratory of the Paraclete was a Benedictine monastery founded by Peter Abelard in Ferreux-Quincey, France, after he left the Abbey of St. Denis about 1121.  However, nothing remains of the Oratory.
In 1125 he was elected by the monks of the Abbey at Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, near Vannes, Brittany, to be their abbot, so he turned the Paraclete over to Heloise, his wife, who had been in a convent in Argenteuil since taking the veil.  She became the Paraclete's abbess and spent the rest of her life there. She and Abelard were buried together there from 1142 (when Abelard was buried, then Heloise when she died in 1164) to 1792, when their remains were transferred to the church of Nogent-sur-Seine nearby.  In 1817, their bodies were reportedly moved to a new tomb at Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, but whether they are both actually buried there remains a matter of dispute.
Paraclete comes from the Greek word meaning "one who consoles" and is found in the Gospel of John (16:7) as a name for the Holy Spirit.

Admiralty law (also referred to as maritime law) is a distinct body of law which governs maritime questions and offenses. It is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, marine navigation, marine salvaging, shipping, sailors, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. Admiralty law also covers many commercial activities, although land based or occurring wholly on land, that are maritime in character.
Admiralty law is distinguished from the Law of the Sea,  which is a body of public international law dealing with navigational rights, mineral rights, jurisdiction over coastal waters and international law governing relationships between nations.
Although each legal jurisdiction usually has its own enacted legislation governing maritime matters, admiralty law is characterized by a significant amount of international law developed in recent decades, including numerous multilateral treaties.

[[Aëdon]]
CATEGORIES: Metamorphoses in Greek mythology, Women in Greek mythology

Aëdon ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀηδών[/tpl]) is, in Greek mythology, the daughter of Pandareus of Ephesus.  According to Homer she was the wife of Zethus, and the mother of Itylus.Homer, Odyssey xix. 517, &c.
Envious of Niobe, the wife of her husband's brother Amphion, who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus.  Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.Bibliotheca iii. 5. § 5
According to a later tradition preserved in Antoninus Liberalis,Antoninus Liberalis, c. 11 Aëdon is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of Colophon.  The couple boasted that they loved each other more than Hera and Zeus.  Hera sent Eris to cause trouble between the two of them.  Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of embroidery, and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize.  Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera's help) won.  He went to Aëdon's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him.  On his way home he raped her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize.  After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge.  They murdered Polytechnos' son Itys and served him up as a meal to his father.
Aëdon then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects.  Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a pelican, the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a swallow, and Aëdon herself into a nightingale.  This myth seems to have originated in mere etymologies, and is of the same class as that about Philomela and Procne.[ref]

Charles VI (3 December 1368 – 21 October 1422), called the Beloved ([tpl]lang-fr|le Bien-Aimé[/tpl]) and the Mad ([tpl]lang-fr|le Fol[/tpl] or le Fou), was King of France from 1380 to his death. He was a member of the House of Valois.
Charles VI was only 11 when he inherited the throne in the midst of the Hundred Years' War. The government was entrusted to his four uncles: Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; Louis I, Duke of Anjou; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Although the royal age of majority was fixed at 14 (the "age of accountability" under Roman Catholic canon law), the dukes maintained their grip on Charles until he took power at the age of 21.
During the rule of his uncles, the financial resources of the kingdom, painstakingly built up by his father Charles V, were squandered for the personal profit of the dukes, whose interests were frequently divergent or even opposing. As royal funds drained, new taxes had to be raised, which caused several revolts.
In 1388 Charles VI dismissed his uncles and brought back to power his father's former advisers, known as the Marmousets. Political and economic conditions in the kingdom improved significantly, and Charles earned the epithet "the Beloved". But in August 1392 en route to Brittany with his army in the forest of Le Mans, Charles suddenly went mad and slew four knights and almost killed his brother, Louis of Orléans.http://madmonarchs.guusbeltman.nl/madmonarchs/charles6/charles6_bio.htm
From then on, Charles' bouts of insanity became more frequent and of longer duration. During these attacks, he had delusions, believing he was made of glass or denying he had a wife and children. He could also attack servants or ran until exhaustion, wailing that he was threatened by his enemies. Between crises, there were intervals of months during which Charles was relatively sane. However, unable to concentrate or make decisions, political power was taken away from him by the princes of the blood, which would cause much chaos and conflict in France.
A fierce struggle for power developed between Louis of Orléans, the king's brother, and John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, the son of Philip the Bold. When John instigated the murder of Louis in November 1407, the conflict degenerated into a civil war between the Armagnacs (supporters of the House of Valois) and the Burgundians. John offered large parts of France to king Henry V of England, who was still at war with the Valois monarchy, in exchange for his support. After the assassination of John the Fearless, his son Philip the Good led Charles the Mad to sign the infamous Treaty of Troyes (1420), which recognized Henry V as his legitimate successor on the throne of France and disinherited his own offspring.
When Charles VI died, he was succeeded by his son Charles VII, who found the Valois cause in a desperate situation.

See Lambert, p. 19, and elsewhere.) was a  Bithynian Greek youth and a favourite of the Roman emperor Hadrian.Birley, p. 144 He was divinized after his death, being worshiped in both the Greek East and Latin West, sometimes as a god (theos) and sometimes merely as a divinized mortal (heros).Renberg, Gil H.:  Hadrian and the Oracles of Antinous (SHA, Hadr. 14.7); with an appendix on the so-called Antinoeion at Hadrian’s Villa and Rome’s Monte Pincio Obelisk, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 55 (2010) 2011, 159-198; Jones, Christopher P., New Heroes in Antiquity:  From Achilles to Antinoos (Cambridge, Mass. & London, 2010), 75-83; Bendlin, Andreas: Associations, Funerals, Sociality, and Roman Law:  The collegium of Diana and Antinous in Lanuvium (CIL 14.2112) Reconsidered, in M.

Little is known of Antinous' life, although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis, in the Roman province of Bithynia. He likely was introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to Italy for a higher education. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the Empire as part of Hadrian's personal retinue.

[[Aeëtes]]

CATEGORIES: Mythological kings of Colchis, Offspring of Helios, Fictional people from Georgia (country)

In Greek mythology, Aeëtes ([tpl]IPAc-en|iː|ˈ|iː|t|iː|z[/tpl]; also spelled Æëtes) (
, [tpl]lang-ka|აიეტი[/tpl] Aieti), was a King of Colchis, son of the sun-god Helios and the Oceanid Perseis (a daughter of Oceanus), brother of Circe and Pasiphaë, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. His consorts were Eidyia and either Asterodia the Oceanid, Neaera the Nereid. According to others, he was brother of Perses, a king of Tauris, husband of his niece Hecate, and father of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus. Yet other versions make Aeëtes a native of Corinth and son of Ephyra, or else of a certain Antiope.
Pausanias states that, according to the poet Eumelos, Aeëtes was the son of Helios (from northern Peloponnesus) and brother of Aloeus. Helios divided the land he ruled, and he gave Aloeus the part in Asopia (see Asopus) and Aeëtes the part of Ephyra (Corinthos). Later, Aeëtes gave his kingdom to Bounos, a son of Hermes and Alkidameia, and went to Colchis, a country in western Caucasus. When Bounos died, Epopeus, a son of Aloeus who ruled in Asopia, became king of Ephyra too. Aeëtes built a new colony in Colchis, near the mouth of the large river Phasis, and called it Aea. 
Phrixus, son of Athamus ( Prometheus > Deucalion > Hellen > Aeolus ( not the Aloeus cited above ) > Athamus > Phrixus ), and Nephele, along with his twin, Helle, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Before he was killed, though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where Aeëtes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung on a tree in his kingdom.
Some time later, Jason ( Prometheus > Deucalion > Hellen > Aeolus > Cretheus > Aeson > Jason ) arrived to claim the fleece as his own. Aeëtes promised to give it to him only if he could perform certain tasks. First, Jason had to plow a field with fire-breathing oxen that he had to yoke himself. Then, Jason sowed the teeth of a dragon into a field. The teeth sprouted into an army of warriors. Jason was quick-thinking, however, and before they attacked him, he threw a rock into the crowd. Unable to determine whence the rock had come, the soldiers attacked and killed each other. Finally, Aeëtes made Jason fight and kill the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece. Jason then took the fleece and sailed away with Aeëtes's daughter Medea, who had fallen in love with him and had done much to help him win the fleece. Aeëtes pursued them in his own ship as they fled, but Medea distracted her father by killing and dismembering her brother, Absyrtus, and throwing pieces of his cadaver overboard. Aeëtes paused to gather the pieces of his son, and thus  Jason and Medea escaped.

[[Phrixus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Boeotian mythology

In Greek mythology (also spelt Phrixus, Phryxus or Frixos; [tpl]lang-el|Φρίξος[/tpl], Phrixos; Georgian ფრიქსე Prikse) was the son of Athamas, king of Boiotia, and Nephele (a goddess of clouds). His twin sister Helle and he were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all of Boeotia's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus and Helle. Before they were killed, though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying, or swimming,Flying is conventional in modern treatments, but see D. S. Robertson,"The Flight of Phrixus", The Classical Review, Vol. 54, No. 1 (Mar., 1940), pp. 1-8. ram with golden wool sent by Nephele, their natural mother; their starting point is variously recorded as Halos in Thessaly and Orchomenus in Boeotia. During their flight Helle swooned, fell off the ram and drowned in the Dardanelles, renamed the Hellespont (sea of Helle), but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeëtes, the son of the sun god Helios, took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung in a tree in the holy grove of Ares in his kingdom, guarded by a dragon that never slept.
Phrixus and Chalciope had four sons, who later joined forces with the Argonauts. The oldest was Argos/Argus, Phrontis, Melas, and Cytisorus.

Oklahoma! is the first musical written by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II.  The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs.  Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of cowboy Curly McLain and his romance with farm girl Laurey Williams.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancée, Ado Annie.
The original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Academy Award-winning 1955 film adaptation.  It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions.Time magazine reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that Oklahoma! tied (with Bye Bye Birdie) as the eighth most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.  Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for Oklahoma! in 1944.
This musical, building on the innovations of the earlier Show Boat, epitomized the development of the "book musical", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.Everett, p. 137, chapter by Riis, Thomas L., with Ann Sears and Everett  In addition, Oklahoma! features musical themes, or motifs, that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story.Wilk, Max.

Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈdjeɣo roˈðɾiɣeð ðe ˈsilβa i βeˈlaθkeθ[/tpl]; baptized June 6, 1599 – August 6, 1660) was a Spanish painter who was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece Las Meninas (1656).
From the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Velázquez's artwork was a model for the realist and impressionist painters, in particular Édouard Manet. Since that time, famous modern artists, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon, have paid tribute to Velázquez by recreating several of his most famous works.

[[Athamas]]
CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Mythological kings, Boeotian mythology, Thessalian mythology, Aeolides

In Greek mythology, Athamas ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|əm|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἀθάμας[/tpl]) was a Boeotian king.Ps.-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.9.1. He was a son of Aeolus and Enarete,Hesiod, Catalogue of Women fr. 10(a)25–6; cf. Apld. 1.7.3. and sired several children by his first wife, the goddess Nephele, and his other wives Ino and Themisto.Apld. 1.9.1–2. Nephele first bore to him the twins Phrixus and Helle.Apld. 1.9.1. He subsequently married Ino, daughter of Cadmus, with whom, he had two children: Learches and Melicertes.Apld. 1.9.1.
Phrixus and Helle were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. Before he was killed, though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeëtes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeëtes hung in a tree in his kingdom.Ovid IV, 416. 
Later, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele, causing Hera's intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck Athamas with insanity. Athamas went mad and slew one of his sons, Learchus; Ino, to escape the pursuit of her frenzied husband, threw herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea, Melicertes as Palaemon. 
Athamas, with the guilt of his son's murder upon him, was obliged to flee from Boeotia. He was ordered by the oracle to settle in a place where he should receive hospitality from wild beasts. This he found at Phthiotis in Thessaly, where he surprised some wolves eating sheep; on his approach they fled, leaving him the bones. Athamas, regarding this as the fulfilment of the oracle, settled there and married a third wife, Themisto (sons: Schoeneus, Leucon, Ptous and/or others). The spot was afterwards called the Athamanian plain. When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black. Ino switched their clothes without Themisto's knowledge, and she killed her own children. 
According to some accounts, Athamas was succeeded on the throne by Presbon.Presbon A part of Kingdom of Athamas, and himself, moved west north and took roots in a part of Pindus mountains in Epirus, called Athamanean mountains. So this population today is called Athamaneans.Harry Gouvas: "History of Epirus", ed. 2009

[[Hypertension]]

CATEGORIES: Hypertension, Blood pressure, Medical conditions related to obesity, Aging-associated diseases

Hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure, sometimes called arterial hypertension, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. Blood pressure is summarised by two measurements, systolic and diastolic, which depend on whether the heart muscle is contracting (systole) or relaxed between beats (diastole). This equals the maximum and minimum pressure, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140mmHg systolic (top reading) and 60–90mmHg diastolic (bottom reading). High blood pressure is said to be present if it is often at or above 140/90 mmHg.
Hypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; about 90–95% of cases are categorized as "primary hypertension" which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical cause.[tpl]cite journal |author=Carretero OA, Oparil S |title=Essential hypertension. Part I: definition and etiology |journal=Circulation |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=329–35 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10645931 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/3/329.long |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.101.3.329[/tpl] The remaining 5–10% of cases (secondary hypertension) are caused by other conditions that affect the kidneys, arteries, heart or endocrine system.
Hypertension puts strain on the heart, leading to hypertensive heart disease and coronary artery disease if not treated. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for stroke, aneurysms of the arteries (e.g. aortic aneurysm), peripheral arterial disease and is a cause of chronic kidney disease. A moderately high arterial blood pressure is associated with a shortened life expectancy while mild elevation is not. Dietary and lifestyle changes can improve blood pressure control and decrease the risk of health complications, although drug treatment is still often necessary in people for whom lifestyle changes are not enough or not effective.

Nicomedes II Epiphanes (Greek: Νικομήδης Β' ὁ Ἐπιφανής) was the king of Bithynia from 149 to c. 127 BC. He was fourth in descent from Nicomedes I. Nicomedes II was the son and successor of Prusias II and Apame IV. His parents were related as they were cousins.
He was so popular with the people that his father sent him to Rome to limit his influence. However in Rome, he also gained favor from the Roman Senate, forcing Prusias to send an emissary with secret orders to assassinate him. But the emissary revealed the plot, and persuaded the prince to rebel against his father.
Supported by Attalus II Philadelphus, king of Pergamon, he was completely successful, and ordered his father to be put to death at Nicomedia. During his long reign Nicomedes adhered steadily to the Roman alliance, and assisted them against  the pretender to the throne of Pergamon Eumenes III. He was succeeded by his son Nicomedes III.

In Greek mythology, Nephele ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|f|ə|ˌ|l|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Νεφέλη[/tpl], from νέφος nephos "cloud"; Latinized to Nubes) was a cloud nymph who figured prominently in the story of Phrixus and Helle.Hyginus (Mary Grant translation): The Ram, (Aries)
Greek myth also has it that Nephele is the cloud whom Zeus created in the image of Hera to trick Ixion to test his integrity after displaying his lust for Hera during a feast as a guest of Zeus. Ixion failed in restraining his lust for Hera, thus fathering the Centaurs.
Nephele married Athamas, but he divorced her for Ino. Phrixus and Helle, the son and daughter of Athamas and Nephele, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance.

Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. 
Phrixus and Helle were instructed to not look down to Earth for the duration of their flight. Helle, though, did look down, and fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her, meaning Sea of Helle) and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the Golden Fleece of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom. The Golden Fleece would later be taken by Jason.

[[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]]

CATEGORIES: 74 BC deaths, 1st-century BC Asian rulers, Year of birth unknown

Nicomedes IV Philopator was the king of Bithynia from c. 94 BC to 74 BC. He was the first son and successor of the Monarchs Nicomedes III of Bithynia and NysaMcGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p. 143 and had a sister called Nysa.http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2326.html 
There is nothing known about Nicomedes IV's birth or the years before he became king. However, his reign began at the death of his father. The first few years of his kingship were relatively peaceful, but soon King Mithridates VI of Pontus (the maternal grand-uncle of Nicomedes IV), one of Rome's greatest enemies during the late Republic, began harassing Bithynia's borders.
Nicomedes IV's brother, Socrates Chrestus, assisted by Mithridates VI, defeated Nicomedes IV's army in 90 BC, and Nicomedes IV was forced to flee to Italy. He was restored to his throne due to Rome's influence in the region.Smith p. 1197 However, the Roman Senate encouraged Nicomedes IV to raid Mithridates VI's territory, and Mithridates VI struck once again in 88 BC. Nicomedes IV fled once again to Rome.
The East was seen by the Romans as a province providing an abundance  of gold and silver. As such, two powerful Romans, Gaius Marius and the Consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla aimed at command in the region. Sulla fled the intrigues of Rome to Anatolia, where he commenced the First Mithridatic War. Sulla fought Mithridates VI on several occasions over the next three years, and finally in 85 BC, Mithridates VI sued for peace, and was allowed to retain his kingship in Pontus after paying a heavy fine.
Nicomedes IV was restored to his throne in Bithynia in 84 BC. The years that followed were relatively peaceful, though Bithynia came more and more under the control of Rome. In 80 BC, young Gaius Julius Caesar was an ambassador to Nicomedes IV's court. Caesar was sent to raise a fleet using Bithynia's resources, but he dallied so long with the King that a rumor of a homosexual relationship surfaced, leading to the disparaging title, "the Queen of Bithynia", an allegation which was made much use of by Caesar's political enemies later in his life.Suetonius  ii., 45-53
As one of his last acts as king of Bithynia, in 74 BC, Nicomedes IV bequeathed the entire kingdom of Bithynia to Rome. The Roman Senate quickly voted it as a new province. Rome's old enemy Mithridates VI had other plans for Bithynia, however, and Nicomedes IV's death and bequeathal led directly to the Third Mithridatic War.

[[Ino (Greek mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Queens in Greek mythology, Theban mythology

In Greek mythology Ino ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|oʊ|[/tpl] [tpl]lang-el|Ἰνώ[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-el|iːnɔ̌ː|a[/tpl]Henry George Liddell. Robert Scott. A Greek-English Lexicon) was a mortal queen of Thebes, who after her death and transfiguration was worshiped as a goddess under her epithet Leucothea, the "white goddess." Alcman called her "Queen of the Sea" (θαλασσομέδουσα),Alcman, fragment 83. which, if not hyperbole, would make her a doublet of Amphitrite.
In her mortal self, Ino, the second wife of the Minyan king Athamas, the mother of Learches and Melicertes, daughter of Cadmus and HarmoniaHesiod, who calls her only Ino, lists her among the "glorious offspring" of unions between a mortal and a goddess (Theogony. 975f). and stepmother of Phrixus and Helle, was one of the three sisters of Semele, the mortal woman of the house of Cadmus who gave birth to Dionysus. The three sisters were Agave, Autonoë and Ino, who was a surrogate for the divine nurses of Dionysus:  "Ino was a primordial Dionysian woman, nurse to the god and a divine maenad" (Kerenyi 1976:246).
Maenads were reputed to tear their own children limb from limb in their madness. In the back-story to the heroic tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece, Phrixus and Helle, twin children of Athamas and Nephele, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the crop seeds of Boeotia so they would not grow.Bibliotheke i.9.1; "it is possible, however", Kerenyi suggests (The Gods of the Greeks p 264) "that originally she did not cause the seed-corn to be roasted, but introduced the practice of roasting corn in general." The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her, meaning Sea of Helle) and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom. 
Later, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele,Local tradition sited the suckling of Dionysus at Brasiai in Laconia. (Kerenyi 1951:264). causing Hera's intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck Athamas with insanity. Athamas went mad, slew one of his sons, Learchus, thinking he was a ram, and set out in frenzied pursuit of Ino. To escape him Ino threw herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea ("the white goddess"), Melicertes as Palaemon.  Alternatively, Ino was also stricken with insanity and killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron, then took the cauldron and jumped into the sea with it.  A sympathetic Zeus did not want Ino to die,   and transfigured her and Melicertes as Leucothea and Palaemon.
The story of Ino, Athamas and Melicertes is relevant also in the context of two larger themes.  Ino, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, had an end just as tragic as her siblings: Semele died while pregnant with Zeus' child, killed by her own pride and lack of trust in her lover; Agave killed her own son, King Pentheus, while struck with Dionysian madness, and Actaeon, son of Autonoe, the third sibling, was torn apart by his own hunting dogs.  Also, the insanity of Ino and Athamas, who hunted his own son Learchos as a stag and slew him, can be explained as a result of their contact with Dionysus, whose presence can cause insanity.  None can escape the powers of Dionysus, the god of wine. Euripides took up the tale in The Bacchae, explaining their madness in Dionysiac terms, as a result of their having initially resisted belief in the god's divinity.
When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto (his third wife) sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black and directing the murder of the children in black.  Ino switched their clothes without Themisto knowing and she killed her own children.
Transformed into the goddess Leucothea, Ino also represents one of the many sources of divine aid to Odysseus in the Odyssey (5:333ff), her earliest appearance in literature. Homer calls her "Ino-Leocothea of the beautiful ankles καλλίσφυρος, daughter of Cadmus, who was once a mortal speaking with the tongue of men, but now in the salt sea-waters has received honor at the hands of the gods". Providing Odysseus with a veil and telling him to discard his cloak and raft, she instructs him how he can entrust himself to the waves and succeed in reaching land and eventually the island of Scheria (Corcyra), home of Phaeaceans.
In historical times, a sisterhood of maenads of Thebes in the service of Dionysus traced their descent in the female line from Ino; we know this because an inscription at Magnesia on the Maeander summoned three maenads from Thebes, from the house of Ino, to direct the new mysteries of Dionysus at Magnesia (Burkert 1992:44).

[[Commercial law]]

CATEGORIES: Business law

Commercial law, also known as business law, is the body of law that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of persons and businesses engaged in commerce, merchandising, trade, and sales.[tpl]cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012[/tpl] It is often considered to be a branch of civil law and deals with issues of both private law and public law.
Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; merchant shipping; guarantee; marine, fire, life, and accident insurance; bills of exchange and partnership. It can also be understood to regulate corporate contracts, hiring practices, and the manufacture and sales of consumer goods. Many countries have adopted civil codes that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law. 
In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the United States Congress, under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.
Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly vis-a-vis employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Act in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

[[Zuid-Willemsvaart]]

CATEGORIES: Canals in the Netherlands

The Zuid-Willemsvaart zœytˈʋɪləmsfaːrt ("South Willem's Canal") is a canal in the southern Netherlands, providing a shortcut in river Meuse between the cities of Maastricht and 's-Hertogenbosch. The canal was named after King William I of the Netherlands, with "South" added to avoid confusion with two other canals commissioned by and named after the King: the Willemsvaart near Zwolle and the Noord-Willemskanaal in the province of Groningen.
King William ordered the planning of the canal, and construction started in 1823. The canal was completed in 1826 and named for the king. The 123 km-long canal runs through the Belgian province of Limburg, the Dutch province of Limburg and, for the largest part, through the Dutch province of North Brabant. At the time of the canal's construction, all of these regions were part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830/39).
The canal created new possibilities for development of the poor towns on the sandy grounds of North Brabant, such as Helmond and Veghel and created an alternative traderoute for ships that did not want to sail the Meuse.
Nowadays the channel is being enlarged to make more room for ships with higher tonnage and therefore the development of larger industries.

[[Leucothea]]
CATEGORIES: Greek goddesses, Metamorphoses in Greek mythology, Nereids, Sea and river goddesses, Characters in the Odyssey

In Greek mythology, Leucothea ([tpl]lang-el|Leukothea[/tpl] (Λευκοθέα),  "white goddess") was one of the aspects under which an ancient sea goddess was recognized, in this case as a transformed nymph.
In the more familiar variant, Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, sister of Semele, and queen of Athamas, became a goddess  after Hera drove her insane as a punishment for caring for the newborn Dionysus. She leapt into the sea with her son Melicertes in her arms, and out of pity, the Hellenes asserted, the Olympian gods turned them both into sea-gods, transforming Melicertes into Palaemon, the patron of the Isthmian games, and Ino into Leucothea.
In the version sited at Rhodes, a much earlier mythic level is reflected in the genealogy: there, the woman who plunged into the sea and became Leucothea was Halia ("of the sea", a personification of the saltiness of the sea) whose parents were from the ancient generation, Thalassa and Pontus or Uranus. She was a local nymph and one of the aboriginal Telchines of the island. Halia became Poseidon's wife and bore him Rhodos/Rhode and six sons; the sons were maddened by Aphrodite in retaliation for an impious affront, assaulted their sister and were confined beneath the Earth by Poseidon. Thus the Rhodians traced their mythic descent from Rhode and the Sun god Helios.Graves 1955.
In the Odyssey (5.333 ff.) Leucothea makes a dramatic appearance as a gannet who tells the shipwrecked Odysseus to discard his cloak and raft and offers him a veil (κρήδεμνον, kredemnon) to wind round himself to save his life and reach land. Homer makes her the transfiguration of Ino. In Laconia, she has a sanctuary, where she answers people's questions about dreams. This is her form of the oracle.

Charles V (21 January 1338 – 16 September 1380), called the Wise (French : "le Sage"), was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 1364 to his death.
In 1349, as a young prince, Charles received from his grandfather King Philip VI the province of Dauphiné to rule. This allowed him to bear the title "Dauphin" until his coronation, which saw the integration of the Dauphiné into the crown lands of France. From this date, all heirs apparent of France bore the title of Dauphin until their coronation.
Charles became regent of France when his father John II was captured by the English at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. To pay the ransom, Charles had to raise taxes and deal with the hostility of the nobility, led by Charles the Bad, King of Navarre; the opposition of the French bourgeoisie, which was channeled through the Estates-General led by Etienne Marcel; and with peasant revolts known as Jacqueries. Charles overcame all of these rebellions, but in order to liberate his father, he had to conclude the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360, in which he abandoned large portions of south-western France to Edward III of England and agreed to pay a huge ransom.
Charles became king in 1364. With the help of talented advisers known as the Marmousets, his skillful management of the kingdom allowed him to replenish the royal treasure and to restore the prestige of the House of Valois. He established the first permanent army paid with regular wages, which liberated the French populace from the companies of routiers who regularly plundered the country when not employed. Led by Bertrand du Guesclin, the French Army was able to turn the tide of the Hundred Years' War to Charles' advantage, and by the end of Charles' reign, they had reconquered almost all the territories ceded to the English in 1360. Furthermore, the French Navy, led by Jean de Vienne, managed to attack the English coast for the first time since the beginning of the Hundred Years' War.
Charles V died in 1380. He was succeeded by his son Charles VI the Mad, whose disastrous reign allowed the English to regain control of large parts of France.

Orchamus was a king in Greek mythology.  He had two daughters: Leucothea and Clytia.  Leucothea was raped by Helios, the sun god. Helios disguised himself as Leucothea's mother Euronome to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Helios for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister's trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea buried alive. Helios refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grievous Clytia wilted and slowly died. Helios changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

The Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) mentioned an Aegea, queen of the Amazons, as an alternative eponym of the Aegean Sea. Aegea was also the name of the wife of the Roman proconsul of Achaia, whom the apostle Andrew converted and baptised, according to Jacob de Voragine's Golden Legend, De Sancto Andrea Apostolo.  "Aegea" is found in modern baby-name books and carried by some contemporary women. Aegeas name derived from the Aegean sea.

[[Flerovium]]
CATEGORIES: Flerovium, Chemical elements, Synthetic elements

[tpl]Use dmy dates|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]Infobox flerovium[/tpl]
Flerovium is the superheavy artificial chemical element with the symbol Fl and atomic number 114. It is an extremely radioactive element that can only be created in the laboratory and does not occur in nature. The element is named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, where the element was discovered in 1998. The name of the laboratory, in turn, honors the Russian physicist Georgy Flyorov. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012.
In the periodic table of the elements, it is a transactinide element in the p-block. It is a member of the 7th period and is currently placed as the heaviest known member of the carbon group. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases. More recent results show that flerovium's reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium, showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, and that while it would show metallic properties, consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead, it would also be the least reactive metal in group 14.
About 80 atoms of flerovium have been observed to date: 50 were synthesized directly, while the rest were made from the radioactive decay of even heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms have been shown to have mass numbers from 285 to 289. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6 seconds, but it is possible that this flerovium isotope may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 66 seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of a superheavy element. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.

[[Ununtrium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Synthetic elements, Ununtrium

Ununtrium is the temporary name of a chemical element with the temporary symbol Uut and atomic number 113. Also known as eka-thallium or simply element 113, is an extremely radioactive synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature); the most stable known isotope, ununtrium-286, has a half-life of 20 seconds. Ununtrium was first created in 2003 by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia.
In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. Ununtrium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, although it should also show several major differences from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it is predicted to show some transition metal character.

Cyrus the Younger, son of Darius II of Persia and Parysatis, was a Persian prince and general. His birth date is unknown, but he died in 401 BC after a failed battle to oust his brother, Artaxerxes II, from the Persian throne.
The history of Cyrus and of the retreat of the Greeks is told by Xenophon in his Anabasis. Another account, probably from Sophaenetus of Stymphalus, was used by Ephorus. Further information is contained in the excerpts from Artaxerxes II's physician, Ctesias, by Photius; Plutarch’s Lives of Artaxerxes II and Lysander; and Thucydides' History of Peloponnesian War.[tpl]cite book|last=Strassler|first=R.B.|title=The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War|year=1996|publisher=Free Press New York|isbn=0-684-82790-5|pages=128, 549[/tpl] These are the only early sources of information on Cyrus the Younger.

Clearchus or Clearch ([tpl]lang-grc|Κλέαρχος[/tpl]), the son of Rhamphias, was a Spartan general and mercenary.
Born about the middle of the 5th century BC, Clearchus was sent with a fleet to the Hellespont in 411 and became governor of Byzantium, of which town he was proxenus. His severity, however, made him unpopular, and in his absence the gates were opened to the Athenian besieging army under Alcibiades (409).
Subsequently Clearchus returned to Sparta and appealed to the ephors, asking to be given a force to settle the political dissensions then rife at Byzantium and to protect the city and the neighbouring Greek colonies from Thracian attacks. He was granted that force, but when the ephors learned that the citizens of Byzantium considered him a tyrant, they recalled him through a messenger that reached Clearchus while he was still in the Isthmus of Corinth. Clearchus ignored the messenger and proceeded to Byzantium, and thus he was instantly declared an outlaw by the ephors. He fought the Thracian tribes successfully, in the process gaining the unofficial support of the Greek cities that where thus relieved. Clearchus, counting on his successes to gain him back the Spartan ephors' good graces, was ultimately disappointed in this expectation. When Cyrus learned that a Greek force in high fighting condition was so near Asia, he sent ambassadors with money (10,000 Persian darics) asking Clearchus to help him claim the throne from his brother, the Persian Emperor Artaxerxes II Mnemon. Clearchus accepted not because of the money but because he knew that sooner or later he would have to face his fellow Spartans since he was still considered an outlaw by the ephors. He left the command of the garrison of Byzantium to Helixus of Megara (see Coeratadas).
In the "expedition of the ten thousand" undertaken by Cyrus to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes, Clearchus led the Peloponnesian delegation of the Army of the Ten Thousand, who formed the right wing of Cyrus’s army at the battle of Cunaxa (401). On Cyrus’s death Clearchus assumed the chief command and conducted the retreat until, being treacherously seized with his fellow-generals by the satrap of Sardis, Tissaphernes, he was handed over to Artaxerxes and executed .

Altitude sickness—also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), altitude illness, hypobaropathy, "the altitude bends", or soroche—is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans, caused by acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet).
It presents as a collection of nonspecific symptoms, acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure, resembling a case of "flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover".The Mountaineers. Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 7th Edition. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2003 It is hard to determine who will be affected by altitude sickness, as there are no specific factors that correlate with a susceptibility to altitude sickness. However, most people can ascend to 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) without difficulty.
Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), which are potentially fatal.
Chronic mountain sickness, also known as Monge's disease, is a different condition that only occurs after very prolonged exposure to high altitude.A.J. Giannini, H.R. Black, R.L. Goettsche.

Philip VI  (1293 – 22 August 1350), called the Fortunate (French: le FortunéHeraldique-Europeenne) and of Valois, was the first King of France from the House of Valois. He reigned from 1328 until his death. 
Philip's reign was dominated by the consequences of a succession dispute. When King Charles IV the Fair died without a male heir in 1328, the nearest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, who inherited his claim through his mother Isabella of France, the sister of the dead king. It was held in France, however, that Edward was ineligible to inherit the French throne through the female line according to the ancient Salic Law.  At first, Edward seemed to accept Philip's accession as the nearest male relative of Charles IV descended through the male line, however he pressed his claim to the throne of France after a series of disagreements with Philip.  The result was the beginning of the Hundred Years' War in 1337. 
After initial successes at sea, Philip's navy was annihilated at the Battle of Sluys in 1340, ensuring that the war would occur on the continent. The English took another decisive advantage at the Battle of Crécy (1346), while the Black Death struck France, further destabilizing the country.
In 1349, Philip VI bought the Dauphiné from its ruined ruler Humbert II and entrusted the government of this province to his grandson Charles. Philip VI died in 1350 and was succeeded by his son John II the Good.

John II (16 April 1319 – 8 April 1364), or Jean II, also called John the Good ([tpl]lang-fr|Jean le Bon[/tpl]), was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 1350 until his death.
When John II came to power, France was facing several disasters: the Black Death, which caused the death of nearly half of its population, free companies of routiers who plundered the country, and English aggression that resulted in disastrous military losses, including the Battle of Poitiers of 1356, in which John was captured.
While John was a prisoner in London, his son Charles became regent and faced several rebellions, which he overcame. To liberate his father, he concluded the Treaty of Brétigny (1360), by which France lost many territories and paid an enormous ransom.
In an exchange of hostages, including his son Louis, John was released from captivity to raise funds for his ransom. Upon his return in France, he created the franc to stabilize the currency and tried to get rid of the free companies by sending them to a crusade, but Pope Innocent VI died shortly before their meeting in Avignon. When John was informed that Louis had escaped from captivity, he voluntarily returned to England, where he died in 1364. He was succeeded by his son Charles V.

[[Songbird]]
CATEGORIES: Passeri, Songbirds

A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin oscen, "a songbird". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. 
Songbirds form one of the two major lineages of extant perching birds, the other being the Tyranni which are most diverse in the Neotropics and absent from many parts of the world. These have a simpler syrinx musculature, and while their vocalizations are often just as complex and striking as those of songbirds, they are altogether more mechanical sounding. There is a third perching bird lineage, the Acanthisitti from New Zealand, of which only two species remain alive today.Barker, F. K. Cibois, A. Schikler, P. A. Feinstein, J. & Cracraft, J. (2004) Phylogeny and diversification of the largest avian radiation. PNAS 101(30): 11040-11045
There is evidence to suggest that songbirds evolved 50 million years ago in the part of Gondwana that later became Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Antarctica, before spreading around the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

On Charles's death (741), Carloman and his brother Pepin the Short succeeded to their father's legal positions, Carloman in Austrasia, and Pepin in Neustria. He was a member of the family later called the Carolingians and it can be argued that he was instrumental in consolidating their power at the expense of the ruling Merovingian kings of the Franks. He withdrew from public life in 747 to take up the monastic habit, "the first of a new type of saintly king," according to Norman Cantor, "more interested in religious devotion than royal power, who frequently appeared in the following three centuries and who was an indication of the growing impact of Christian piety on Germanic society".Norman Cantor, 1993.

Homs is a major industrial centre, and with a population of at least 652,609 people in 2004,2004 census. it is the third largest city in Syria after Aleppo to the north and the capital Damascus to the south. Its population reflects Syria's general religious diversity, composed mostly of Arabic-speaking Sunni Muslims and Alawite and Christian minorities. There are a number of historic mosques and churches in the city, and it is close to the Krak des Chevaliers castle, a world heritage site.
Homs did not emerge into the historical record until the 1st century BCE at the time of the Seleucids. It later became the capital of a kingdom ruled by the Emesani dynasty who gave the city its name. Originally a center of worship for the sun god El-Gabal, it later gained importance in Christianity under the Byzantines. Homs was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th-century and made capital of a district that bore its current name. Throughout the Islamic era, Muslim dynasties contending for control of Syria sought after Homs due to the city's strategic position in the area. Homs began to decline under the Ottomans and only in the 19th century did the city regain its economic importance when its cotton industry boomed. During French Mandate rule, the city became a center of insurrection and, after independence in 1946, a center of Baathist resistance to the first Syrian governments.
In the ongoing Syrian civil war, Homs became an opposition stronghold and the Syrian government launched a military assault against the city in May 2011. By 14 January, the government was in control of Homs except for the Old City, which remains in rebel hands and is under government siege. Fighting has left large parts of the city destroyed.Homs: Syrian revolution's 'capital'. BBC News. 2014-01-27.

Perspiration (sweating, transpiration, or diaphoresis) is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/99/3/781.pdf |title=Simultaneous Study of Constituents of Urine and Perspiration |author=Mosher HH |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |year=1933 |volume=99 |pages=781–790 |issue=3[/tpl]
Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands. The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.
In humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2-4 liters per hour or 10-14 liters per day (10-15 g/min•m²), but is less in children prior to puberty.Jessen,C., Temperature regulation in humans and other mammals, Springer, Berlin, 2000, 193 ppMack,G.W. and Nadel,E.R., Body fluid balance during heat stress in humans.

Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling. Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx.

The logistics of physical items usually involves the integration of information flow, material handling, production, packaging, inventory, transportation, warehousing, and often security. The complexity of logistics can be modeled, analyzed, visualized, and optimized by dedicated simulation software. The minimization of the use of resources is a common motivation in logistics for import and export.

[[The Duck Family (Disney)]]

CATEGORIES: Disney core universe characters, Fictional families, Disney comics characters, Fictional ducks

The Duck family is a fictional family created by The Walt Disney Company. Its best-known member is Donald Duck.
In the early 1950s Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter. Scrooge McDuck and Gladstone Gander being the most notable among them. But the exact relation between them was still somewhat uncertain. Barks decided to create a personal version of their Family tree. To better define their relations he added several previously unknown relatives. Barks never intended to publish this family tree as he had created it for his personal use.
The first public attempt at a coherent biography of the ducks was published in 1974. An Informal Biography of Scrooge McDuck by science fiction author Jack Chalker used names and events in the Barks stories (and a very few non-Barks ones) to create a life story for McDuck. It provided the basis for a Scrooge biography included in The People's Almanac."The People Who Never Were -- Yet Live Today." The People's Almanac, edited by David Wallenchinsky and Irving Wallace. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday & C., 1975. p. 1235-1237.
By 1978 the Duck family were ingrained sufficiently in popular culture that a character in the movie Corvette Summer quips "Just call me Gladstone Duck‏" after being lucky.Reviews & Ratings for Corvette Summer 
In 1981 Barks was well into his retirement but his stories remained popular and had gained him unexpected fame. He had given several interviews and answered questions about his personal views on the characters and their stories. Among other subjects, Backs described his early version of the family tree. Rough sketches of the tree were published in a number of fanzines. Fans of the characters were pleased for the background it added to them. At this point Mark Worden decided to create a drawing of this family tree including portraits of the characters mentioned. Otherwise Worden made few changes to the tree, most notably adding Daisy Duck as Donald's main love interest. His illustrated version of the tree was published at first in several fanzines and later in the Carl Barks Library. The later was a ten-volume collection of his works in hardcover black-and-white edition.
In 1987 Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck and his various associates. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fanbase of his own. In the early 1990s Egmont, the publishing house employing Don Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment. He was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree accompanying it. This was supposed to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The family tree accompanying it was first published in Norway on July 3, 1993.
In the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Rosa studied Barks' old stories mentioning his past. Then he added several ideas of his own. Among them were biographical information for Scrooge's supporting cast. In a way Scrooge's biography was also their own biography.

It is coexistent with the Duck universe, a spin-off of the Mickey Mouse universe which centers around Mickey's friend Donald Duck and his rich uncle Scrooge McDuck. "Mickey Mouse universe" is not an official term used by Disney.
Since 1990, the actual city in which Mickey lives is most often called Mouseton and is often seen as the city next to Duckburg, Donald's hometown. According to traditional continuity, both cities are located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, a portmanteau of California and Minnesota. The Mickey Mouse universe is also a parallel universe and characters often visit real-world places and meet historical figures.

The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA or Air Force)Unlike the United States Military Academy at West Point, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, which are often referred to by their respective city names, the Air Force Academy is not normally referred to as "Colorado Springs." is a military academy for officer candidates for the United States Air Force. Its campus is located immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County, Colorado, United States. The Academy's stated mission is "to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.""A Quick Look at the U.S. Air Force Academy,  ,"USAFA Fact Sheet, May 2008 It is the youngest of the five United States service academies, having graduated its first class in 1959. Graduates of the Academy's four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree, and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force.Since 1959, cadets have also been able to "cross-commission" into the Army, Navy or Marine Corps, and each year a small number of graduates does so, usually in a one-for-one "trade" with similarly inclined cadets at the other service academies. Foreign cadets and graduates who have lost their medical qualification for commissioning while at the Academy (a small number each year) may receive a degree but are not commissioned. The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado, attracting more than a million visitors each year.
Candidates for admission are judged on their academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, athletics and character. To gain admission, candidates must also pass a fitness test, undergo a thorough medical examination, and secure a nomination, which usually comes from the member of Congress in the candidate's home district. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; historically just under 1,000 of those will graduate.Air Force Academy Admissions Web site, last visited 22 Mar 2007.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Tuition along with room and board are all paid for by the U.S. government.  Cadets receive a monthly stipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service after graduation.The commitment is normally five years of active duty and three years of reserves, although it has varied. The obligation attaches on the first day of a cadet's second class (junior) year, and non-graduates after that point are expected to fulfill their obligations in enlisted service.
The program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of "Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do", and based on four "pillars of excellence": military training, academics, athletics and character development. In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either intercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development and leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership. Each of the components of the program is intended to give cadets the skills and knowledge that they will need for success as officers.

Nicaea ([tpl]IPAc-en|n|aɪ|'|s|i:|ə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Νίκαια[/tpl]) was a Hellenic city in northwestern Anatolia, and is primarily known as the site of the First and Second Councils of Nicaea (the first and seventh Ecumenical councils in the early history of the Christian Church), the Nicene Creed (which comes from the First Council), and as the capital city of the Empire of Nicaea following the Fourth Crusade in 1204, until the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261.
The ancient city is located within modern Iznik, Turkey, and is situated in a fertile basin at the eastern end of Lake Ascanius, bounded by ranges of hills to the north and south. It is situated with its west wall rising from the lake itself, providing both protection from siege from that direction, as well as a source of supplies which would be difficult to cut off. The lake is large enough that it could not be blockaded from the land easily, and the city was large enough to make any attempt to reach the harbour from shore-based siege weapons very difficult.
The ancient city is surrounded on all sides by [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of walls about [tpl]convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high. These are in turn surrounded by a double ditch on the land portions, and also included over 100 towers in various locations. Large gates on the three landbound sides of the walls provided the only entrance to the city.
Today the walls have been pierced in many places for roads, but much of the early work survives and, as a result, it is a major tourist destination.

Fritillaria imperialis (Crown imperial or Kaiser's crown) is a species of flowering plant of the genus Fritillaria, family Liliaceae, native to a wide stretch from Anatolia and Iraq across the plateau of Iran to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Himalayan foothills. It is also widely cultivated as an ornamental and reportedly naturalized in Austria. The common names and also the epithet "imperialis" refer to the large circle of golden flowers, reminiscent of an emperor's crown.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families
Fritillaria imperialis grows to about [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in height, and bears lance-shaped, glossy leaves at intervals along the stem. It bears a prominent whorl of downward facing flowers at the top of the stem, topped by a 'crown' of small leaves, hence the name. While the wild form is usually orange-red, various colours are found in cultivation, ranging from nearly a true scarlet through oranges to yellow. The pendulous flowers make a bold statement in the late spring garden; in the northern hemisphere, flowering takes place in late spring, accompanied by a distinctly foxy odour that repels mice, moles and other rodents.[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl]Linnaeus, Carl. 1753.

Due to the way that the bulb is formed, with the stem emerging from a depression, it is best to plant it on its side, to prevent water causing rot at the top of the bulb.http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/5917.shtml BBC Gardening Fritillaria imperialis requires full sun for best growth, and sandy, well-drained soil for permanence. After flowering and complete drying of the leaves, the stems should be cut off just above the ground.
Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use, of which the yellow-flowered 'Maximea Lutea' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[tpl]cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - Fritillaira imperialis 'Maximea Lutea'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2945|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl]

Ofonius Tigellinus, also known as Tigellinus Ofonius, Ophonius Tigellinus and Sophonius Tigellinus (c. 10–69), was a prefect of the Roman imperial bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, from 62 until 68, during the reign of emperor Nero. Tigellinus gained imperial favour through his acquaintance with Nero's mother Agrippina the Younger, and was appointed prefect upon the death of his predecessor Sextus Afranius Burrus, a position Tigellinus held first with Faenius Rufus and then Nymphidius Sabinus. 
As a friend of Nero he quickly gained a reputation around Rome for cruelty and licentiousness. During the second half of the 60s however, the emperor became increasingly unpopular with the people and the army, leading to several rebellions which ultimately led to his downfall and suicide in 68. When Nero's demise appeared imminent, Tigellinus deserted him and shifted his allegiance to the new emperor Galba. Unfortunately for Tigellinus, Galba was replaced by Otho barely six months after his accession. Otho ordered the execution of Tigellinus, upon which he committed suicide.

[[Scout rifle]]
CATEGORIES: Rifles

The Scout Rifle is a class of general-purpose rifles defined and promoted by Jeff Cooper in the early 1980s.
These bolt action carbines are typically .308 caliber (7.62mm), less than 1 meter in length, and less than [tpl]convert|3|kg|lb|abbr=off[/tpl] in weight, with iron and optical sights and fitted with practical slings (such as Ching slings) for shooting and carrying, and capable of hitting man-sized targets out to 450 meters without scopes. Typically they employ forward-mounted low-power long eye relief scopes or sights to afford easy access to the top of the rifle action for rapid reloading. Although the Steyr Scout is the only rifle Jeff Cooper has been personally involved with, Ruger, Savage, and several other gun makers now manufacture Scout rifles that roughly match Cooper's specifications.
A lifelong student of small arms, and recognized expert in the field, Cooper realized that rifles in the late 20th century differed little from those made one hundred years before, and that advances in metallurgy, optics and plastics could make the rifle a handy, light instrument "that will do a great many things equally well..."
"The general-purpose rifle will do equally well for all but specialized hunting, as well as for fighting; thus it must be powerful enough to kill any living target of reasonable size. If you insist upon a definition of 'reasonable size,' let us introduce an arbitrary mass figure of about [tpl]convert|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl]."The Art of the Rifle by Jeff Cooper, p. 18

Charles VIII, called the Affable, [tpl]lang-fr|l'Affable[/tpl] (30 June 1470 – 7 April 1498), was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 1483 to his death in 1498. He succeeded his father Louis XI at the age of 13.Paul Murray Kendall, Louis XI: The Universal Spider (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1971), p. 373.  His elder sister Anne of France acted as regent jointly with her husband Peter II, Duke of Bourbon until 1491 when the young king turned 21 years of age. During Anne's regency, the great lords rebelled against royal centralisation efforts in a conflict known as the Mad War (1485-1488), which resulted in a victory for the royal government.
In a remarkable stroke of audacity, Charles married Anne of Brittany in 1491 after she had already been married by proxy to the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in a ceremony of questionable validity. Preoccupied by the problematic succession in the Kingdom of Hungary, Maximilian failed to press his claim. Upon his marriage, Charles became Duke of Brittany and created a Union of Brittany and France that enabled France to avoid total encirclement by Habsburg territories.
To secure his rights to the Neapolitan throne that René of Naples had left to his father, Charles made a series of concessions to neighbouring monarchs and conquered the Italian peninsula without much opposition. The coalition formed against the French invasion of 1494-98 finally drove out Charles' army, but Italian Wars would dominate Western European politics for over 50 years.
Charles died in 1498 after accidentally striking his head on the lintel of a door. Since he had no male heir, he was succeeded by his cousin Louis XII of France from the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois.

Sergeant York is a 1941 biographical film about the life of Alvin York, one of the most-decorated American soldiers of World War I. It was directed by Howard Hawks and was the highest-grossing film of the year.[ref]FILM MONEY-MAKERS SELECTED BY VARIETY: ' Sergeant York' Top Picture, Gary Cooper Leading Star
New York Times (1923-Current file) York, N.Y 31 Dec 1941: 21.[/ref]
The film was based on the diary of Sergeant Alvin York, as edited by Tom Skeyhill,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:43758~T1 |title=Sergeant York Review |publisher=Allmovie |accessdate=2008-07-25[/tpl] and adapted by Harry Chandlee, Abem Finkel, John Huston, Howard Koch, and Sam Cowan (uncredited).  York refused, several times, to authorize a film version of his life story, but finally yielded to persistent efforts in order to finance the creation of an interdenominational Bible school.  The story, that York insisted on Gary Cooper for the title role, derives from the fact that producer Jesse L. Lasky recruited Cooper by writing a plea that he accept the role and then signed York's name to the telegram.David D. Lee, Sergeant York: An American Hero (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 1985), 105ff.
Cooper went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal. The film also won for Best Film Editing and was nominated in nine other categories, including Best Picture, Director (Hawks), Supporting Actor (Walter Brennan), and Supporting Actress (Margaret Wycherly). The American Film Institute ranked the film 57th in the its 100 most inspirational American movies. It also rated Alvin York 35th in its list of the top 50 heroes in American cinema.

Kings Row is a 1942 film starring Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, and Ronald Reagan that tells a story of young people growing up in a small American town at the turn of the twentieth century, beset by social pressure, dark secrets, and the challenges and tragedies one must face as a result of these hard facts. The picture was directed by Sam Wood.
The film, which was Ronald Reagan's most notable role during his early acting career at Warner Brothers, was adapted by Casey Robinson from a best-selling 1940 novel of the same name by Henry Bellamann.Variety film review; December 24, 1941, page 8.Harrison's Reports film review; December 27, 1941, page 208. The movie also features Betty Field, Charles Coburn, and Claude Rains. The musical score was composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and the cinematographer was James Wong Howe.
In the film, Reagan's character, Drake McHugh, has both legs amputated by a sadistic surgeon, played by Coburn. When he comes to following the operation, he gasps in shock, disbelief, and horror, "Where's the REST of me???" Reagan used that line as the title of his 1965 autobiography.  Reagan and most film critics considered Kings Row his best movie. Reagan called the film a "slightly sordid but moving yarn" that "made me a star."

[[Junior Woodchucks]]
CATEGORIES: Donald Duck television series, Fictional organizations, Scouting in popular culture

The Junior Woodchucks of the World are the Scouting organization to which Huey, Dewey, and Louie belong. They have a uniform with a coonskin cap. The Junior Woodchucks were created by Carl Barks in 1951, in the story "Operation St. Bernhard" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, Junior Chickadees, to which Daisy Duck's nieces, April, May and June belong. A hallmark of the Woodchucks are exalted titles and ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become Ten Star Generals in the 1952 story of that name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with severe ideals as to decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at aspects of the Boy Scouts.
The Junior Woodchucks also have Scoutmasters. This role is usually taken by Donald (although in Don Rosa's story W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N., Donald is revealed to never having been allowed to join the Junior Woodchucks on account of his "hot temper"), or Launchpad McQuack in the Ducktales cartoon, where they also had a baseball team, which Launchpad also coached. In some Italian stories the scoutmaster is a tall, strong and wise (but afraid of flight) goose called gran mogol (the great moghul), whose name is Bertie McGoose.
Junior Woodchucks always carry with them a copy of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, a fictional guidebook filled with detailed and pertinent information about whatever country or situation the Woodchucks find themselves.

Don Rosa wrote and drew a story regarding the origin of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, "Guardians of the Lost Library", which Comics Buyer's Guide mentioned as possibly the greatest comic book story of all time. Rosa's later story W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N. tells of how Huey, Dewey, and Louie came to join the Junior Woodchucks.

Most of the early Junior Woodchucks stories appeared in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories. They also appeared in Donald Duck and in Uncle Scrooge. In 1966, they got their own title, Huey, Dewey, and Louie and the Junior Woodchucks, published by Gold Key Comics for 62 issues, and then continued by Whitman Comics for another 20 issues until 1983. The stories which Carl Barks wrote for this comic book, among the last comic book stories he scripted, were drawn by Kay Wright, John Carey and Tony Strobl. More recently Daan Jippes has been commissioned by Egmont to redraw these stories emulating Barks' style and drawing inspiration from the sketches of Barks' storyboard-like scripts.

He came to my desk and said, 'Go get the rest of your pals and bring them to my office.' So I went to my compatriots and said, 'Sol wants to have a Junior Woodchucks meeting.' I was making a joke, using the name of the faux-Boy Scouts that Huey, Dewey and Louie of Donald Duck fame belonged to.

Mankiewicz

The Pride of the Yankees is a 1942 American film directed by Sam Wood and starring Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, and Walter Brennan.  It is a tribute to the legendary New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig, who died only one year before its release, at age 37, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which later became known to the lay public as "Lou Gehrig's disease".
Though subtitled "The Life of Lou Gehrig", the film is less a sports biography than an homage to a heroic and widely loved sports figure whose tragic and premature death touched the entire nation. It emphasizes Gehrig's relationship with his parents (particularly his strong-willed mother), his friendships with players and journalists, and his storybook romance with the woman who became his "companion for life," Eleanor. Details of his baseball career—which were still fresh in most fans' minds in 1942—are limited to montages of ballparks, pennants, and Cooper swinging bats and running bases, though Gehrig's best-known major league record—2,130 consecutive games played—is prominently cited.
Yankee teammates Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig, and Bill Dickey play themselves, as does sportscaster Bill Stern. The film was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, and an uncredited Casey Robinson from a story by Paul Gallico, and received 11 Academy Award nominations. Its climax is a re-enactment of Gehrig's poignant 1939 farewell speech at Yankee Stadium.  The film's iconic closing line—"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth"—was voted 38th on the American Film Institute's list of 100 greatest movie quotes.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=The Pride of the Yankees|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035211/ IMDB|accessdate=2011-11-16[/tpl]

Random Harvest is a 1942 film based on the 1941 James Hilton novel of the same name, directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Claudine West, George Froeschel and Arthur Wimperis adapted the novel for the screen, and received an Academy Award nomination for their work. The film departed from the novel in several significant ways, as it proved nearly impossible to translate to film otherwise. It starred Ronald Colman as a  shellshocked, amnesiac First World War soldier and Greer Garson as his love interest.
It was an instant commercial success. Its seven Academy Award nominations included nods for Colman, supporting actress Susan Peters, director Mervyn LeRoy, and the Best Picture. Garson, whose performance was well-received, was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Actress, as she had already been nominated that year for her role in Mrs. Miniver.

Louis XII (27 June 1462 – 1 January 1515) was a monarch of the House of Valois who ruled as King of France from 1498 to 1515 and King of Naples from 1501 to 1504. The son of Charles, Duke of Orléans, and Maria of Cleves, he succeeded his cousin Charles VIII, who died without a closer heir in 1498.
Before his accession to the throne of France, he was known as Louis of Orléans and was compelled to be married to his handicapped and sterile cousin Joan by his uncle, king Louis XI. By doing so, Louis XI hoped to extinguish the Orléans cadet branch of the House of Valois.
Louis of Orléans was one of the great feudal lords who opposed the French monarchy in the conflict known as the Mad War. At the royal victory in the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier in 1488, Louis was captured, but Charles VIII pardoned him and released him. He subsequently took part in the Italian War of 1494–1498 as one of the French commanders.
When Louis XII became king in 1498, he had his marriage with Joan annulled by Pope Alexander VI and instead married Anne of Brittany, the widow of his cousin Charles VIII. This marriage allowed Louis to reinforce the personal Union of Brittany and France.
Louis persevered in the Italian Wars, initiating a second Italian campaign for the control of the Kingdom of Naples. Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan in 1500 and pushed forward to the Kingdom of Naples, which fell to him in 1501. Proclaimed King of Naples, Louis faced a new coalition gathered by Ferdinand II of Aragon and was forced to cede Naples to Spain in 1504.
Louis XII did not encroach on the power of local governments or the privileges of the nobility, in opposition with the long tradition of the French kings to impose an absolute monarchy in France. A popular king, Louis was proclaimed "Father of the People" ([tpl]lang-fr|Le Père du Peuple[/tpl]) in 1506 by the Estates-General of Tours for his reduction of the tax known as taille, legal reforms, and civil peace within France.
Louis, who remained Duke of Milan after the second Italian War, was interested in further expansion in the Italian Peninsula and launched a third Italian War (1508–1516), which was marked by the military prowess of the Chevalier de Bayard.
Louis XII died in 1515 without a male heir. He was succeeded by his cousin Francis from the Angoulême cadet branch of the House of Valois.

[[Hagfish]]
CATEGORIES: Edible fish, Myxinidae, Vertebrates without jaws, Fish of the Pacific Ocean, Scavengers

Hagfish, the class Myxini (also known as Hyperotreti), are eel-shaped, slime-producing, marine fish (occasionally called slime eels). They are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column. Along with lampreys, hagfish are jawless and are living fossils; they are basal to vertebrates, and living hagfish remain similar to hagfish 300 million years ago.Myxini – University of California Museum of Paleontology
The classification of hagfish has been controversial. The issue is whether the hagfish is itself a degenerate type of vertebrate-fish (most closely related to lampreys), or else may represent a stage which precedes the evolution of the vertebral column (as do lancelets). The original scheme groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed-vertebrates). An alternative scheme proposed that jawed-vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish. Recent DNA evidence has supported the original scheme.[tpl]cite journal|author=Janvier, P.|year= 2010|title=MicroRNAs revive old views about jawless vertebrate divergence and evolution|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107|pages=19137–19138|quote=Although I was among the early supporters of vertebrate paraphyly, I am impressed by the evidence provided by Heimberg et al. and prepared to admit that cyclostomes are, in fact, monophyletic.

Military historians do not agree on precise boundaries between the campaigns of this era. This article uses the classification maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. See Classifying the campaigns. during the American Civil War. Although it is more popularly known as the Siege of Petersburg, it was not a classic military siege, in which a city is usually surrounded and all supply lines are cut off, nor was it strictly limited to actions against Petersburg. The campaign was nine months of trench warfare in which Union forces commanded by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Petersburg unsuccessfully and then constructed trench lines that eventually extended over [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] from the eastern outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, to around the eastern and southern outskirts of Petersburg. Petersburg was crucial to the supply of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and the Confederate capital of Richmond. Numerous raids were conducted and battles fought in attempts to cut off the railroad supply lines through Petersburg to Richmond, and many of these caused the lengthening of the trench lines, overloading dwindling Confederate resources.
Lee finally gave in to the overwhelming pressure—the point at which supply lines were finally cut and a true siege would have begun—and abandoned both cities in April 1865, leading to his retreat and surrender at Appomattox Court House. The Siege of Petersburg foreshadowed the trench warfare that was common in World War I, earning it a prominent position in military history. It also featured the war's largest concentration of African American troops, who suffered heavy casualties at such engagements as the Battle of the Crater and Chaffin's Farm.

[[Scar]]

CATEGORIES: Diseases involving the fasciae

Scars are areas of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) that replace normal skin after injury. A scar results from the biological process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the healing process. With the exception of very minor lesions, every wound (e.g., after accident, disease, or surgery) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this is animals with complete regeneration, which regrow tissue without scars formation.
Scar tissue is composed of the same protein (collagen) as the tissue that it replaces,[ref]

[[Aegimius]]
CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Heracles, Dorian mythology, Mythological kings of Thessaly, Greek culture heroes, Ancient Greek epic poems

Aegimius ([tpl]lang-grc|Αἰγίμιος[/tpl]) was the Greek mythological ancestor of the Dorians, who is described as their king and lawgiver at the time when they were yet inhabiting the northern parts of Thessaly.Pindar, Pythian Odes i. 124, v. 96 He asked Heracles for help in a war against the Lapiths and, in gratitude, offered him one-third of his kingdom. The Lapiths were conquered, but Heracles did not take for himself the territory promised to him by Aegimius, and left it in trust to the king who was to preserve it for the sons of Heracles, the Heracleidae.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 7. § 7Diodorus Siculus, 4. 37
Aegimius had two sons, Dymas and Pamphylus, who migrated to the Peloponnese and were regarded as the ancestors of two branches of the Doric race, the Dymanes and the Pamphylians of Anatolia, while the third branch, the Hylleans, derived its name from Hyllas, the son of Heracles, who had been adopted by Aegimius.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca ii. 8. § 3; Scholia on Pindar, First Pythian Ode, line 121
There existed in antiquity an epic poem Aegimius of which a few fragments are extant,[ref]
</ref>
and which is sometimes ascribed to Hesiod and sometimes to Cercops of Miletus.Athen. xi. p. 503; Stephanus of Byzantium, s.v. [tpl]lang|grc|Αβαντίς[/tpl] The poem, printed among Hesiodic fragments,Hesiod: Fragments, translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White, 1914: on-line text. survives in fewer than a dozen quotations, and seems to have been in part concerned with the myth of Io and Argos Panoptes.

[[Hyllus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Heracleidae

In Greek mythology, Hyllus (Ὕλλος) (also Hyllas Ὕλᾱς[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]) was the son of Heracles and Deianira,Hesiod, Catalogue of Women fr. 25.17–19. husband of Iole, nursed by Abia.
Heracles, whom Zeus had originally intended to be ruler of Argos, Lacedaemon and Messenian Pylos, had been supplanted by the cunning of Hera, and his intended possessions had fallen into the hands of Eurystheus, king of Mycenae. After the death of Heracles, his children, after many wanderings, found refuge from Eurystheus at Athens. Eurystheus, on his demand for their surrender being refused, attacked Athens, but was defeated and slain.  
Hyllus and his brothers invaded Peloponnesus, but after a year's stay were forced by a pestilence to quit. They withdrew to Thessaly, where Aegimius, the mythical ancestor of the Dorians, whom Heracles had assisted in war against the Lapidae, adopted Hyllus and made over to him a third part of his territory. After the death of Aegimius, his two sons, Pamphylus and Dymas, voluntarily submitted to Hyllus (who was, according to the Dorian tradition in Herodotus V. 72, really an Achaean), who thus became ruler of the Dorians, the three branches of that race being named after these three heroes. Being desirous of reconquering his paternal inheritance, Hyllus consulted the Delphic oracle, which told him to wait for "the third fruit," and then enter Peloponnesus by "a narrow passage by sea." 
Accordingly, after three years, Hyllus marched across the isthmus of Corinth to attack Atreus, the successor of Eurystheus, but was slain in single combat by Echemus, king of Tegea. This second attempt was followed by a third under his son Cleodaeus and a fourth under his grandson Aristomachus, both of which were equally unsuccessful.  At last, Temenus, Cresphontes and Aristodemus, the sons of Aristomachus, complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them.  They received the answer that by the "third fruit" the "third generation" was meant, and that  the "narrow passage" was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of Rhium. 
They accordingly built a fleet at Naupactus, but before they set sail, Aristodemus was struck by lightning (or shot by Apollo) and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heracleidae had slain an Acarnanian soothsayer.  The oracle, being again consulted by Temenus, bade him offer an expiatory sacrifice and banish the murderer for ten years, and look out for a man with three eyes to act as guide.  On his way back to Naupactus, Temenus fell in with Oxylus, an Aetolian, who had lost one eye, riding on a horse (thus making up the three eyes) and immediately pressed him into his service.  According to another account, a mule on which Oxylus rode had lost an eye.   
The Heracleidae repaired their ships, sailed from Naupactus to Antirrhium, and thence to Rhium in Peloponnesus.  A decisive, battle was fought with Tisamenus, son of Orestes, the chief ruler in the peninsula, who was defeated and slain.  The Heracleidae, who thus became practically masters of Peloponnesus, proceeded to distribute its territory among themselves by lot. Argos fell to Temenus, Lacedaemon to Procles and Eurysthenes, the twin sons of Aristodemus; and Messene to Cresphontes.  The fertile district of Elis had been reserved by agreement for Oxylus.   
The Heracleidae ruled in Lacedaemon until 221 BC, but disappeared much earlier in the other countries.  This conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, commonly called the "Return of the Heracleidae," is represented as the recovery by the descendants of Heracles of the rightful inheritance of their hero ancestor and his sons.  The Dorians followed the custom of other Greek tribes in claiming as ancestor for their ruling families one of the legendary heroes, but the traditions must not on that account be regarded as entirely mythical.  They represent a joint invasion of Peloponnesus by Aetolians and Dorians, the latter having been driven southward from their original northern home under pressure from the Thessalians.  
It is noticeable that there is no mention of these Heracleidae or their invasion in Homer or Hesiod. Herodotus (vi. 52) speaks of poets who had celebrated their deeds, but these were limited to events immediately succeeding the death of Heracles.  The story was first amplified by the Greek tragedians, who probably drew their inspiration from local legends, which glorified the services rendered by Athens to the rulers of Peloponnesus. 
The Hylli or Hylleans were a Doric or  Illyrian tribe of Dalmatia, of whom Hyllus was eponymous. The name persisted into Roman times as Hyllica, the name of a headland on the coast south of Šibenik.John Wilkes, The Illyrians, 1995, p. 100. The  20th century Albanian national awakening  claimed Hyllus as an "Illyrian king", allegedly "recorded" to have died in 1225 BC, etymologizing the name as related to the Albanian word for "star".[ref]Constantin A. Chekrezi, Albania Past and Present, 1914, p. 11;   Wadham Peacock, Albania, the foundling state of Europe, 1914, p. 184.

Since You Went Away is a 1944 American film directed by John Cromwell for Selznick International Pictures and distributed by United Artists. It is an epic about the American home front during World War II which was adapted and produced by David O. Selznick from the 1943 novel Since You Went Away: Letters to a Soldier from His Wife by Margaret Buell Wilder.[tpl]OCLC|1397161[/tpl] The music score was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Stanley Cortez, Lee Garmes, George Barnes (uncredited) and Robert Bruce (uncredited).
The movie is set in a mid-sized American town, where people with loved ones in the military try to cope with their changed circumstances and make their own contributions to the war effort. The main characters are a housewife whose husband is away in the service and her two daughters who are just growing into womanhood. The story runs from early January to late December 1943; the film itself was made in late 1943 and early 1944.[tpl]cn|date=December 2011[/tpl]  Though sentimental, Since You Went Away is more somber and realistic about the carnage of war and the pain of separation than some[tpl]specify|date=December 2011[/tpl] other homefront movies made during World War II.

[[Figure of speech]]
CATEGORIES: Figures of speech, Rhetoric

A figure of  speech is the use of a word or a phrase, which transcends its literal interpretation. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a  phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words in it, as in idiom, metaphor, simile, hyperbole, personification, or synecdoche. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as any figure of speech introduces an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.  A figure of speech is sometimes called a rhetorical figure or a locution.
Rhetoric originated as the study of the ways in which a source text can be transformed to suit the goals of the person reusing the material. For this goal, classical rhetoric detected four fundamental operationsJansen (2008), quote from the summary:  Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example inthe improvement of pupils’ own writing.

[[Will and testament]]

A will or testament is a legal declaration by which a person, the testator, names one or more persons to manage his or her estate and provides for the distribution of his property at death. For the devolution of property not disposed of by will, see inheritance and intestacy.
Though it has at times been thought that a "will" was historically limited to real property while "testament" applies only to dispositions of personal property (thus giving rise to the popular title of the document as "Last Will and Testament"), the historical records show that the terms have been used interchangeably.Wills, Trusts, and Estates (Aspen, 7th Ed., 2005) Thus, the word "will" validly applies to both personal and real property. A will may also create a testamentary trust that is effective only after the death of the testator.

[[Sistine Chapel]]

The Sistine Chapel ([tpl]lang-la|Sacellum Sixtinum[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Cappella Sistina[/tpl]) is a large and renowned chapel of the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the Pope in the Vatican City.  Originally known as the Cappella Magna, the chapel takes its name from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1477 and 1480.  Since that time, the chapel has served as a place of both religious and functionary papal activity. Today it is the site of the Papal conclave, the process by which a new Pope is selected.  The fame of the Sistine Chapel lies mainly in the frescos that decorate the interior, and most particularly the Sistine Chapel ceiling and The Last Judgment by Michelangelo.
During the reign of Sixtus IV,  a team of Renaissance painters that included Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Roselli, created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, offset by papal portraits above and trompe l’oeil drapery below. These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483  Sixtus IV  celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel  for the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.[tpl]Harvnb|Pietrangeli|1986|p=28[/tpl][tpl]Citation|last=Monfasani|first=John|year=1983|title=A Description of the Sistine Chapel under Pope Sixtus IV|journal=Artibus et Historiae|volume=4|issue=7|pages=9–18|issn=0391-9064|url=http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/?menu=art&gdzie=artibusChapterResult&id=68|doi=10.2307/1483178|publisher=IRSA s.c.|postscript=.|jstor=1483178 [/tpl]

The texts are written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Nabataean, mostly on parchment but with some written on papyrus and bronze.From papyrus to cyberspace ''The Guardian 27 August 2008. The manuscripts have been dated to various ranges between 408 BCE and 318 CE.Doudna, Greg, "Dating the Scrolls on the Basis of Radiocarbon Analysis", in The Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years, edited by Flint Peter W., and VanderKam, James C., Vol.1 (Leiden: Brill, 1998) 430–471.

The scrolls have traditionally been identified with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, although some recent interpretations have challenged this association and argue that the scrolls were penned by priests in Jerusalem, Zadokites, or other unknown Jewish groups.Ilani, Ofri, "Scholar: The Essenes, Dead Sea Scroll 'authors,' never existed", Ha'aretz, 13 March 2009.Golb, Norman, "On the Jerusalem Origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls", University of Chicago Oriental Institute, 5 June 2009.
Due to the poor condition of some of the Scrolls, not all of them have been identified. Those that have been identified can be divided into three general groups: (1) some 40% of them are copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible, (2) approximately another 30% of them are texts from the Second Temple Period and which ultimately were not canonized in the Hebrew Bible, like the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, the Book of Tobit, the Wisdom of Sirach, Psalms 152–155, etc., and (3) the remaining roughly 30% of them are sectarian manuscripts of previously unknown documents that shed light on the rules and beliefs of a particular group or groups within greater Judaism, like the Community Rule, the War Scroll, the Pesher on Habakkuk and The Rule of the Blessing.Abegg, Jr., Martin, Peter Flint, and Eugene Ulrich, The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English, San Francisco: Harper, 2002.

The laws were maintained in written form in the Latin language by a committee empowered by the monarch. Dozens of manuscripts dated from the 8th century of a putative original recension in the 6th century and three emendations as late as the 9th century have survived.[tpl]harvnb|Drew|1991|page=53[/tpl].
Salic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing inheritance, and criminal law, such as the punishment for murder. It has had a formative influence on the tradition of statute law that has extended to modern times in Central Europe, especially in the German states, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, parts of Italy, Austria and Hungary, Romania, and the Balkans.

[[Law of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Law in the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom has three legal systems."The UK has three legal systems, operating in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland", direct.gov.uk, accessed 12 March 2007 English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law, which applies in Northern Ireland, are based on common-law principles. Scots law, which applies in Scotland, is a pluralistic system based on civil-law principles, with common law elements dating back to the High Middle Ages. While England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland diverge in the more detailed rules of common law and equity, and while there are certain fields of legislative competence devolved in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and London, there are substantive fields of law which apply across the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system since it was created by the political union of previously independent countries. Article 19 of the Treaty of Union, put into effect by the Acts of Union in 1707, created the Kingdom of Great Britain but guaranteed the continued existence of Scotland's separate legal system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html|title=The Treaty (act) of the Union of Parliament 1706|publisher=Scottish History Online|accessdate=5 October 2008[/tpl] The Acts of Union of 1800, which combined Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, contained no equivalent provisions but preserved the principle of separate courts to be held in Ireland, of which the part called Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom.

Retrieved on 22 May 2006 In England and Wales, the court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Courts of Northern Ireland follow the same pattern.  In Scotland the chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of Justiciary, for criminal cases.  Sheriff courts have no equivalent outside Scotland, as they deal with both criminal and civil caseloads.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the highest court of appeal for several independent Commonwealth countries, the British overseas territories, and the British Crown dependencies. There are also immigration courts with UK-wide jurisdiction — the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and Special Immigration Appeals Commission. The Employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal have jurisdiction throughout Great Britain, but not Northern Ireland.

Emil Christian Hansen (May 8, 1842 – August 27, 1909) was a Danish mycologist and fermentation physiologist.
Born in Ribe, he financed his education by writing novels. He was awarded a gold medal in 1876 for an essay on fungi, titled De danske Gjødningssvampe.Encyclopedia.com (biography)  During his days as a university student in Copenhagen, he worked as an unpaid assistant to zoologist Japetus Steenstrup (1813–1897). In 1876, with Alfred Jørgensen (1848–1925), he published a Danish translation of Charles Darwin’s "The Voyage of the Beagle"; Rejse om Jorden. From 1879 to 1909, he was director of the physiological department at Carlsberg Laboratory.Darwinarkivet (biographical information)
Employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, he discovered that yeast was composed of different kinds of fungi and that the yeast culture could be cultivated. He isolated a pure cell of yeast, and after combining it with a sugary solution, produced more yeast than was in a yeast bank. It was known as Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, and is used in lager beers.NCBI The dynamics of the Saccharomyces carlsbergensis brewing yeast transcriptome See Fermentation, Yeast.

[[Direct-broadcast satellite]]

CATEGORIES: Satellite broadcasting, Television terminology, Pay television

Direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) is a term used to refer to satellite television broadcasts intended for home reception.[tpl]cite journal |title=Direct Broadcast Satellite ABC|url=http://dish-cable.com/DBS.htm|journal=http://dish-cable.com[/tpl]
A designation broader than DBS would be direct-to-home signals, or DTH.[tpl]cite journal |title=A New Generation of Television In America|url=http://members.tripod.com/~antennas_muchmore/dbsfaq.htm|journal=http://members.tripod.com|date = 14 January 1998[/tpl] This has initially distinguished the transmissions directly intended for home viewers from cable television distribution services that are sometimes carried on the same satellite. The term DTH predates DBS and is often used in reference to services carried by lower power satellites which required larger dishes (1.7 m diameter or greater) for reception.
In Europe, prior to the launch of Astra 1A in 1988, the term DBS was commonly used to describe the nationally commissioned satellites planned and launched to provide television broadcasts to the home within several European countries (such as BSB in the United Kingdom and TV-Sat in Germany). These services were to use the D-Mac and D2-Mac format and BSS frequencies with circular polarization from orbital positions allocated to each country. Before these DBS satellites, home satellite television in Europe was limited to a few channels, really intended for cable distribution, and requiring dishes typically of 1.2m.
SES launched the Astra 1A satellite to provide services to homes across Europe receivable on dishes of just 60-80 cm and, although these mostly used PAL video format and FSS frequencies with linear polarization, the DBS name slowly came to applied to all Astra satellites and services too.

All Fours, also known as High-Low-Jack or Seven Up, is an English tavern trick-taking card game that was popular as a gambling game until the end of the 19th century. It is the eponymous and earliest recorded game in a family that flourished most in 19th century North America, notable other members being Auction Pitch, Pedro and Cinch, which competed against Poker and Euchre. Nowadays the original game is especially popular in the Caribbean, but a simpler variant has also survived in parts of England.[tpl]harvnb|Parlett|1990[/tpl].
Each player is dealt six cards. In trick play, players are allowed to trump instead of following suit. The title refers to the possibility of winning four game points by being dealt both the highest and the lowest trump in play, capturing the Jack of trumps and winning the greatest number of card-points.[tpl]harvnb|Parlett|1992[/tpl].

This symbol refers to "K-under" (originally [tpl]lang-de|Kurz-unter[/tpl])—in other words, the band directly below the K-band.  In radar applications, it ranges from 12-18 GHz according to the formal definition of radar frequency band nomenclature in IEEE Standard 521-2002.IEEE Std 521 - 2002 URL only available to IEEE membersNote that in the band 11.2–12 GHz the working definitions of Ku band and X band overlap; satellite communications engineers would generally regard frequencies above 11.2 GHz as being part of the Ku band.
Ku band is primarily used for satellite communications, most notably for fixed and broadcast services, and for specific applications such as NASA's Tracking Data Relay Satellite used for both space shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) communications.  Ku band satellites are also used for backhauls and particularly for satellite from remote locations back to a television network's studio for editing and broadcasting.  The band is split into multiple segments that vary by geographical region by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). NBC was the first television network to uplink a majority of its affiliate feeds via Ku band in 1983.
Some frequencies in this radio band are used for vehicle speed detection by law enforcement, especially in Europe.Radar Detectors Glossary

The amusement park is the oldest in Barcelona and still has most of the original rides, some of which date to the turn of the 20th century. The park was featured in the Woody Allen film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona.    
Tibidabo can be reached by funicular railway, bus, bicycle, or car. The railway, built in 1901, was the first of its kind in Spain.

C-SPAN ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|s|p|æ|n[/tpl]), an acronym for Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network, is a private, nonprofit American cable television network, created in 1979 by the cable television industry as a public service that televises many proceedings of the federal government, as well as other public affairs programming. The C-SPAN network includes three television channels (C-SPAN, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3), one radio station and a group of websites that provide streaming media and archives of C-SPAN programs. C-SPAN's television channels are available to approximately 100 million cable and satellite households within the United States, while WCSP-FM, also called C-SPAN Radio, is broadcast on FM radio in Washington, D.C., and is available throughout the U.S. on XM Satellite Radio, via Internet streaming, and through apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices.
The network televises U.S. political events, particularly live and "gavel-to-gavel" coverage of the U.S. Congress as well as occasional proceedings of the Canadian and British Parliaments and major events worldwide.

Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy. C-SPAN is a nonprofit organization, funded by a 6-cent per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates, and does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has control of the content of its programming.

El Carmel ([tpl]IPA-ca|əɫ kərˈmɛɫ[/tpl]), or simply Carmel, is a neighbourhood in the district of Horta-Guinardó, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
Carmel is in the municipal district of Horta-Guinardó.  The area was developed mainly in the 60s and 70s when immigrant workers, encouraged to move to Barcelona by the government of the dictator Francisco Franco built housing for themselves.  The combination of houses, then isolated on the rural hillside of what is now El Parc Tres Turons, ad hoc buildings put up without building permits and more planned urban development has given the area its modern appearance of many buildings piled on the hillside.  Many bars run by the original immigrants from other parts of Spain still serve delicacies from those regions.
Carmel became infamous in 2005 when there was a major tunnel construction accident.  It brought to a halt the expansion works on line 5 of the Barcelona Metro and led to the evacuation of dozens of buildings in the area.  Local residents protested and most of those evacuated to other areas have finally been rehoused and a new school opened.  The Barcelona City Council has pledged more investment in the area to improve transport, accessibility and services.
Further bad news came when bus crash on 20 September 2008 in the neighbourhood, resulted in the death of two people - a young girl and an elderly woman.

William Morris Davis (February 12, 1850 - February 5, 1934) was an American geographer, geologist, geomorphologist, and meteorologist, often called the "father of American geography".
He was born into a Quaker family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Edward M. Davis and Maria Mott Davis (a daughter of the women's advocate Lucretia Mott). He graduated from Harvard University in 1869 and received a Master of Engineering in the following year.  
He then worked in Córdoba, Argentina for three years, then after working as an assistant to Nathaniel Shaler, he became an instructor in geology at Harvard, in 1879. (Davis never completed his PhD.) He married Ellen B. Warner of Springfield, Massachusetts in the same year.
His most influential scientific contribution was the cycle of erosion, first defined around 1884, which was a model of how rivers create landforms. His cycle of erosion suggests that (larger) rivers have three main sections: upper course, middle course, and lower course - each of which has distinct landforms and other properties associated with it.
Though it was a crucial early contribution to geomorphology, many of Davis' theories regarding landscape evolution, sometimes known as Davisian geomorphology, have been heavily criticized by modern geomorphologists. Also criticized were his tendency to go after and discredit geomorphologists who disagreed with his ideas and methods. In fact, until he retired, he had the study of landscape evolution almost monopolized.
In modern times, the accusation of someone using Davisian geomorphology is sometimes used when attempting to discredit the scientific papers of others.
He was a founder of the Association of American Geographers in 1904, and heavily involved with the National Geographic Society in its early years, writing a number of articles for the magazine.
Davis retired from Harvard in 1911. After his first wife died, Davis married Mary M. Wyman of Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1914, and, after her death, he married  Lucy L. Tennant of Milton, Massachusetts 
in 1928, who survived him.
He died in Pasadena, California, shortly before his 84th birthday.  His Cambridge home is a National Historic Landmark.

It is the third-largest city by population in North Carolina and the largest city in Guilford County and the surrounding Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. According to the 2012 U.S. Census Estimate, Greensboro's population is 277,080. It is located at the intersection of three major interstate highways (Interstate 85, Interstate 40 and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina.
In 2003, the previous Greensboro – Winston-Salem – High Point metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was re-defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, resulting in the formation of the Greensboro-High Point MSA and the Winston-Salem MSA. The 2010 population for the Greensboro-High Point MSA was 723,801. The Greensboro – Winston-Salem – High Point combined statistical area (CSA), popularly referred to as the Piedmont Triad, had a population of 1,599,477.
In 1808, Greensborough (as was the spelling prior to 1895) was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed the nearby town of Guilford Court House as the county seat. This act moved the county courts closer to the geographical center of the county, a location more easily reached by the majority of the county's citizens.

[[Modern Western square dance]]

CATEGORIES: Square dance, American folk dances

Modern Western square dance (also called Western square dance, contemporary Western square dance, modern American square dance or modern square dance) is one of two American types of square dancing, along with traditional square dance.  As a dance form, modern Western square dance grew out of traditional Western dance.  The term "Western square dance", for some, is synonymous with "cowboy dance" or traditional Western square dance.  Therefore this article uses the term "modern Western square dance" to describe the contemporary non-historical dance which grew out of the traditional dance.
Modern Western square dance, like traditional square dance, is directed by a square dance caller.  In modern Western square dance the caller strings together a sequence of individual square dance calls to make a figure or sequence.  These calls are the building blocks of the choreography that is danced by the individuals, square dancers, in the squares.  There are eight people (four couples) in each square; at a dance there may be many squares.  Generally speaking, each of these squares dances independently of each other, with the exception of specialty or "gimmick" dances, where there might be some crossover of dancers from one square to another.
The square functions as a "dance team" for the duration of a square dance tip, a group of dances usually separated from the next tip by a pause during which the dancers regroup into new squares.  A square dance tip is usually composed of a combination of patter calls and singing calls, the two types of square dance calls.

However, it has been demonstrated that this name actually means "Tarasis, son of Kodisa, from Rusumblada", and that "Tarasis" was a common name in Isauria (R.M. Harrison, "The Emperor Zeno's Real Name", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 74 (1981) 27–28). [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|r|ə|s|ɨ|s[/tpl], was Byzantine Emperor from 474 to 475 and again from 476 to 491. Domestic revolts and religious dissension plagued his reign, which nevertheless succeeded to some extent in foreign issues. His reign saw the end of the Western Roman Empire under Julius Nepos, but he contributed much to stabilizing the eastern Empire.
In ecclesiastical history, Zeno is associated with the Henotikon or "instrument of union", promulgated by him and signed by all the Eastern bishops, with the design of solving the monophysite controversy.

In music, timbre ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|m|b|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|TAM|bər[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|m|b|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|TIM|bər[/tpl]) also known as tone color or tone quality from psychoacoustics, is the quality of a musical note or sound or tone that distinguishes different types of sound production, such as voices and musical instruments, string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments. The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include spectrum and envelope. 
In simple terms, timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For instance, it is the difference between a guitar and a piano playing the same note at the same loudness. Experienced musicians are able to distinguish between different instruments based on their varied timbres, even if those instruments are playing notes at the same pitch and loudness.

CATEGORIES: Microwave bands, Satellite broadcasting

The C band is a name given to certain portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including wavelengths of microwaves that are used for long-distance radio telecommunications. The IEEE C-band (4 GHz to 8 GHz) - and its slight variations - contains frequency ranges that are used for many satellite communications transmissions, some Wi-Fi devices, some cordless telephones, and some weather radar systems. For satellite communications, the microwave frequencies of the C-band perform better under adverse weather conditions in comparison with Ku band (11.2 GHz to 14.5 GHz) microwave frequencies, which are used by other communication satellites.What is C Band page from tech-faq (accessed Aug. 14, 2008) The adverse weather conditions, collectively referred to as rain fade, all have to do with moisture in the air, including rain and snow.

[[Television receive-only]]

CATEGORIES: Television technology, Broadcast engineering, Radio frequency antenna types, Satellite television, History of television, Television terminology

Television receive-only (TVRO) and big ugly dish (BUD), is a term used in North America to refer to the reception of satellite television from FSS-type satellites, generally on C-band analog; free-to-air and unconnected to a commercial DBS provider. TVRO systems rely on feeds being transmitted unencrypted and using open-standards, which heavily contrasts to DBS systems in the region.
TVRO was once the sole, and later the main means of consumer satellite reception in the United States, until the mid-1990s and the arrival of services such as PrimeStar, USSB, DirecTV and Dish Network. While these services are at least theoretically based on open standards (DVB-S, MPEG-2, MPEG-4), the majority of services are encrypted and require proprietary decoder hardware.
The term is rarely used in recent times due to the general move towards pay television and subscription-based DBS services like DirecTV, Dish Network, Bell TV, and Sky TV, although it is still sometimes used to refer to receiving digital television "backhaul" feeds from FSS-type satellites. Reception of free-to-air satellite signals, generally Ku band Digital Video Broadcasting, for home viewing is still common in Europe, India and Australia, although the TVRO nomenclature was never used there. Free-to-air satellite signals are also very common in the People's Republic of China, as many rural locations cannot receive cable television and solely rely on satellites to deliver television signals to individual homes.

[[Bree (Middle-earth)]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth cities and towns

Bree is a fictional village in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, east of the Shire and south of Fornost Erain. It was inspired by the Buckinghamshire village of Brill, which Tolkien visited regularly in his early years at Oxford."Bree ... was based on Brilll ... a place which he knew well": Christopher Tolkien (1988), The Return of the Shadow (being vol.VI of The History of Middle-earth), ch.VII, p.131, note 6, ISBN 0-04-440162-0 (Supposedly Tolkien also lived in Brill for a short while.)Tom Shippey, Tolkien and Iceland: The Philology of Envy
Bree was a very ancient settlement of men in Eriador, long established by the time of the Third Age of Middle-earth.  After the collapse of the kingdom of Arthedain, Bree continued to thrive without any central authority or government for many centuries.  As Bree lies at the meeting of two large roadways, the Great East Road and the (now disused) Greenway, it had for centuries been a centre of trade and a stopping place for travellers, though as Arnor in the north waned Bree's prosperity and size declined.
Tolkien wrote of two different origins for the people of Bree. One was that Bree had been founded and populated by men of the Edain who did not reach Beleriand in the first age, remaining east of the mountains in Eriador.  The other that they were stemming instead from the same stock as the Dunlendings."At the Sign of the Prancing Pony" in The Fellowship of the Ring and Appendix F in The Return of the King.
These two origins are not completely contradictory as the Dunlendings were descended from the Haladin who were counted the second house of the Edain.
By the time of the War of the Ring Bree was the westernmost settlement of men in Middle-earth, and there was no other settlement of men within a hundred leagues of the Shire.The Fellowship of the Ring, "At the Sign of the Prancing Pony", p. 161.  A day's ride east along the road lay The Forsaken Inn, according to Aragorn, although nothing more is known of it.
Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield met by coincidence in Bree, setting in motion the events recounted in The Hobbit. Both were interested in the dragon Smaug at the Lonely Mountain.  Together they planned the Quest of Erebor, which resulted in the death of Smaug and the finding of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins.

DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol.
DECnet was built right into the DEC flagship operating system VMS since its inception. Later Digital ported it to Ultrix, as well as Apple Macintosh and IBM PC running variants of DOS and Microsoft Windows under the name DEC Pathworks, allowing these systems to connect to DECnet networks of VAX machines as terminal nodes. More recently, an open-source version has been developed for GNU/Linux.Linux-DECnet DECnet code in the Linux kernel was marked as orphaned on February 18, 2010.Linux Kernel Changelog, 2010-02-18.

Building on the achievements of his father, Cennétig mac Lorcain, and especially his elder brother, Mathgamain, Brian first made himself King of Munster, then subjugated Leinster, eventually becoming King of All Ireland. He is the founder of the O'Brien dynasty.
With a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains.Donnchadh O Corrain, Ireland before the Normans (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972) The Uí Néill king Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the Cenél nEógain and Cenél Conaill, acknowledged Brian as High King at Athlone in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern Uí Néill, who refused to accept his claims, against Leinster, where resistance was frequent, and against the Norse Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin. Brian's hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally Máel Sechnaill was attacked by the Cenél nEógain king Flaithbertach Ua Néill, with the Ulstermen as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on Máel Sechnaill by the Dubliners under their king Sihtric Silkbeard and the Leinstermen led by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, Brian's armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin at Clontarf near Dublin on Good Friday. The resulting Battle of Clontarf was a bloody affair, with Brian, his son Murchad, and Máel Mórda among those killed. The list of the noble dead in the Annals of Ulster includes Irish kings, Norse Gaels, Scotsmen, and Scandinavians. The immediate beneficiary of the slaughter was Máel Sechnaill who resumed his interrupted reign. The Norse Gaels and Scandinavians too produced works magnifying Brian, among these Njal's Saga, the Orkneyinga Saga, and the now-lost Brian's Saga. Brian's war against Máel Mórda and Sihtric was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to Gormlaith, Máel Mórda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of Amlaíb Cuarán, king of Dublin and York, then of Máel Sechnaill, and finally of Brian.

Pitch is a perceptual property that allows the ordering of sounds on a frequency-related scale.[ref]

</ref>
Pitches are compared as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies,[ref]

</ref> 
which require sound whose frequency is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise.[ref]

Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.[ref]

Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.[tpl]Cite book| title = Signals, Sound, and Sensation | last= Hartmann |first= William Morris| publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-56396-283-7 | pages = 145, 284, 287 | url = http://books.google.at/books?id=3N72rIoTHiEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=William+M.+Hartmann[/tpl]

Lughnasadh or Lughnasa (pronounced [tpl]respell|LOO|nə-sə[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ga|Lúnasa[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-gd|Lùnastal[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-gv|Luanistyn[/tpl]) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season that was historically observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Originally it was held on 31 July – 1 August, or approximately halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. However, over time the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals; along with Samhain, Imbolc and Beltane. It corresponds to other European harvest festivals, such as the Welsh Calan Awst and the English Lammas.
Lughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and is believed to have pagan origins. The festival itself is named after the god Lugh. It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies, ritual athletic contests (most notably the Tailteann Games), feasting, matchmaking and trading. There were also visits to holy wells. According to folklorist Máire MacNeill, evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the first of the corn, a feast of the new food and of bilberries, the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play. Much of this would have taken place on top of hills and mountains.
Lughnasadh customs persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being variously named 'Garland Sunday', 'Bilberry Sunday', 'Mountain Sunday' and 'Crom Dubh Sunday'. The custom of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas, although it has been re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the 'Reek Sunday' pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday in July. A number of fairs are also believed to be survivals of Lughnasadh, for example the Puck Fair. Since the latter 20th century, Celtic neopagans have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, elements of the festival have been revived as a cultural event.

In Greek mythology, the Hesperides ([tpl]IPAc-en|h|ɛ|ˈ|s|p|ɛr|ɪ|d|iː|z[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἑσπερίδες[/tpl]) are nymphs who tend a blissful garden in a far western corner of the world, located near the neighbourhood of CyreneDictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology or Benghazitheoi.com in Libya or the Atlas mountains in North Africa at the edge of the encircling Oceanus, the world-ocean.A confusion of the Garden of the Hesperides with an equally idyllic Arcadia is a modern one, conflating Sir Philip Sidney's Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia and Robert Herrick's Hesperides: both are viewed by Renaissance poets as oases of bliss, but they were not connected by the Greeks. The development of Arcadia as an imagined setting for pastoral is the contribution of Theocritus to Hellenistic culture: see Arcadia (utopia).  The nymphs are said to be the daughters of Hesperus.Servius. ad Aen. 4,484.
According to the Sicilian Greek poet Stesichorus, in his poem the "Song of Geryon", and the Greek geographer Strabo, in his book Geographika (volume III), the garden of the Hesperides is located in Tartessos, a location placed in the south of the Iberian peninsula.
By Ancient Roman times,[tpl]when|date=December 2011[/tpl] the garden of the Hesperides had lost its archaic place in religion and had dwindled to a poetic convention, in which form it was revived in Renaissance poetry, to refer both to the garden and to the nymphs that dwelt there.

[[Comateens]]

CATEGORIES: American New Wave musical groups, Musical groups from New York, Musical groups established in 1978

The Comateens were originally a new wave duo formed in 1978 in New York City by bassist/vocalist Nic North and guitarist Ramona Jan. Soon after, Lyn Byrd joined on vocals and synthesiser, and the duo became a trio. When Jan departed in 1980, North's brother Oliver joined on guitar, completing the final lineup. 
They contributed two tracks to the influential Marty Thau Presents 2x5 compilation and their debut album, the self-titled Comateens, (1980) featured the band's bizarrely original compositions alongside covers of "Summer in the City" (The Lovin' Spoonful), "TVC 15" (David Bowie), and the theme song from TV's The Munsters. Pictures on a String, their first album for Virgin Records, followed in 1983 yielding the dance club hit "Get Off My Case". In 1984 the band released their final album, Deal with It, which featured live drums played by Chuck Sabo.
The band split up in 1985. Oliver North died in 1987 of asthma-related heart failure due to a heroin overdose. In 1988 Nic North (now Nicholas West) and Lyn Byrd recorded an album, West & Byrd, together. In 1990 the duo, again under the name Comateens, recorded the song "A Place For Me", an English language adaptation of the Julien Clerc song "Fais Moi Une Place", and it became a European hit. Virgin Records released a retrospective compilation of their music in 1991 called "One By One: Best Of Comateens" which has become a rare and much sought-after record among collectors of new wave music. In 1995, their video for "The Late Mistake" was mocked in a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head called "Top O'The Mountain".

Alpheus or Alpheios ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|f|iː|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἀλφειός[/tpl], meaning "whitish"), was in Greek mythology a river (the modern Alfeios River) and river-god.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard | authorlink = Leonhard Schmitz | title = Alpheias | editor = William Smith | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume = 1 | pages = 133–134 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0142.html[/tpl]
Like most river-gods, he is a son of Oceanus and Tethys.Hesiod, Theogony 338Pindar, Nemean Odes i. 1  Telegone, daughter of Pharis, bore his son, the king Orsilochus.Pausanias, Description of Greece 4.30.2 Through him, Alpheus was the grandfather of Diocles, and great-grandfather of a pair of soldiers, Crethon and Orsilochus, who were slain by Aeneas during the Trojan War.Homer, Iliad 5.45 
According to Pausanias, Alpheius was a passionate hunter and fell in love with the nymph Arethusa, but she fled from him to the island of Ortygia near Syracuse, and metamorphosed herself into a well, after which Alpheius became a river, which flowing from Peloponnesus under the sea to Ortygia, there united its waters with those of the well Arethusa.Pausanias, Description of Greece v. 7. § 2Comp. Scholiast on Pindar's Nemean Odes i. 3  This story is related somewhat differently by the Roman writer Ovid: Arethusa, a beautiful nymph, once while bathing in the river Alfeios in Arcadia, was surprised and pursued by the river god; but the goddess Artemis took pity upon her and changed her into a well, which flowed under the earth to the island of Ortygia.Ovid, Metamorphoses v. 572, &c.Comp. Serv. ad Virg. Ecl. x. 4Virgil, Aeneid iii. 694Statius, Silvae i. 2, 203Theb. i. 271, iv. 239Lucian, Dialogi Marini 3
According to yet other traditions, Artemis herself was the object of the love of Alpheius. Once, it is said, when pursued by him she fled to Letrini in Elis, and here she covered her face and those of her companions (nymphs) with mud, so that Alpheius could not discover or distinguish her, and was obliged to return.Pausanias, Description of Greece vi. 22. § 5  This occasioned the building of a temple of Artemis Alphaea at Letrini.  According to another version, the goddess fled to Ortygia, where she had likewise a temple under the name of Alphaea.Scholiast on Pindar's Pythian Odes ii. 12  An allusion to Alpheius' love of Artemis is also contained in the fact that at Olympia the two divinities had one altar in common.Pausanias, Description of Greece v. 14. § 5Scholiast on Pindar's Olympian Odes v. 10
In these accounts two or more distinct stories seem to be mixed up together, but they probably originated in the popular belief that there was a natural subterranean communication between the river Alpheios and the well Arethusa.  It was believed that a cup thrown into the Alpheius would make its reappearance in the well Arethusa in Ortygia.Strabo, Geographia vi. p. 270, viii. 343Seneca the Younger, Naturales quaestiones iii. 26Fulgent. Myth. iii. 12  Plutarch gives an account which is altogether unconnected with those mentioned above.Plutarch, de Fluv. 19  According to him, Alpheius was a son of Helios, and killed his brother Cercaphus in a contest. Haunted by despair and the Erinyes he leapt into the river Nyctimus which afterwards received the name Alpheius.
Alpheus was also the river which Hercules, in the fifth of his labours, re-routed in order to clean the filth from the Augean Stables in a single day, a task which had been presumed to be impossible.

In Greek mythology Danaus, or Danaos ([tpl]lang-grc|Δαναός[/tpl]), was the twin brother of Aegyptus and son of Achiroe and Belus, a mythical king of Egypt. The myth of Danaus is a foundation legend (or re-foundation legend) of Argos, one of the foremost Mycenaean cities of the Peloponnesus. In Homer's Iliad, "Danaans" ("tribe of Danaë") and "Argives" commonly designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans.

[[Lynceus]]
CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Kings of Argos

In Greek mythology, Lynceus[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-grc|Λυγκεύς[/tpl]) was a king of Argos, succeeding Danaus. He is named as a descendant of Belus through his father Aegyptus, who was the twin brother of Danaus. Danaus had fifty daughters, the Danaides, while Aegyptus had fifty sons including Lynceus, whose name when translated means "lynx-eyed" (from Latin). Aegyptus commanded that his sons marry the Danaides and Danaus fled to Argos, ruled by King Pelasgus with his daughters. When Aegyptus and his sons arrived to take the Danaides, Danaus gave them to spare the Argives the pain of a battle. However, he instructed his daughters to kill their husbands on their wedding night. Forty-nine followed through, but one, Hypermnestra refused because her husband, Lynceus, honored her wish to remain a virgin. Danaus was angry with his disobedient daughter and threw her to the Argive courts. Aphrodite intervened and saved her. Lynceus later killed Danaus as revenge for the death of his brothers. Lynceus and Hypermnestra then began a dynasty of Argive kings (the Danaid Dynasty) beginning with Abas. In some versions of the legend, the Danaides, minus Hypermnestra (or sometimes alternately Amymone) were punished in Tartarus by being forced to carry water through a jug with holes, or a sieve, so the water always leaked out.Bibliotheca Book I, Chapter VIII, p. 2 and Chapter 9, p. 16; Book III, Chapter X, p. 3 and Chapter IX, p. 2.Apollonius Rhodius.

[[Flag of Kiribati]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Kiribati, National flags, Flags adopted through competition, 1979 introductions

The flag of Kiribati is red in the upper half with a gold frigatebird (Fregata minor, in Gilbertese: te eitei) flying over a gold rising sun (otintaai), and the lower half is blue with three horizontal wavy white stripes to represent the ocean and the three groups (Gilbert, Phoenix and Line Islands). The 17 rays of the sun represent the 16 Gilbert Islands and Banaba (former Ocean Island).
The badge was designed by Sir Arthur Grimble in 1932 for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands British colony.
Kiribati's flag is an armorial banner, a flag having a design corresponding exactly to that of the shield in the coat of arms. 
The coat of arms dates back to May 1937 when it was granted to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, as Kiribati and Tuvalu were then known. The shield was incorporated into the centre of the fly half of a British Blue Ensign as the state ensign of the colony. 
Shortly before independence was granted in 1979, a local competition was held to choose a new national flag, and a design based on the colonial coat of arms was submitted to the College of Arms. The College of Arms decided to modify this design. Both the golden frigatebird and the sun were enlarged to occupy more of the top of the flag, and the width of the blue and white wavy bands was reduced. The local people, however, insisted on the original design, in which the top and bottom halves of the flag were equal, the sun and local frigate bird small, and the various design elements outlined in black. The new flag was hoisted during the independence day celebrations in the capital, Tarawa, on July 12, 1979. 
The frigatebird symbolises command of the sea, power, freedom and Kiribati cultural dance patterns[tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl], the blue and white wavy bands represent the Pacific Ocean, which surrounds Kiribati and the sun refers to Kiribati's position astride the Equator[tpl]fact|date=October 2011[/tpl].
The flag bears a very slight resemblance to the flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, as well as to the flag of British Columbia, and the flag of the Company of Scotland.

[[Tablet (pharmacy)]]
CATEGORIES: Chemical engineering, Pharmaceutical industry, Pharmacology, Drug delivery devices, Dosage forms

A tablet is a pharmaceutical dosage form.  It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance.
The compressed tablet is the most popular dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally or intravaginally.  The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions. Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter. Some tablets are in the shape of capsules, and are called "caplets". Other products are manufactured in the form of tablets which are designed to dissolve or disintegrate; e.g. cleaning and deodorizing products.
Medicinal tablets and capsules are often called "pills", though originally, "pill" referred specifically to a soft mass rolled into a ball shape, rather than a compressed powder.

Belgarath the Sorcerer is a book by David Eddings and Leigh Eddings.
Set in the same universe as the Eddings' The Belgariad and The Malloreon, it is effectively one big flashback (or a prequel) to the other series, although the framework story is set after the events of The Malloreon.
The book opens shortly after the end of The Malloreon with Belgarion, with help from Durnik, pestering Belgarath to write an autobiographical account of the events prior to The Belgariad. The core of the book is in the form of Belgarath's memoirs starting with his becoming an outcast from his village and becoming first disciple of the god Aldur and ending with the birth of Belgarion—a span of about seven thousand years.
Polgara the Sorceress is a companion book to Belgarath the Sorcerer which form the memoirs of Belgarath's elder daughter, Polgara.

The Treaty of Rome, officially the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (TEEC), is an international agreement that led to the founding of the European Economic Community (EEC) on 1 January 1958. It was signed on 25 March 1957 by  Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The word Economic was deleted from the treaty's name by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, and the treaty was repackaged as the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union on the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009.
The TEEC proposed the progressive reduction of customs duties and the establishment of a customs union. It proposed to create a common market of goods, workers, services and capital within the EEC's member states. It also proposed the creation of common transport and agriculture policies and a European social fund. It also established the European Commission.

Unlike the Beaufort, the Beaufighter had a long career and served in almost all theatres of war in the Second World War, first as a night fighter, then as a fighter bomber, eventually replacing the Beaufort as a torpedo bomber. A variant was built in Australia by the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP) and was known in Australia as the DAP Beaufighter.

From Russia, with Love is the fifth novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957. As with the first four books, From Russia, with Love was generally well received by the critics. The story was written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in early 1956. By the time the book was published, he did not know whether he wanted to write another Bond book or not.
The story centres on a plot by SMERSH, the Soviet counterintelligence agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation, the Secret Service. As bait for the plot, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in Istanbul and on the Orient Express.
The novel's sales were aided by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate and by the publication of a 1961 Life Magazine article, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. There have been four adaptations of the book: a serialisation in the Daily Express newspaper, a subsequent daily comic strip by Henry Gammidge and John McLusky in the same paper, the 1963 film version, and a 2012 BBC radio adaptation of the same name, produced by Jarvis & Ayres and starring Toby Stephens.

The Bristol Beaufort (manufacturer designation Type 152) was a British twin-engined torpedo bomber designed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and developed from experience gained designing and building the earlier Blenheim light bomber.Barnes 1988, p. 283.
Beauforts first saw service with Royal Air Force Coastal Command and then the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm from 1940. They were used as torpedo bombers, conventional bombers and mine-layers until 1942,Robertson 1976, p. 30. when they were removed from active service and were then used as trainer aircraft until being declared obsolete in 1945.Robertson 1976, pp.52-55. Beauforts also saw considerable action in the Mediterranean; Beaufort squadrons based in Egypt and on Malta helped put an end to Axis shipping supplying Rommel's Deutsches Afrikakorps in North Africa.
Beauforts saw their most extensive use with the  Royal Australian Air Force in the Pacific theatre, where they were used until the very end of the war. With the exception of six examples delivered from England, Australian Beauforts were locally produced under license.
Although designed as a torpedo-bomber, the Beaufort more often flew as a level-bomber. The Beaufort also flew more hours in training than on operational missions and more were lost through accidents and mechanical failures than were lost to enemy fire.Robertson 1976 p. 3. However, the Beaufort did spawn a long-range heavy fighter variant called the Beaufighter, which proved to be very successful and many Beaufort units eventually converted to the Beaufighter.Barnes 1988, p. 290.

Together they started the first computer company, the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), and pioneered fundamental computer concepts including the stored program, subroutines, and programming languages.  Their work, as exposed in the widely read First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC (1945) and as taught in the Moore School Lectures (1946), influenced an explosion of computer development in the late 1940s all over the world.

It is linked by the narrow (about 4 km) Strait of Kerch to the Black Sea to the south and is bounded in the north by mainland Ukraine, in the east by Russia, and in the west by the Crimean Peninsula. The Don and Kuban are the major rivers that flow into it. The Sea of Azov is the shallowest sea in the world, with the depth varying between [tpl]convert|0.9|m[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|14|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite book|quote=With a maximum depth of only about 46 feet (14 m), the Azov is the world's shallowest sea|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=1-59339-236-2|year=2005|page=758|volume=1[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aeBEAAAAMAAJ&q=Azov+%22shallowest+sea%22&dq=Azov+%22shallowest+sea%22|title=Academic American encyclopedia|volume=1|isbn=0-7172-2064-8|publisher=Grolier|year=1996|quote=The Azov is the world's shallowest sea, with depths ranging from 0.9 to 14 m (3 to 46 ft)|page=388[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7dWAAAAAMAAJ&q=Azov+%22shallowest+sea%22&dq=Azov+%22shallowest+sea%22|title=National Geographic|year=1994|volume=185|page=138|publisher=National Geographic Society[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop/EFS/photoinfo.pl?PHOTO=STS060-85-BT|title=Earth from space|publisher=NASA[/tpl] There is a constant outflow of water from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.
The sea is largely affected by the inflow of numerous rivers, which bring sand, silt, and shells, which in turn form numerous bays, limans, and narrow spits. Because of these deposits, the sea bottom is relatively smooth and flat with the depth gradually increasing toward the sea centre. Also, due to the river inflow, water in the sea has low salinity and a high content of biological matter, such as green algae that affects the water colour. Abundant plankton results in unusually high fish productivity. The sea shores and spits are low; they are rich in vegetation and bird colonies.

The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States in which its fifteen member universities compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division I, with its football teams competing in the  Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the highest levels for athletic competition in US-based collegiate sports. The ACC sponsors competition in twenty-five sports with many of its member institutions' athletic programs held in high regard nationally. ACC teams and athletes have claimed dozens of national championships in multiple sports throughout the conference's history. Generally, the ACC's top athletes and teams in any particular sport in a given year are considered to be among the top collegiate competitors in the nation.  The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate power conferences, all of which enjoy extensive media coverage and automatic qualifying for their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). With the advent of the College Football Playoff in 2014, the ACC will be one of five conferences with a contractual tie-in to an "access bowl", the successors to the BCS.
Founded in 1953 in Greensboro, North Carolina, by seven universities located in the South Atlantic States, the conference added additional members in late 1953, 1979, 1991, 2004, and 2013. The 2004 and 2013 additions extended the conference's footprint into the Northeast and Midwest. The most recent expansion in 2013 saw the additions of the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh, and Syracuse University. In 2012, the University of Maryland's Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference. On November 28, 2012, the ACC's Council of Presidents voted unanimously to invite the University of Louisville as a full member, replacing Maryland.[tpl]cite web|title=ACC Extends Formal Invitation for Membership to the University of Louisville|url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/112812aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|date=Nov 28, 2012|accessdate=Nov 28, 2012[/tpl]
ACC member universities represent a range of well-regarded private and public universities of various enrollment sizes, all of which participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Inter-institutional Academic Consortium (ACCIAC) whose purpose is to "enrich the educational missions, especially the undergraduate student experiences, of member universities".

[[Big East Conference (1979–2013)]]

CATEGORIES: Big East Conference, Sports in the Midwestern United States, Sports in the Eastern United States, Sports in the Southern United States, Organizations established in 1979, Organizations disestablished in 2013, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The Big East Conference was a collegiate athletics conference that consisted of as many as 16 universities in the eastern half of the United States from 1979 to 2013. The conference's members participated in 24 NCAA sports. Three members had football programs but were not Big East football schools: Notre Dame football was independent while Georgetown and Villanova competed in the Football Championship Subdivision. Another five schools—DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Providence—discontinued or did not have football programs.
In football, the Big East had all eight members play in bowl games since the 2005 realignment and had seven of eight teams ranked in the Top 25 since 2003. In that time, the Big East saw the emergence of new national players with West Virginia rising to as high as No. 1 and was ranked in the Top 10 for three-straight years (2005, 2006, 2007), South Florida rising as high as No. 2, Cincinnati and Louisville both as high as No. 3, Rutgers as high as No. 7, Pittsburgh as high as No. 9, and Connecticut as high as No. 13 in BCS standings. Also, Big East football saw an increase in attendance and enjoyed a new, $250 million plus television package that lasted through 2013.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/Attendance/2008.pdf |format=PDF| title=2008 NATIONAL COLLEGE FOOTBALL ATTENDANCE | publisher=NCAA | postscript=[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06338/743356-139.stm | title=ESPN's Thursday night football proves big to the Big East | publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=December 4, 2006[/tpl]
In basketball, Big East teams made 18 Final Four appearances and won seven NCAA Championships (UConn with three, Villanova, Georgetown, Syracuse, and Louisville with one each). Of the Big East's full members, all but South Florida attended the Final Four, the most of any conference,[tpl]cite news | url=http://ncaabasketball.fanhouse.com/2009/11/04/battle-for-big-east-gets-even-bigger/ | title=Battle for Big East Gets Even Bigger | publisher=NCAA Basketball Fanhouse[/tpl] though Marquette, DePaul, Notre Dame, Rutgers, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh made all their trips before joining the Big East. In 2011, the Big East set the record for the most teams sent to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship by a single conference with eleven out of their sixteen teams qualifying.
On July 1, 2013, as part of an ongoing realignment, the non-football playing schools (also known collectively as the Catholic 7) formed a non-football playing conference that retains the Big East Conference name.  The remaining six football-playing members joined with four schools from other conferences to become the American Athletic Conference. The American Athletic Conference is the legal successor of the old Big East; it retains the old Big East's structure and inherited the league's automatic berth in the Bowl Championship Series.  However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013.American Athletic Conference history(New) Big East Conference history
At the time of the announcement of the conference's break-up, its then-current football-playing members were all secular schools, with Syracuse being a secular private school and the rest being public-supported; in contrast, all the non-football members of the conference were Catholic schools.

Whirlwind I was a Cold War vacuum tube computer developed by the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory for the U.S. Navy.  It was amongst the first digital electronic computers that operated in real-time for output, and the first that was not simply an electronic replacement of older mechanical systems. Its development led directly to the Whirlwind II design used as the basis for the United States Air Force SAGE air defense system, and indirectly to almost all business computers and minicomputers in the 1960s.

[[Magnetic-core memory]]

CATEGORIES: Computer memory, Non-volatile memory, History of electronic engineering

Magnetic-core memory was the predominant form of random-access computer memory for 20 years (circa 1955–75). It uses tiny magnetic toroids (rings), the cores, through which wires are threaded to write and read information. Each core represents one bit of information. The cores can be magnetized in two different ways (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the bit stored in a core is zero or one depending on that core's magnetization direction. The wires are arranged to allow an individual core to be set to either a "one" or a "zero", and for its magnetization to be changed, by sending appropriate electric current pulses through selected wires. The process of reading the core causes the core to be reset to a "zero", thus erasing it. This is called destructive readout.
Such memory is often just called core memory, or, informally, core. Although core memory had been superseded by semiconductor memory by the end of the 1970s, memory is still occasionally called "core"; in particular, a file recording the contents of memory after a system error is usually called a core dump.

[[Light gun]]

CATEGORIES: Light guns

A light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games.
Modern screen-based light guns work by building a sensor into the gun itself, and the on-screen target(s) emit light rather than the gun. The first device of this type, the light pen, was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer.
The light gun and its ancestor, the light pen, are now rarely used as pointing devices due largely to the popularity of the mouse and changes in monitor display technology—conventional light guns only work with CRT monitors.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

[[Apomixis]]

CATEGORIES: Plant reproduction, Asexual reproduction

In botany, apomixis was defined by Hans Winkler as replacement of the normal sexual reproduction by asexual reproduction, without fertilization.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46760#page/313/mode/1up|author=Winkler, H.|year=1908|title=Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich|volume=2|issue=3|journal=Progressus Rei Botanicae|pages=293–454[/tpl] This definition notably does not mention meiosis. Thus "normal asexual reproduction" of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never been considered to be apomixis, but replacement of the seed by a plantlet or replacement of the flower by bulbils are types of apomixis. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant.
Some authors included all forms of asexual reproduction within apomixis, but that generalization of the term has since died out.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/16/suppl_1/S228.full|title=Understanding Apomixis: Recent Advances and Remaining Conundrums|author=Ross A. Bicknell and Anna M. Koltunow|journal=The Plant Cell|year=2004|volume=16|issue= suppl 1|pages=S228-S245[/tpl]
In flowering plants, the term "apomixis" is commonly used in a restricted sense to mean agamospermy, i.e. clonal reproduction through seeds. Although agamospermy could theoretically occur in gymnosperms, it appears to be absent in that group.
Apogamy is a related term that has had various meanings over time. In plants with independent gametophytes (notably ferns), the term is still used interchangeably with "apomixis", and both refer to the formation of sporophytes by parthenogenesis of gametophyte cells.
Male apomixis (paternal apomixis) involves replacement of the genetic material of the egg cell by that from the pollen.

The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star was the first jet fighter used operationally by the  United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).Green and Swanborough 2001, p. 345. Designed and built by Lockheed in 1943 and delivered just 143 days from the start of the design process, production models were flying but not ready for service by the end of World War II. Designed with straight wings, the type saw extensive combat in Korea with the United States Air Force (USAF) as the F-80. 
America's first successful turbojet-powered combat aircraft, it helped usher in the "jet age" in the USAF, but was outclassed with the appearance of the swept-wing transonic MiG-15 and quickly replaced in the air superiority role by the transonic North American F-86 Sabre. The F-94 Starfire, an all-weather interceptor on the same airframe, also saw Korean war service. The closely related T-33 Shooting Star trainer would remain in service with the U.S. Air Force and Navy until the 1970s and many still serve in a military role or are in private hands.

Milo Garrett Burcham (May 24, 1903 - October 20, 1944) was an American aviator. He worked as a stunt pilot, airshow pilot, and test pilot.
Burcham was born in Cadiz, Indiana, and grew up in Whittier, California in the eastern Los Angeles basin. Burcham sold burglar alarms of his own design to finance flying lessons from the O'Donnell School of Aviation in Long Beach, California, where he became chief instructor. In 1933, Burcham and Lt. Tito Falconi of the Italian Air Service competed in setting inverted flight endurance records. Burcham's flight of 4 h 5 min 22 s that December was not broken until July 24, 1991 when U.S. airshow pilot Joanne Osterud set a new world's record of 4 h 38 min 10 s. In 1936, Burcham flew his Boeing 100 to the World's Aerobatic Championship at the National Air Races in Los Angeles.
In 1941, Burcham joined Lockheed as a production test pilot and spent a year as chief pilot of Lockheed's operations in England. He became chief engineering test pilot a few years later, and in that capacity was served as copilot on the first flight of the Constellation on January 8, 1943. On January 9, 1944, he turned the first flight of Lulu-Belle, the XP-80 prototype, into a thrilling low-level airshow before a crowd of military and civilian VIPs at Muroc Army Air Base (now Edwards AFB).
On October 20, 1944 Burcham was killed in the flame-out on take-off of the engine of third production prototype YP-80 from Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank, California. Burcham is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

CATEGORIES: Interstate Highway System, Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania, Bald Eagle Valley, Nittany Valley

Interstate 99 (I-99) is an intrastate Interstate Highway located in central Pennsylvania in the United States. The southern terminus of the route is at exit 146 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70 and I-76) north of Bedford, where the road continues south as U.S. Route 220 (US 220). The northern terminus is at I-80 near Bellefonte. I-99 passes through Altoona and State College–the latter home to Pennsylvania State University–and is entirely concurrent to US 220. Long-term plans call for I-99 to be extended southward along the US 220 corridor to an interchange with I-68 in Cumberland, Maryland, and northward along the US 220 and US 15 corridors to an interchange with I-86 west of Corning, New York.
Unlike most Interstate Highway numbers, which were assigned by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to fit into a grid, I-99's number was written into Section 332 of the National Highway Designation Act of 1995 by Bud Shuster, then-chair of the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the bill's sponsor, and the representative of the district through which the highway runs. I-99 violates the AASHTO numbering convention associated with Interstate Highways, since it lies east of I-79 but west of I-81.

Interstate 5 (I-5) is the main Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States, running largely parallel to the Pacific Ocean,Union Pacific Railroad's former Southern Pacific's Coast Route and U.S. Highway 101 from Mexico to Canada (California to Washington). It serves some of the largest cities on the U.S. West Coast, including Seattle, Portland, Sacramento, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and also links the capital cities of Washington (Olympia), Oregon (Salem), and California (Sacramento) together. The highway's southern terminus is the Mexico–United States border and its northern terminus is the Canada–United States border; it is the only Interstate highway to touch the U.S. borders with both Canada and Mexico.  Upon crossing the Mexican border at its southern terminus, Interstate 5 continues to Tijuana, Baja California as Mexico Federal Highway 1. Upon crossing the Canadian border at its northern terminus, it continues to Vancouver as British Columbia Highway 99.
Interstate 5 links to control cities in California (San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Redding, Mount Shasta, Weed, and Yreka), Oregon (Ashland, Medford, Grants Pass, Roseburg, Eugene, Salem, and Portland), and Washington (Tacoma, Seattle, Everett, Mount Vernon, and Bellingham).  North of Seattle, the control city is Vancouver, British Columbia; it is signed as "Vancouver B.C." in order to avoid confusion with Vancouver, Washington.
One notable control city that Interstate 5 does not directly reach is San Francisco, which is about [tpl]convert|80|mi|km[/tpl] west of the highway. To the south, in the Tracy area, Interstate 580 splits from I-5 towards San Francisco, while to the north, near Vacaville, Interstate 505 cuts south to Interstate 80, which serves that city.

[[Interstate 97]]
CATEGORIES: Interstate Highway System, Interstate Highways in Maryland, Roads in Anne Arundel County, Maryland

Interstate 97 (I-97) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs entirely within Maryland. The intrastate Interstate runs [tpl]convert|17.62|mi|km[/tpl] from U.S. Route 50 and US 301 in Parole near Annapolis north to I-695 and I-895 in Brooklyn Park near Baltimore. I-97 is the shortest 2-digit mainline Interstate and the only intracounty 2-digit Interstate in the contiguous United States. The Interstate is the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. I-97 connects Annapolis with Baltimore–Washington International Airport and links the northern Anne Arundel County communities of Crownsville, Millersville, Severna Park, Glen Burnie, and Ferndale.
I-97 was constructed along the corridor of Maryland Route 3 (MD 3) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville. From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie, the Interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3, which was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s. North of there, the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass, a freeway built in the mid-1950s. The segment of I-97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two-lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s. The Interstate was introduced in 1979 after the state of Maryland successfully obtained Interstate mileage for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway from the federal government. The state decided to build the highway along I-97's current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor, which has partial freeway access via MD 10.
Construction on I-97 began in the late 1980s with new construction from US 50 and US 301 to Crownsville. The Crownsville–Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the Interstate and the MD 3–MD 32 junction was upgraded. The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to Interstate Highway standards in the early 1990s, after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville. I-97's interchange with I-695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid-1990s. The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid-2000s.

[[Graphics tablet]]
CATEGORIES: Computing input devices, Liquid crystal displays, Pointing devices

A graphics tablet or digitizer is a computer input device that enables a user to hand-draw images, animations and graphics, similar to the way a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the surface. Capturing data in this way, either by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes is called digitizing.
The device consists of a flat surface upon which the user may "draw" or trace an image using an attached stylus, a pen-like drawing apparatus. The image is displayed on the computer monitor, although some graphics tablets also have a screen.
Some tablets are intended as a replacement for the mouse as the primary pointing and navigation device for desktop computers.

Chris Austin Hadfield [tpl]post-nominals|country=CAN|OOnt|MSC (Mil.)|MSC (Civ.)|CD[/tpl] (born 29 August 1959) is a retired Canadian astronaut who was the first Canadian to walk in space. An Engineer and former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot, Hadfield has flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander of the International Space Station.
Hadfield, who was raised on a farm in southern Ontario, was inspired as a child when he watched the Apollo 11 Moon landing on TV. He attended high school in Oakville and Milton and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. He joined the Canadian Armed Forces and earned an engineering degree at Royal Military College. While in the military he learned to fly various types of aircraft and eventually became a test pilot and flew several experimental planes. As part of an exchange program with the United States Navy and United States Air Force, he obtained a master's degree in aviation systems at the University of Tennessee Space Institute.
In 1992, he was accepted into the Canadian astronaut program by the Canadian Space Agency. He first flew in space aboard STS-74 in November 1995 as a mission specialist. During the mission he visited the Russian space station Mir. In April 2001 he flew again on STS-100 and visited the International Space Station (ISS), where he walked in space and helped to install the Canadarm2. In December 2012 he flew for a third time aboard Soyuz TMA-07M and joined Expedition 34 on the ISS. He was a member of this expedition until March 2013 when he became the commander of the ISS as part of Expedition 35. He was responsible for a crew of five astronauts and helped to run dozens of scientific experiments dealing with the impact of low gravity on human biology. During the mission he also gained popularity by chronicling life aboard the space station and taking pictures of the earth and posting them through Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to a large following of people around the world. He was a guest on television news and talk shows and gained popularity by playing his guitar in space. His mission ended in May 2013 when he returned to earth. Shortly after returning, he announced his retirement, capping a 35-year career as a military pilot and an astronaut.

[[Foreign Sales Corporation]]

CATEGORIES: International trade

Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) was a means formerly provided by United States taxation law for US companies to receive a reduction in US federal income taxes for profits derived from exports, through the use of an offshore subsidiary (a "Foreign Sales Corporation").
The European Union (EU) launched proceedings against these provisions in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, claiming they were an export subsidy. In March 2000, the Appellate Body of the WTO found that the FSC provisions constituted a prohibited export subsidy under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round code on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM).Appellate Body Report, United States – Tax Treatment for "Foreign Sales Corporations", WT/DS108/AB/R, adopted 20 March 2000, DSR 2000:III, 1619 The US Congress then adopted in November 2000 the Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act (ETI; Public Law 106-519; 114 Stat. 2423), to repeal the FSC legislation and to introduce new provisions to exclude extraterritorial income from taxation.
The European Union challenged ETI in 2001, claiming it did not properly implement the earlier WTO decision - they argued it effectively retained the export subsidy, albeit under a different name. The WTO found the ETI to be a prohibited export subsidy. The US did not meet the deadline to implement this decision, and on 30 August 2002, the WTO approved the European Union request for over USD 4 billion in retaliatory tariffs. However, most observers view it as unlikely that the European Union will implement the sanctions, since the disruption that would cause to transatlantic trade would rebound on European companies; it is likely rather than the EU will seek to use the threat of sanctions as a bargaining chip to obtain concessions from the US in other areas.
The origins of the FSC dispute date back to 1971, when the US introduced legislation providing for "Domestic international sales corporations" (DISCs). These were challenged by the European Community under the GATT. The United States then counterclaimed that European tax regulations concerning extraterritorial income were also GATT-incompatible. In 1976, a GATT panel found that both DISCs and the European tax regulations were GATT-incompatible. However, these cases were settled by the Tokyo Round Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties (predecessor to today's SCM), and the GATT Council decided in 1981 to adopt the panel reports subject to the understanding that the terms of the settlement would apply. However, the WTO Panel in the 1999 case would later rule that the 1981 decision did not constitute a legal instrument within the meaning of GATT-1994, and hence was not binding on the panel.

Sketchpad (aka Robot Draftsman) was a revolutionary computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012.  It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[tpl]cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Andrew|last2=Jacko|first2=Julie A.|title=The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications, Second Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A8TPF_O385AC&pg=PA5|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=19 September 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4106-1586-2|page=5[/tpl] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided drafting (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general. For example, the graphical user interface (GUI) was derived from the Sketchpad as well as modern object oriented programming. Ivan Sutherland demonstrated with it that computer graphics could be used for both artistic and technical purposes in addition to showing a novel method of human-computer interaction.

The New Jersey Turnpike (shortened to NJTP and colloquially known to New Jerseyans as "the Turnpike") is a toll road in New Jersey, maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Turnpike is the nation's sixth-busiest toll road and is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the United States.[tpl]cite news |first= Dennis |last= Cauchon |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-01-27-tolls_N.htm |title= Drivers to see major toll hikes |accessdate=June 2, 2009 |date=January 27, 2008 |work=USA Today |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/600PIUX4s |archivedate= July 7, 2011[/tpl] Having a total of [tpl]convert|122.40|mi|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl], the Turnpike's southern terminus begins at Interstate 295 (I-295) near the border of Pennsville and Carneys Point Townships in Salem County, one mile east of the Delaware Memorial Bridge. Its northern terminus is located at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, Bergen County. The Turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey, as well as Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. The route divides into four roadways at exit 8A, with lanes restricted to carrying only cars, and with lanes for cars, trucks and buses.
The northern part of the mainline turnpike, along with the entirety of its extensions and spurs, is part of the Interstate Highway System, designated as Interstate 95 (I-95) between exit 6 and its northern end. South of exit 6, it has the unsigned Route 700 designation. There are two extensions and two spurs, including the Newark Bay Extension, which carries Interstate 78 (I-78); the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension (officially the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension); the Eastern Spur and the Western Spur. Construction of the mainline from conceptualization to completion took 23 months, from 1950 to 1952. It was officially opened to traffic in November 1951, between its southern terminus and exit 10.[tpl]cite news |last=  Blackwell |first= Jon |title= 1949: Highway of dreams |url= http://www.capitalcentury.com/1949.html |work=The Trentonian |accessdate=November 19, 2011[/tpl]

In optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the minimum capacity that, when removed in a specific way from the network, causes the situation that no flow can pass from the source to the sink.
The max-flow min-cut theorem is a special case of the duality theorem for linear programs and can be used to derive Menger's theorem and the König-Egerváry Theorem.

A jester was a historical entertainer either employed to entertain a ruler or other nobility in medieval or Tudor times or was an itinerant performer who entertained common folk at fairs and markets. With the resurgent interest in historical re-enactment and living history jesters have now become a common sight at modern medieval themed events. Jesters in medieval times are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and eccentric hats in a motley pattern and their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume. In medieval times jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills which could include songs, music, storytelling, acrobatics, juggling, and magic. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style and many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences.

HyperTalk is a high-level, procedural programming language created in 1987 by Dan Winkler and used in conjunction with Apple Computer's HyperCard hypermedia program by Bill Atkinson. The main target audience of HyperTalk was beginning programmers, hence HyperTalk programmers were usually called authors, and the process of writing programs was called "scripting". HyperTalk scripts are fairly similar to written English, and use a logic structure similar to the Pascal programming language.
The case-insensitive language was interpreted at first, but gained just-in-time compilation with HyperCard 2.0.Dave Kelly, "Tools of the Trade: CompileIt! 2.0!", MacTech, Vol. 7 No. 9 It supports the basic control structures of procedural languages: repeat for/while/until, if/then/else, as well as function and message "handler" calls (a handler is a subroutine, a message handler is a procedure). Data types are transparent to the user, conversion happens transparently in the background between strings and numbers. There are no classes or data structures in the traditional sense; their place was taken by special string literals, or rather "lists" of "items" delimited by commas (in later versions the "itemDelimiter" property allowed choosing an arbitrary character).

[[Pacific Northwest]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific Northwest, Geography of the Pacific Northwest, Regions of the Americas

The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW) is a region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and, loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into the coastal and mountainous regions of Northern California, and east into Idaho and western Montana, western Wyoming, and western Alberta, to the Continental Divide. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the Northwestern U.S. or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.
The Northwest Coast is the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest and the Northwest Plateau (also commonly known as "The Interior" in British Columbia[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interiorsavingscentre.com/index.shtml |title=Interior Savings Centre in Kamloops, British Columbia |publisher=Interiorsavingscentre.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18[/tpl] and the Inland Empire in the United States) is the inland regions. The term "Pacific Northwest" should not be confused with the Northwest Territory (also known as the Great Northwest, a historical term in the United States) or the Northwest Territories of Canada.
The region's largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle, Washington, with 3.9 million people;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/Metro/Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue-Washington.aspx |title=Best Places to Live in Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington Metro Area (WA) |publisher=Bestplaces.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18[/tpl] Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, with 2.4 million people;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/DEMO05A-eng.htm |title=Statistics Canada: Population of census metropoitan areas[/tpl] and Greater Portland, Oregon, with 2.2 million people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business.gov/states/oregon/local/portland.html|title=Doing Business In Portland, Oregon|work=Business.GOV[/tpl]
A key aspect of the Pacific Northwest is the US–Canada international border, which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region's inhabitants were composed mostly of Indigenous peoples. The border — in two sections, along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and the Alaska Panhandle west of northern British Columbia — has had a powerful effect on the region. According to Canadian historian Ken Coates, the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest—rather, "the region's history and character have been determined by the boundary".

[[Rodeo]]

CATEGORIES: Rodeo, Bullfighting, Spanish words and phrases

Rodeo ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|d|iː|oʊ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|r|oʊ|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|oʊ[/tpl]) is a competitive sport which arose out of the working practices of cattle herding in Spain, Mexico, and later the United States, Canada, South America, Australia and New Zealand. It was based on the skills required of the working vaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western Canada, and northern Mexico. Today it is a sporting event that consists of events that involve horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and speed of the human cowboy and cowgirl athletes who participate. American style professional rodeos generally comprise the following events: tie-down roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding and barrel racing.  The events are divided into two basic categories: the rough stock events and the timed events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region, other events such as breakaway roping, goat tying, or pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos.
American rodeo, particularly popular today within the Canadian province of Alberta and throughout the western United States, is the official state sport of Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas.  The iconic silhouette image of a "Bucking Horse and Rider" is a federal and state-registered trademark of the State of Wyoming.General Wyoming Information, web site accessed July 12, 2007 at http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/wy_symb.htm The Legislative Assembly of Alberta has considered making American rodeo the official sport of that province. However, enabling legislation has yet to be passed.
In the United States, professional rodeos are governed and sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA), while other associations govern children's, high school, collegiate, and senior rodeos.  Associations also exist for Native Americans and other minority groups.  The traditional season for competitive rodeo runs from spring through fall, while the modern professional rodeo circuit runs longer, and concludes with the PRCA National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada, now held in December.
Rodeo has provoked opposition from animal rights and animal welfare advocates, who argue that various competitions constitute animal cruelty. The American rodeo industry has made progress in improving the welfare of rodeo animals, with specific requirements for veterinary care and other regulations that protect rodeo animals. However, rodeo is opposed by a number of animal welfare organizations in the United States and Canada.  Some local and state governments in North America have banned or restricted rodeos, certain rodeo events, or types of equipment.  Internationally, rodeo is banned in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands,Rodeo: animal abuse for the sake of entertainment, Vancouver Humane Society, accessed April 2, 2009. with other European nations placing restrictions on certain practices.

[[Harpy]]

CATEGORIES: Pejorative terms for people, Human-headed_mythical_creatures, Greek legendary creatures, Greek mythology, Legendary birds, Mythological human hybrids

In Greek mythology and Roman mythology, a harpy ([tpl]Lang-el|ἅρπυια[/tpl], harpyia, [tpl]IPA-el|hárpuja|pron[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-lat|harpeia[/tpl]) were female monsters in the form of birds with human faces, together known as the Harpies. They steal food from their victims while they are eating and carry evildoers (especially those who have killed their family) to the Erinyes. They seem originally to have been wind spirites. In any event, their name means "snatchers".Adrian Room, Who's Who in Classical Mythology, p. 147 ISBN 0-517-22256-6
Homer knew of a harpy was the mother of the two horses of Achilles sired by the West Wind Zephyros.Iliad xvi. 150.
Hesiod calls them two "lovely-haired" creatures, the daughters of Thaumas and Electra, were sister of the Iris.Hesiod, Theogony, 265-267. Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Harpies as ugly winged bird-women, e.g. in Aeschylus' The Eumenides (line 50) are a late development. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness.Virgil, Aeneid iii. 216; Ovid Metamorphoses vii.4, Fasti vi. 132; Hyginus, Fabula 14; Johannes Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron 653;

[[Phineus]]

CATEGORIES: Phoenician characters in Greek mythology, Mythological kings of Thrace, Argonauts, Mythological Greek seers

In Greek mythology, Phineus[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-grc|Φινεύς[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-el|pʰiːněws|[/tpl])The name is occasionally rendered "Phineas" in popular culture, as in the film Jason and the Argonauts. "Phineus" may be associated with the ancient city of Phinea (or Phineopolis) on the Thracian Bosphorus.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] was a king of Thrace and seer who appears in accounts of the Argonauts' voyage.[tpl]harvtxt|Bremmer|1996[/tpl], [tpl]harvtxt|Dräger|2007[/tpl]. Several different versions of Phineus's parentage were presented in ancient texts. According to Apollonius of Rhodes, he was a son of Agenor, but the Bibliotheca says that other authors named his father as Poseidon (who is the father of Agenor).Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 2. 236–7; Bibliotheca 1. 9. 21 The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women, on the other hand, reported that Phineus was the son of Phoenix and Cassiopeia.Catalogue fr. 138 ([tpl]harvnb|Merkelbach|West|1967[/tpl]). His first wife was Cleopatra, daughter of Boreas and Oreithyia, by whom he had a pair of sons, named either Plexippus and Pandion,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3. 15. 3 or Gerymbas and Aspondus,Scholia on Sophocles, Antigone, 981, 989 ed. Brunck or Polydector and (?) Polydophus,Scholia on Ovid, Ibis, 273 or Parthenius and Crambus.Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 140[tpl]harvtxt|Dräger|2007[/tpl] His second wife Idaea, daughter of Dardanus (less commonly Eidothea, sister of Cadmus,Scholia on Sophocles, Antigone, 989 or EurytiaScholia on Odyssey, 12. 69), deceived him into blinding these sons, a fate Phineus himself would suffer.Scholia to Argonautica 2.178; cf. Sophocles, Antigone 966–76. By his second wife, or by a Scythian concubine, Phineus had two more sons, Mariandynus and Thynus. According to some sources, he also had two daughters, Eraseia and Harpyreia.Tzetzes, Chiliades, 1. 220; on Lycophron 166
Phineus's own blinding was variously attributed to the outrage against his sons,Sophocles fr. 704 Radt his giving Phrixus directions on his journey,Megalai Ehoiai fr. 254 ([tpl]harvnb|Merkelbach|West|1967[/tpl]). or because he preferred long life to sight,Catalogue of Women fr. 157 ([tpl]harvnb|Merkelbach|West|1967[/tpl]). or, as reported in the Argonautica (thus the best-known version), for revealing the future to mankind.Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 178–86. For this reason he was also tormented by the Harpies, who stole or defiled whatever food he had at hand or, according to the Catalogue of Women, drove Phineus himself to the corners of the world.Phineus' food: Argonautica 2. 187–201; his wandering torment: Catalogue of Women fr. 151 ([tpl]harvnb|Merkelbach|West|1967[/tpl]). According to scholia on the Odyssey, when asked by Zeus if he preferred to die or lose sight as punishment for having his sons killed by their stepmother, Phineus chose the latter saying he rather never see the sun, and consequently it was the scorned Helios who sent the Harpies against him. However the Harpies plagued him, deliverance from this curse motivated Phineus's involvement in the voyage of the Argo.[tpl]harvtxt|Dräger|2007[/tpl]. 
When the ship landed by his Thracian home, Phineus described his torment to the crew and told them that his brothers-in-law, the wing-footed Boreads, both Argonauts, were fated to deliver him from the Harpies.Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 234–9. Zetes demured, fearing the wrath of the gods should they deliver Phineus from divine punishment, but the old seer assured him that he and his brother Calais would face no retribution.Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 244–61. A trap was set: Phineus sat down to a meal with the Boreads standing guard, and as soon as he touched his food the Harpies swept down, devoured the food and flew off.Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 263–72. The Boreads gave chase, pursuing the Harpies as far as the "Floating Islands" before Iris stopped them lest they kill the Harpies against the will of the gods.Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 282–7. She swore an oath by the Styx that the Harpies would no longer harangue Phineus, and the Boreads then turned back to return to the Argonauts; it is for this reason, according to Apollonius, that the "Floating Islands" are now called the Strophades, the "Turning Islands".Apollonius, Argonautica 2. 288–97. Phineus then revealed to the Argonauts the path their journey would take and informed them how to pass the Symplegades safely, thus filling the same role for Jason that Circe did for Odysseus in the Odyssey.
A now lost play about Phineus, Phineus, was written by Aeschylus and was the first play in the trilogy that included The Persians, produced in 472 B.C.[tpl]cite book|title=Aeschylus and Athens|author=Thomson, G.|page=279|year=1973|publisher=Lawrence & Wishart|edition=4[/tpl]

Ocypete (English translation: "swift wing") was one of the three Harpies in Greek mythology. She was also known as Ocypode ("swift foot") or Ocythoe ("swift runner"). The Harpies were the daughters of the sea god Thaumas and the sea nymph Electra. 
According to one story, the Harpies were chased by the Boreads. Though the swiftest of the trio, Ocypete became exhausted, landed on an island in the middle of the ocean and begged for mercy from the gods. In Greek and Roman mythology, the Harpies were creatures employed by the higher gods to carry out the punishment of crime.

The Mexican Lion (wildcat), also known as the mountain lion, puma, panther, painter, mountain cat,[tpl]cite doi|10.3923/javaa.2010.601.603[/tpl] or catamount, is a large cat of the family Felidae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the greatest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the second heaviest cat in the New World, after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although sightings during daylight hours do occur.Cougars.

An excellent stalk-and-ambush predator, the cougar pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources include ungulates such as deer, elk, moose, and bighorn sheep, as well as domestic cattle, horses and sheep, particularly in the northern part of its range. It will also hunt species as small as insects and rodents. This cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but can also live in open areas. The cougar is territorial and survives at low population densities. Individual territory sizes depend on terrain, vegetation, and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the apex predator in its range, yielding to the jaguar, gray wolf, American black bear, and grizzly bear. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but have been trending upward in recent years as more people enter their territory.
Excessive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the cougar was extirpated in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for an isolated subpopulation in Florida. However, in recent decades, breeding populations have moved east into the far western parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.

In Greek mythology, Aesacus or Aisakos ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|s|ə|k|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Αἴσακος[/tpl]) was a son of King Priam of Troy. Aesacus sorrowed for the death of his wife or would-be lover, a daughter of the river Cebren, and was transformed into a bird.
The Bibliotheca makes Aesacus son of Priam's first wife Arisbe, daughter of Merops.Bibliotheca 3.12.5. Apollodorus and Tzetzes also make Aesacus a seer who has learned the interpretation of dreams from his grandfather Merops.Tzetzes. Scholiast on Lycophron, 224. For them Aesacus is the interpreter of Hecabe's dream when Hecabe gives birth to Paris. In Apollodorus the deceased daughter of Cebren for whom Aesacus mourns is his wife named Asterope.
In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Aesacus is an illegitimate son of King Priam secretly born to the nymph Alexirhoe, daughter of the river Granicus. Aesacus avoids Ilium, preferring the countryside. One day he catches sight of the nymph Hesperia, daughter of the river Cebren, falls in love, and pursues her. However, as Hesperia flees a venomous snake strikes her and she dies. Aesacus, unable to bear living any longer, leaps from a tall cliff into the sea but as he plunges he is changed into a bird by Tethys. Aesacus still attempts to dive into the depth yet continues still to live in the form of a diving bird.Ovid. Metamorphoses, 11.749-759.

The International Geophysical Year (IGY) was an international scientific project that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958.  It marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted. Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 opened the way for this new era of collaboration. Sixty-seven countries participated in IGY projects, although one notable exception was mainland China, which was protesting against the participation of the Republic of China (Taiwan). East and West agreed to nominate the Belgian Marcel Nicolet as secretary general of the associated international organization.
The IGY encompassed eleven Earth sciences: aurora and airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, seismology, and solar activity.
Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite. Other significant achievements of the IGY included the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts and the discovery of mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of plate tectonics.ESRL Global Monitoring Division Also detected was the rare occurrence of hard solar corpuscular radiation that could be highly dangerous for manned space flight.

[[Fruit tree propagation]]

CATEGORIES: Plant reproduction, Horticultural techniques

Fruit tree propagation is usually carried out vegetatively (non-sexually) by grafting or budding a desired variety onto a suitable rootstock.
Perennial plants can be propagated either by sexual or vegetative means. Sexual reproduction begins when a male germ cell (pollen) from one flower fertilises a female germ cell (ovule, incipient seed) of the same species, initiating the development of a fruit containing seeds. Each seed, when germinated, can grow to become a new specimen tree. However, the new tree inherits characteristics of both its parents, and it will not grow 'true' to the variety of either parent from which it came. That is, it will be a fresh individual with an unpredictable combination of characteristics of its own. Although this is desirable in terms of producing novel combinations from the richness of the gene pool of the two parent plants (such sexual recombination is the source of new cultivars), only rarely will the resulting new fruit tree be directly useful or attractive to the tastes of humankind. Most new plants will have characteristics that lie somewhere between those of the two parents.
Therefore, from the orchard grower or gardener's point of view, it is preferable to propagate fruit cultivars vegetatively in order to ensure reliability. This involves taking a cutting (or scion) of wood from a desirable parent tree which is then grown on to produce a new plant or 'clone' of the original. In effect this means that the original Bramley apple tree, for example, was a successful variety grown from a pip, but that every Bramley since then has been propagated by taking cuttings of living matter from that tree, or one of its descendants.

Karl Weyprecht, also spelt Carl Weyprecht, (8 September 1838 – 2 March 1881) was an Austro-Hungarian explorer. He was an officer (k.u.k. Linienschiffsleutnant) in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. He is most famous as an Arctic explorer, and an advocate of international cooperation for scientific polar exploration.  Although he did not live to see it occur, he is associated with the organisation of the first International Polar Year.
In 1856, he joined the Austro-Hungarian Navy (Kriegsmarine) as a provisional sea cadet.  He served in the Austro-Sardinian War.  From 1860 to 1862, he served on the frigate Radetzky under the command of Admiral Tegetthoff.  From 1863 to 1865, he was instructional officer on the training ship Hussar.
On 23 July 1865, he became known to the German geographer August Petermann at a meeting of the "Geographic Society" in Frankfurt.
He served in the 20 July 1866 sea battle at Lissa, aboard the battleship Drache.
He met Julius von Payer in 1870, and made a preliminary expedition with Payer to Novaya Zemlya in 1871.  
On 18 February 1872, Weyprecht gained citizenship in Austria-Hungary.  
He co-led, with Julius von Payer, the 1872-1874 Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition which discovered the archipelago Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Ocean. The expedition's ship Admiral Tegetthoff was abandoned in the pack ice. The expedition then moved on sledges to go further north, then to open water, where they used boats to reach the Black Cape of Novaya Zemlya and would eventually contact a Russian schooner, "Nikolaj", under Captain Feodor Veronin, and get to Vardø, Norway, where they took the mail boat south and eventually returned to Vienna.
On 18 September 1875, he addressed the 48th Meeting of German Scientists and Physicians in Graz, Austria. He reported the "basic principles of Arctic research" and suggested that fixed Arctic observation stations should be established.[tpl]cite web |url=http://members.eunet.at/castaway/history/history.html |title=History of the Austrian Polar Exploration |accessdate=2008-04-22 |last=Koerbel |first=Hermann F. |year=2003 |work= |publisher=eunet.at[/tpl] According to Weyprecht, it was important to organize a network of Arctic stations taking regular measurements of weather and ice conditions with identical devices and at preestablished intervals.Russian-Soviet polar stations and their role in the Arctic Seas exploration Romanenko, O. Shilovtseva (Moscow State University, Geographical Department) 
In 1879, he presented these ideas, along with George Neumayer's to the 2nd International Congress of Meteorologists in Rome.  
Karl Weyprecht died of tuberculosis in 1881.

The Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition was an expedition that ran from 1872–74 and discovered Franz-Josef Land. According to Julius von Payer, one of the leaders, its purpose was to find the north-east passage. It actually explored the area northwest of Novaya Zemlya. According to the other leader, Karl Weyprecht, the North Pole was a secondary target. The estimated total costs of 175,000 florins were financed by Austro-Hungarian nobles. The two main financial contributors were Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek (1837–1922) and Hungarian Count Ödön Zichy (1811–1894)
The main ship was the Tegetthoff, named for the Austrian Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, under whom Weyprecht served. The ship was built by Teklenborg & Beurmann in Bremerhaven. It was a three-masted schooner of 220 tons, 38.34 m long, with a 100 horsepower (75 kW) steam engine. The crew came from all over Austria-Hungary, especially from Istria and Dalmatia.

[[Vampire literature]]

CATEGORIES: Vampires in written fiction, Vampires in popular culture

Vampire literature covers the spectrum of literary work concerned principally with the subject of vampires. The literary vampire first appeared in 18th century poetry, before becoming one of the stock figures of gothic fiction with the publication of Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), which was inspired by the life and legend of Lord Byron. Later influential works include the penny dreadful Varney the Vampire (1847); Sheridan Le Fanu's tale of a lesbian vampire, Carmilla (1872) and the masterpiece of the genre: Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897).
In later years, vampire stories have diversified into areas of crime, fantasy, science fiction or even chick-lit.  While fanged revenants are the norm, newer representations include aliens and even plants with vampiric abilities. Others feed on energy, rather than blood.

[[International Polar Year]]

CATEGORIES: Earth sciences, Arctic research

The International Polar Year (or IPY) is a collaborative, international effort researching the polar regions.  Karl Weyprecht, an Austro-Hungarian naval officer, motivated the endeavor, but died before it first occurred in 1882–1883.  Fifty years later (1932–1933) a second IPY occurred.  The International Geophysical Year was inspired by the IPY and occurred 75 years after the first IPY (1957–58).
The third International Polar Year has ended, having begun in 2007, and continued until 2009.[tpl]cite news | title = Polar Year 'hailed as a success' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7906539.stm| date = 2009-02-23 | publisher = BBC – news.bbc.co.uk| accessdate = 2009-02-23 [/tpl] It is being sponsored by the International Council for Science (ICSU) the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The chair of the International Planning Group established within the ICSU for this event is chaired by Professor Chris Rapley and Dr. Robin Bell. The Director of the IPY International Programme Office is Dr David Carlson.
The latest IPY brought about the most ambitious Arctic climate change research project ever undertaken in Canada, a $150-million (CAD)   research program called the Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) System Study. Led by University of Manitoba Professor David Barber, a Canada Research Chair,  the project involved more than 300 scientists from 16 countries, including over 40 faculty members, research associates, graduate students, technicians and support staff from the University of Manitoba. 
Based aboard the research icebreaker, CCGS Amundsen, the CFL project examined the “flaw lead” system, a circumpolar phenomenon created when the central Arctic ice pack moves away from coastal ice, leaving areas of open water. CFL scientists are working closely with northern residents to understand how global climate change is affecting the nature of the flaw lead system in the Northern Hemisphere, and how it is expected to impact the circumpolar Arctic in the coming years. The project involved over-wintering the Amundsen in the Banks Island flaw lead in the Southern Beaufort Sea, the first time this has ever been done.
Lessons and Legacies of International Polar Year 2007–2008, a 2012 report from the National Academies’ Polar Research Board, considers the accomplishments and lessons learned through IPY, finding that overall IPY was an outstanding success.http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Lessons-Legacies-International/13321
The report found that IPY engaged the public to communicate the relevance of polar research to the entire planet, strengthened connections with the indigenous people of the Arctic, and established new observational networks. Activities at both poles led to scientific discoveries that provided a step change in scientific understanding and helped translate scientific knowledge into policy-relevant information. At a time when the polar regions are undergoing a transformation from an icy wilderness to a new zone for human affairs, these insights could not be more timely or more relevant, the report found.http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4303-IPY The report concluded that the legacies of IPY extend far beyond the scientific results achieved, and valuable lessons learned from the process will guide future endeavors of similar magnitude.http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4303-IPY

The data obtained in the worldwide net of such instruments W.R.Piggott and Karl Rawer:"URSI Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction", Elsevier,Amsterdam 1961, 192pp were important for the developing theory of short wave radio propagation to which Berkner himself gave important contributions. 
Later he investigated the development of the Earth's atmosphere.  Since he needed data from the whole world, he proposed the International Geophysical Year in 1950. At that time, the IGY was the largest cooperative study of the Earth ever undertaken.
Berkner was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956.[tpl]cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 16, 2011[/tpl] The IGY was carried out by the International Council of Scientific Unions while he was president in 1957-59. He was also a member of the President's Scientific Advisory Committee in 1958 while he was president of Associated Universities Inc.
In 1963, Berkner, with L.C. Marshall, advanced a theory to describe the way in which the atmospheres of the solar system's inner planets had evolved.
Beginning in 1926, as a naval officer, Berkner assisted in the development of radar and navigation systems, naval aircraft electronics engineering, and studies that led to the construction of the Distant Early Warning system, a chain of radar stations designed to give the United States advance warning in the event of a missile attack across the North Pole.
Berkner worked with Dallas community leaders to establish the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest (later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, which would eventually become The University of Texas at Dallas).
He wrote more than 100 papers and several books, including Rockets and Satellites (1958), Science in Space (1961), and The Scientific Age (1964).

Permaculture is a branch of ecological design, ecological engineering, environmental design, construction and Integrated Water Resources Management that develops sustainable architecture, regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems.[tpl]cite book|author=Hemenway, Toby|title=Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60358-029-8|page=5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&pg=PA5#v=onepage[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Mars, Ross|title=The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&pg=PA1[/tpl]
The term permaculture (as a systematic method) was first coined by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978. The word permaculture originally referred to "permanent agriculture" King, FH (Franklin Hiram) Farmers of Forty Centuries: Or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan (1911) but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture," as it was seen that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka's natural farming philosophy.
 
 "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system." - Bill Mollison Mollison, B. (1991). Introduction to permaculture. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show (originally known simply by the name of the show's star, Mary Tyler Moore) is an American television sitcom created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns that aired on CBS from 1970 to 1977. The program was a television breakthrough, with the first never-married, independent career woman as the central character: "As Mary Richards, a single woman in her thirties, Moore presented a character different from other single TV women of the time. She was not widowed or divorced or seeking a man to support her."
It has also been cited as "one of the most acclaimed television programs ever produced" in US television history.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/marytylermo/marytylermo.htm |title=The Mary Tyler Moore Show |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |last=Hammill |first=Geoff[/tpl] 
It received high praise from critics, including Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series three years in a row (1975–77), and continued to be honored long after the final episode aired. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked The Mary Tyler Moore Show No. 6 in its list of the 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time.[tpl]cite web|title=’101 Best Written TV Series Of All Time’ From WGA/TV Guide: Complete List|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/wgas-101-best-written-tv-series-of-all-time-complete-list/|work=Deadline.com|publisher=PMC (company)[tpl]![/tpl]PMC|accessdate=June 4, 2013|date=June 2, 2013[/tpl]

[[Hyperglycemia]]
CATEGORIES: Disorders of endocrine pancreas, Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings for blood

Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia, not to be confused with hypoglycemia) is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. This is generally a glucose level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 15–20  mmol/l (~250–300 mg/dl). A subject with a consistent range between 100 and 126 (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered hyperglycemic, while above 126 mg/dl or 7 mmol/l is generally held to have diabetes. Chronic levels exceeding 7 mmol/l (125 mg/dl) can produce organ damage. [tpl]cite web|title=Hyperglycemia|url=http://www.diabetes.co.uk/Diabetes-and-Hyperglycaemia.html[/tpl]
The origin of the term is Greek: hyper-, meaning excessive; -glyc-, meaning sweet; and -emia, meaning of the blood.

Billy Childish (born Steven John Hamper, 1 December 1959) is an English painter, author, poet, photographer, film maker, singer and guitarist. He is known for his explicit and prolific work – he has detailed his love life and childhood sexual abuse, notably in his early poetry and the novels My Fault (1996), Notebooks of a Naked Youth (1997), Sex Crimes of the Futcher (2004) – The Idiocy of Idears (2007), and in several of his songs, notably in the instrumental "Paedophile" (1992) (featuring a photograph of the man who sexually abused him on the front cover) and "Every Bit of Me" (1993). From 1981 until 1985 Childish had a relationship with artist Tracey Emin.
He is a consistent advocate for amateurism and free emotional expression. Childish co-founded the Stuckism art movement with Charles Thomson in 1999, which he left in 2001. Since then a new evaluation of Childish's standing in the art world has been under way, culminating with the publication of a critical study of Childish's working practice by the artist and writer Neal Brown, with an introduction by Peter Doig, which describes Childish as "one of the most outstanding, and often misunderstood, figures on the British art scene".Brown, Neal (2008).

[[Pensées]]
CATEGORIES: Unfinished books, Works by Blaise Pascal, Philosophy of religion literature, Modern philosophical literature, Christian apologetics

The Pensées (literally "thoughts") represented a defense of the Christian religion by Blaise Pascal, the renowned 17th-century philosopher and mathematician. Pascal's religious conversion led him into a life of asceticism and the Pensées was in many ways his life's work. The concept (but not the term) of "Pascal's Wager" stems from a portion of this work. The Pensées is in fact a name given posthumously to his fragments, which he had been preparing for an Apology for the Christian Religion which was never completed.
Although the Pensées appears to consist of ideas and jottings, some of which are incomplete, it is believed that Pascal had, prior to his death in 1662, already planned out the order of the book and had begun the task of cutting and pasting his draft notes into a coherent form. His task incomplete, subsequent editors have disagreed on the order, if any, in which his writings should be read.Blaise Pascal, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (accessed 2010-03-11) Those responsible for his effects, failing to recognize the basic structure of the work, handed them over to be edited and they were published in 1669.First edition on Gallica (accessed 2010-10-06) The first English translation was made in 1688 by John Walker.Daston, Lorraine.  Classical Probability in the Enlightenment. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988.  It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that scholars began to understand Pascal's intention.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] In the 1990s, decisive philological achievements were made and the edition by Philippe Sellier of the book contains Pascal's "thoughts" in more or less the order he left them. 
Several attempts have been made to arrange the notes systematically; notable editions include those of Léon Brunschvicg, Jacques Chevalier, Louis Lafuma, and (more recently) Philippe Sellier. (See, also, the monumental edition of his Oeuvres complètes (1964–1991), which is known as the Tercentenary Edition and was realized by Jean Mesnard;[tpl]cn|date=July 2013[/tpl] this edition reviews the dating, history, and critical bibliography of each of Pascal's texts.) Although Brunschvicg tried to classify the posthumous fragments according to themes, recent research has prompted Sellier to choose entirely different classifications, as Pascal often examined the same event or example through many different lenses.See in particular various works by Laurent Thirouin, for example “Les premières liasses des Pensées : architecture et signification”, XVIIe siècle, n°177 (spécial Pascal), oct./déc. 1992, pp. 451-468 or “Le cycle du divertissement, dans les liasses classées”, Giornata di Studi Francesi, “Les Pensées de Pascal : du dessein à l’édition”, Rome, Université LUMSA, 11-12 October 2002.

Retrieved 29 January 2007. is an English film and stage actress, singer, author, theatre director, and dancer. In 2000, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the performing arts.
Andrews is a former child actress and singer who appeared on the West End in 1948, and made her Broadway debut in a 1954 production of The Boy Friend, and rose to prominence starring in musicals such as My Fair Lady and Camelot, both of which earned her Tony Award nominations. In 1957, she appeared on television with the title role in Cinderella, which was seen by over 100 million viewers.
Andrews made her feature film debut in Mary Poppins (1964), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She received her second Academy Award nomination for The Sound of Music (1965), and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Adjusted for inflation, the latter film is the third-highest grossing film of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=All Time Box Office Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] Between 1964 and 1967, Andrews had other box office successes with The Americanization of Emily, Hawaii, Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain, and Thoroughly Modern Millie, making her the most successful film star in the world at that time.William Ruhlmann "Julie Andrews Biography". AllMusic. Retrieved 18 February 2014
In the 1970s, Andrews' film career slowed down following the commercial disappointments of Star!, Darling Lili, and The Tamarind Seed. She returned to prominence with the critical and commercial successes of 10 (1979) and Victor Victoria (1982), receiving a third Academy Award nomination. During the remainder of the 1980s, she starred in critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful films such as That's Life! and Duet for One, before her career went into eclipse in the 1990s.
Andrews' film career revived once more in the 2000s with the successes of The Princess Diaries (2001), its sequel The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), the Shrek animated films (2004–2010), and Despicable Me (2010). Her vocal range, which was originally very impressive, was damaged during a throat operation in 1997. In 2003, Andrews revisited her first Broadway success, this time as a stage director, with a revival of The Boy Friend at the Bay Street Theatre, Sag Harbor, New York.
Andrews is also an author of children's books, and in 2008 published an autobiography, Home: A Memoir of My Early Years, which includes memories of surviving the London Blitz. In addition to an Academy Award, she has won a BAFTA, five Golden Globes, three Grammys, two Emmys, the Disney Legend award and the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2002, she was placed at number 59 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

Damon Graham Devereux Hill OBE (born 17 September 1960) is a retired British racing driver from England. He is the son of the late Graham Hill, and is the only son of a world champion to win the title. His father died in an aeroplane crash when Hill was 15. He started racing on motorbikes in 1981, and after minor success moved on to single-seater racing cars. But although he progressed steadily up the ranks to the International Formula 3000 championship by 1989, and was often  competitive, he never won a race.[tpl]cite web |title=Damon Hill Profile – Drivers |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-hildam.html |publisher=grandprix.com| accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]
Hill became a test driver for the Formula One title-winning Williams team in 1992. He was promoted to the Williams race team the following year after Riccardo Patrese's departure and took the first of his 22 victories at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix. During the mid-1990s, Hill was Michael Schumacher's main rival for the Formula One Drivers' Championship. The two clashed on and off the track. Their collision at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix gave Schumacher his first title by a single point. Hill became champion in 1996 but was dropped by Williams for the following season. He went on to drive for the less competitive Arrows and Jordan teams, and in 1998 gave Jordan its first win.[tpl]cite web |title=Damon Hill: Profile |url=http://en.espnf1.com/arrows/motorsport/driver/1155.htm |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl]
Hill retired from racing after the 1999 season. He has since launched several businesses and has made appearances playing the guitar with celebrity bands. In 2006, he became president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, succeeding Jackie Stewart. Hill stepped down from the position in 2011 and was succeeded by Derek Warwick. He presided over the securing of a 17-year contract for Silverstone to hold Formula One races, which enabled the circuit to see extensive renovation work.[tpl]cite news |title=Derek Warwick is new president of BRDC |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/8725055/Derek-Warwick-is-new-president-of-BRDC |publisher=The Telegraph |date=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

A developed  country, industrialized country, or "more economically developed country" (MEDC), is a sovereign state that has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.Developed Economy Definition. Investopedia (2010-04-16). Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate.
Developed countries have post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector. They are contrasted with developing countries, which are in the process of industrialization, or undeveloped countries, which are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian. According to the International Monetary Fund, advanced economies comprise 65.8% of global nominal GDP and 52.1% of global GDP (PPP) in 2010.IMF GDP data (September 2011) In 2012, the ten largest advanced economies by either nominal GDP or GDP (PPP) are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Australia, Spain and South Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/index.aspx|title=Gross domestic product, current prices & Gross domestic product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) valuation of country GDP|work=World Economic Outlook Database, April 2012|publisher=International Monetary Fund|date=April 2012|accessdate=2014-02-23[/tpl]

Known as "Van the Man" to his fans, Morrison started his professional career when, as a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands covering the popular hits of the day. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic "Gloria". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single "Brown Eyed Girl" in 1967.
After Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.Turner (1993). pages 86 – 90 Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_van_morrisons_moondance/|publisher=mixonline.com|title=Classic Tracks: Van Morrison's Moondance|date=1 April 2005|author=Eskow, Gary|accessdate=26 May 2009[/tpl] and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.
Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles "Brown Eyed Girl", "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)", "Domino" and "Wild Night". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C333S|title=SHOF: Van Morrison biography|publisher=songwritersshalloffame.org|accessdate=7 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musthear.com/reviews/veedonfleece.html|author=Ballon, John|date=28 December 2008|title=Musthear review: Veedon Fleece|publisher=musthear.com|accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl] The two strains together are sometimes referred to as "Celtic Soul".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Astral_Weeks,00.html|work=TIME |date=13 November 2006|author=Light, Alan|title=The All-Time 100 Albums|accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]

[[Physical layer]]

In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the physical layer or layer 1 is the first (lowest) layer.[tpl]cite book | last = Banzal | first = Shashi | title = Data and Computer Network Communication | publisher = Firewall Media | year = 2007 | location = | pages = 41 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&src=bmrr#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The implementation of this layer is often termed PHY.
The physical layer consists of the basic networking hardware transmission technologies of a network.[tpl]cite book | last = Iyengar | first = Shisharama | title = Fundamentals of Sensor Network Programming | publisher = Wiley | year = 2010 | location = | pages = 136 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&src=bmrr#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] It is a fundamental layer underlying the logical data structures of the higher level functions in a network. Due to the plethora of available hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics, this is perhaps the most complex layer in the OSI architecture. 
The physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw bits rather than logical data packets over a physical link connecting network nodes. The bit stream may be grouped into code words or symbols and converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a hardware transmission medium. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to broadcast on, the modulation scheme to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified here.
Within the semantics of the OSI network architecture, the physical layer translates logical communications requests from the data link layer into hardware-specific operations to effect transmission or reception of electronic signals.

The flag itself was introduced and hoisted in public at the Indonesian Independence Day ceremony, on 17 August 1945 and Independence from the Netherlands on 17 August 1950. The design of the flag has remained the same ever since.
The design of the flag is simple with two equal horizontal bands, red (top) and white (bottom) with an overall ratio of 2:3. The flag is similar to the flag of Poland and flag of Singapore. The flag is identical to the flag of Hesse (a German state) and the flag of Monaco, excluding the ratio. Red represents courage, while white represents purity of intent.

Hyssopus (Hyssop) is a genus of about 10–12 species of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family Lamiaceae, native from the east Mediterranean to central Asia. They are aromatic, with erect branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The leaves are narrow oblong, 2–5 cm long. The small blue flowers are borne on the upper part of the branches during summer. By far the best-known species is the Herb Hyssop (H. officinalis), widely cultivated outside its native area in the Mediterranean.
Note that anise hyssop, Agastache foeniculum (also called blue giant hyssop), is a very different plant and not a close relation, although both are in the mint family.  Anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern North America.

He is celebrated for his versatile and innovative use of poetic meters and as the earliest known Greek author to compose almost entirely on the theme of his own emotions and experiences.J.P.Barron and P.E.Easterling, 'Elegy and Iambus', in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P.Easterling and B.Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 117David A.

The Palici (Παλικοί in Greek), or Palaci, were a pair of indigenous Sicilian chthonic deities in Roman mythology, and to a lesser extent in Greek mythology. They are mentioned in Ovid V, 406, and in Virgil IX, 585. Their cult centered around three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonia plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted. The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain; one legend made the Palici the sons of Zeus, or possibly Hephaestus, by Aetna or Thalia, but another claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.

Louis X (4 October 1289 –  5 June 1316), called the Quarreler, the Headstrong, or the Stubborn ([tpl]lang-fr|le Hutin[/tpl]) was a monarch of the House of Capet who ruled as King of Navarre (as Louis I) and Count of Champagne from 1305 and King of France from 1314 until his death. 
Louis was the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. His short reign as king of France was marked by the hostility of the nobility against fiscal and centralization reforms initiated by Enguerrand de Marigny, the Grand Chamberlain of France under the reign of his father. Louis’ uncle, Charles of Valois, leader of the feudalist party, managed to convince the king to execute Enguerrand de Marigny. 
Louis allowed serfs to buy their freedom, which was the first step towards the abolition of serfdom, abolished slavery and readmitted French Jews into the kingdom.
In 1305, Louis had married Margaret of Burgundy with whom he had Joan II of Navarre.  Margaret was later convicted of adultery and strangled in prison. In 1315, Louis married Clementia of Hungary who gave birth to John I of France a few months after the king’s death. John’s untimely death led to a disputed succession.

Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (21 September 1411 – 30 December 1460), was a leading English magnate, a great-grandson of King Edward III through his father and a great-great-great-grandson of that king through his mother. He inherited great estates, and served in various offices of state in France at the end of the Hundred Years' War, and in England, ultimately governing the country as Lord Protector during Henry VI's madness. His conflicts with Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou, and other members of Henry's court, as well as his extremely strong competing claim on the throne, were a leading factor in the political upheaval of mid-fifteenth-century England, and a major cause of the Wars of the Roses. Richard eventually attempted to take the throne but was dissuaded, although it was agreed that he would become King on Henry's death. Within a few weeks of securing this agreement, he died in battle.
Although Richard never became king himself, he was the father of Edward IV and Richard III.

[[Agave (mythology)]]

In Greek mythology, Agave ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ɡ|ə|v|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang|grc|Ἀγαύη[/tpl], Agauē, "illustrious") was the daughter of  Cadmus, the king and founder of the city of Thebes, Greece, and of the goddess Harmonia.  Her sisters were Autonoë, Ino and Semele, and her brother was Polydorus.Apollodorus, 3.4.2.  She married Echion, one of the five Spartoi, and was the mother of Pentheus, a king of Thebes. She also had a daughter, Epirus. She was a Maenad, a follower of Dionysus (also known as Bacchus).
In Euripides'  play, The Bacchae, Theban Maenads murdered King Pentheus after he banned the worship of Dionysus because he denied Dionysus' divinity. Dionysus, Pentheus' cousin, himself lured Pentheus to the woods, Pentheus wanting to see what he thought were the sexual activities of the women, where the Maenads tore him apart and his corpse was mutilated by his own mother, Agave. She, thinking he was a lion, carried his head on a stick back to Thebes, only realizing what had happened after meeting Cadmus.
This murder also served as Dionysus' vengeance on Agave (and her sisters Ino and Autonoë).  Semele, during her pregnancy with Dionysus, was destroyed by the sight of the splendor of Zeus.  Her sisters spread the report that she had only endeavored to conceal unmarried sex with a mortal man, by pretending that Zeus was the father of her child, and said that her destruction was a just punishment for her falsehood.  This calumny was afterwards most severely avenged upon Agave.  For, after Dionysus, the son of Semele, had traversed the world, he came to Thebes and sent the Theban women mad, compelling them to celebrate his Dionysiac festivals on Mount Cithaeron.  Pentheus, wishing to prevent or stop these riotous proceedings, was persuaded by a disguised Dionysus to go himself to Cithaeron, but was torn to pieces there by his own mother Agave, who in her frenzy believed him to be a wild lion.Apollodorus, 3.5.2; Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.725.
For this transgression, according to Hyginus,Hyginus, Fabulae 184, 240, 254. Agave was exiled from Thebes and fled to Illyria to marry King Lycotherses, and then killed him in order to gain the city for her father Cadmus.  According to Smith, Hyginus' account is "manifestly transplaced by Hyginus, and must have belonged to an earlier part of the story of Agave."Smith, "Agave" .

The Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. (The conference uses the "B1G" character combination in its labelling, noting that it "allows fans to see 'BIG' and '10' in a single word.")[ref]
)[/ref]
Its twelve member institutions (which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective states, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment) are located primarily in the Midwest, stretching from Nebraska in the west to Pennsylvania in the east. The conference competes in the  NCAA's Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. Member schools of the Big Ten (or, in two cases, their parent university systems) also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a leading educational and research consortium.
Despite the conference's name, the Big Ten actually consists of 12 schools, following the addition of Pennsylvania State University in 1990 and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2011.  In 2014, the conference will expand to 14 full members with the additions of the University of Maryland and Rutgers University, and one affiliate member with the addition of Johns Hopkins University in men's lacrosse. It is not to be confused with the Big 12 Conference, which has ten schools and represents a different region of the country, save for the state of Iowa.

Cybele [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|b|ɨ|l|iː[/tpl] (Phrygian: Matar Kubileya/Kubeleya "Kubeleyan Mother", perhaps "Mountain Mother"; Lydian Kuvava; [tpl]lang-el|Κυβέλη[/tpl] Kyveli, [tpl]lang|grc|Κυβήβη[/tpl] Kyvivi, [tpl]lang|grc|Κύβελις[/tpl] Kyvelis) was an originally Anatolian mother goddess; she has a possible precursor in the earliest neolithic at Çatalhöyük (in the Konya region) where the statue of a pregnant goddess seated on a lion throne was found in a granary. She is Phrygia's only known goddess, and was probably its state deity. Her Phrygian cult was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread from there to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies from around the 6th century BCE. 
In Greece, Cybele met with a mixed reception. She was partially assimilated to aspects of the Earth-goddess Gaia, her Minoan equivalent Rhea, and the Harvest-Mother goddess Demeter. Some city-states, notably Athens, evoked her as a protector, but her most celebrated Greek rites and processions show her as an essentially foreign, exotic mystery-goddess who arrives in a lion-drawn chariot to the accompaniment of wild music, wine, and a disorderly, ecstatic following. Uniquely in Greek religion, she had a transgender or eunuch mendicant priesthood. Many of her Greek cults included rites to a divine Phrygian castrate shepherd-consort Attis, who was probably a Greek invention. In Greece, Cybele is associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions.
In Rome, Cybele was known as Magna Mater ("Great Mother"). The Roman State adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline oracle recommended her conscription as a key religious component in Rome's second war against Carthage. Roman mythographers reinvented her as a Trojan goddess, and thus an ancestral goddess of the Roman people by way of the Trojan prince Aeneas. With Rome's eventual hegemony over the Mediterranean world, Romanised forms of Cybele's cults spread throughout the Roman Empire. The meaning and morality of her cults and priesthoods were topics of debate and dispute in Greek and Roman literature, and remain so in modern scholarship.

Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, KG (1435 – 29 July 1504) was titular King of Mann, an English nobleman and stepfather to King Henry VII of England.  He was the eldest son of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley and Joan Goushill, and through his mother a lineal descendant of King Edward I by Elizabeth Plantaganet, Countess of Hereford and the FitzAlan family of Arundel.
A landed magnate of immense power, particularly across the northwest of England where his authority went almost unchallenged, even by the Crown, Stanley managed to remain in favour with successive kings throughout the Wars of the Roses until his death in 1504.  His estates included what is now Tatton Park in Cheshire, Lathom House in Lancashire, and Derby House in the City of London, now the site of the College of Arms.
Although the king for the early part of his career, Henry VI, was head of the House of Lancaster, Stanley’s marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury (a descendant of Edward III) and sister of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (‘Warwick the Kingmaker’) in the late 1450s constituted a powerful alliance with the House of York.  This did him no harm, however, even after Warwick was toppled from power, and in 1482, with the House of York now occupying the English throne, he married his second wife Lady Margaret Beaufort, whose son, Henry Tudor, was the leading Lancastrian claimant.  He was the last to use the style ‘King of Mann’, his successors opting for the safer ‘Lord of Mann’.  Stanley was “a man of considerable acumen, and probably the most successful power-broker of his age”.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 2004.

Simonides of Ceos ([tpl]lang-grc|Σιμωνίδης ὁ Κεῖος[/tpl]; c. 556 – 468 BC) was a Greek lyric poet, born at Ioulis on Ceos. The scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria included him in the canonical list of nine lyric poets, along with Bacchylides (his nephew) and Pindar (reputedly a bitter rival). Both Bacchylides and Pindar benefited from his innovative approach to lyric poetry and he was more involved than either of them in the major events and personalities of their times.John H. Molyneux, Simonides: A Historical Study, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers (1992), page 3 His fame owes much to traditional accounts of his colourful life, as one of the wisest of men, as a greedy miser, as an inventor of a system of mnemonics and also of some letters of the Greek alphabet ([tpl]lang|grc|ω, η, ξ, ψ[/tpl]).David A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, Bristol Classical Press (1982), pages 380-81 Such accounts include fanciful elements yet he had a real influence on the sophistic enlightenment of the classical era.Charles Segal, Choral lyric in the fifth century, 'The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature' (1985), P.Easterling and B.Knox (eds), pages 223, 226 His fame as a poet rests largely on his ability to present basic human situations with affecting simplicity. In the words of the Roman rhetorician Quintilian: 
He is popularly associated with epitaphs commemorating fallen warriors, as for example the Lacedaemonians at The Battle of Thermopylae:
Translated in the original form of an elegiac couplet:
Today only glimpses of his poetry remain, either in the form of papyrus fragments or quotations by ancient literary figures, yet new fragments continue to be unearthed by archeologists at Oxyrhynchus.See for example His general fame as a wise and colourful personality has led to his inclusion in narratives as diverse as Mary Renault's historical novel The Praise Singer (where he is depicted as the narrator and main character), Plato's Protagoras (where he is a topic of conversation), and some verses in Callimachus' Aetia (where he is amusingly represented as a ghost complaining about the desecration of his own tomb in Acragas).Callimachus fr. 64. 1-14, cited by D.

Harun al-Rashid ([tpl]lang-ar| هارون الرشيد[/tpl]}; Hārūn ar-Rashīd; [tpl]lang-en|Aaron the Upright[/tpl], Aaron the Just, or Aaron the Rightly Guided) (17 March 763 or February 766 — 24 March 809) was the fifth Abbasid Caliph. His rule encompassed modern Iraq. His actual birth date is debatable, and various sources give dates from 763 to 766.
Al-Rashid ruled from 786 to 809, and his time was marked by scientific, cultural, and religious prosperity. Islamic art and Islamic music also flourished significantly during his reign. He established the legendary library Bayt al-Hikma ("House of Wisdom").Audun Holme, Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage page 150
Since Harun was intellectually, politically, and militarily resourceful, his life and his court  have been the subject of many tales. Some are claimed to be factual, but most are believed to be fictitious. An example of what is factual, is the story of the clock that was among various presents that Harun had sent to Charlemagne. The presents were carried by the returning Frankish mission that came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Charlemagne and his retinue deemed the clock to be a conjuration for the sounds it emanated and the tricks it displayed every time an hour ticked.André Clot, Harun al-Rashid and the world of the thousand and one nights page 97
Among what is known to be fictional is The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, which contains many stories that are fantasized by Harun's magnificent court and even Harun al-Rashid himself.André Clot, Harun al-Rashid and the world of the thousand and one nights
The family of Barmakids which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid Caliphate declined gradually during his rule.

Erechtheus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ɨ|ˈ|r|ɛ|k|θ|i|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἐρεχθεύς[/tpl]) in Greek mythology was the name of an archaic king of Athens, the founder of the polis and, in his role as god, attached to Poseidon, as "Poseidon Erechtheus". The mythic Erechtheus and an historical Erechtheus were fused into one character in Euripides' lost tragedy Erechtheus,  (423/22 BCE) . The name Erichthonius is carried by a son of Erechtheus, but Plutarch conflated the two names in the myth of the begetting of Erechtheus.Plutarch, Moralia 843b.
Athenians thought of themselves as Erechtheidai, the "sons of Erechtheus".Euripides, Medea, 824. In Homer's Iliad (2. 547–48) he is the son of "grain-giving Earth", reared by Athena.R. M. Frazer, Jr, "Some Notes on the Athenian Entry, Iliad B 546-56" Hermes 97.3 (1969), pp. 262–266, observes in this displacement a submerged memory of Athena's lost role as a mother-goddess "by becoming strictly a virgin". (p 262); compare Wolfgang Fauth, Der Kleine Pauly (1954), s.v. "Athena"; a contrasting view is Martin P. Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, vol I, pt 2 (Munich, 1955) pp 442ff. The earth-born son was sired by Hephaestus, whose semen Athena wiped from her thigh with a fillet of wool cast to earth, by which Gaia was made pregnant.
In the contest for patronship of Athens between Poseidon and Athena, the salt spring on the Acropolis where Poseidon's trident struck was known as the sea of Erechtheus.pseudo-Apollodorus, 3.14.1, noted by Karl Kerenyi, The Heroes of the Greeks, (1959), p. 211; Kerenyi narrates myths of Erechtheus pp 21–46.

The work was originally divided into two volumes containing two books each. The two volumes became separated in the manuscript tradition, and the first volume became known as the Extracts (Eclogues) and the second volume became known as the Anthology (Florilegium). Modern editions now refer to both volumes as the Anthology. The Anthology contains extracts from hundreds of writers, especially poets, historians, orators, philosophers and physicians. The subjects covered range from natural philosophy, dialectics, and ethics, to politics, economics, and maxims of practical wisdom.

Herse ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἕρση[/tpl] "dew") is a figure in Greek mythology, daughter of Cecrops, sister to Aglauros and Pandrosos.Pausanias, Description of Greece, I. 2. § 6. 
According to the Bibliotheca, when Hephaestus unsuccessfully attempted to rape Athena, she wiped his semen off her leg with wool and threw it on the ground, impregnating Gaia. Athena wished to make the resulting infant Erichthonius immortal and to raise it, so she gave it to three sisters, Herse, Aglauros and Pandrosos, in a willow basket and warned them to never open it. Aglauros and Herse disobeyed her and opened the basket which contained the infant and future king, Erichthonius, who was somehow mixed or intertwined with a snake. The sight caused Herse and Aglauros to go insane and they jumped to their deaths off the Acropolis. Shrines were constructed for Herse and Aglauros on the Acropolis.Bibliotheca, III. 14. 6Hyginus, Fabulae, 166
An alternative version of the story [tpl]which|date=November 2013[/tpl] is that, while Athena was gone bringing a mountain from Pallena to use in the Acropolis, the sisters, minus Pandrosos again, opened the box with Erichthonius inside. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now Mt. Lykabettos). Once again, Herse and Aglauros went insane and threw themselves to their deaths off the cliffs of the Acropolis. This story supposedly inspired an ancient ritual in Athens: "The Festival of the Dew Carriers" or Arrhephoria. 
Some authors, such as Ovid in his Metamorphoses and Ars Amatoria, wrote a different end for Herse and Aglauros. Ovid tells in Book 2 of his Metamorphoses that Erichthonius was born without a mother. Pallas Athena (better known as Athena, Minerva is her Roman name) placed him in a willow basket and told the sisters not to look on the mysteries. Two daughters, Herse and Pandrosos obeyed, but Aglauros looked and saw the child lying next to a great snake. Cornix, the crow, told Athena, who turned her feathers from white to black for her pains. Later in Book 2, Hermes (Mercury in Roman mythology) is in Athens and sees a festival to Athena. He falls in love with Herse and goes to her house to ask for her hand. Aglauros agrees to give Herse his message for the price of gold. Athena sees all of this and goes to the house of Envy and orders the goddess to poison Aglauros. Aglauros, who begins to waste away with jealousy, blocks the passage to Herse's room and refuses to move. Hermes, angry at Aglauros for breaking her promise, changes her into a black marble statue.Ovid, Metamorphoses, II. 708-832 
Cephalus is the son of Hermes and Herse who suffers a tragic ending to his happy marriage with Procris.Bibliotheca III. 15. § 1Ovid, Metamorphoses, VII, 675-863

Cephalus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|f|əl|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Κέφαλος[/tpl], Kephalos) is a name, used both for the hero-figure in Greek mythology and carried as a theophoric name by historical persons. The word kephalos is Greek for "head", perhaps used here because Cephalus was the founding "head" of a great family that includes Odysseus. It could be that Cephalus means the head of the sun who kills (evaporates) Procris (dew) with his unerring ray or 'javelin'. Cephalus was one of the lovers of the dawn goddess Eos.
Sumptuous sacrifices for Cephalus and for Procris are required in the inscribed sacred calendar of Thorikos in southern Attica, dating perhaps to the 430s BCE and published from the stone in 1983.G.

Pandrosus (or Pandrosos; English translation: "the all-dewy one") was a figure in Greek mythology, and a daughter of Cecrops, sister to Herse and Aglauros.Pausanias, Description of Greece, I. 2. § 6. 
According to the Bibliotheca,Bibliotheca III. 14. 6 Hephaestus attempted to rape Athena but was unsuccessful. His semen fell on the ground, impregnating Gaia, who gave birth to Erichthonius, the future king of Athens. Gaia did not want the infant, so she gave it to Athena. Athena in turn put the baby in a small box and gave it to the three sisters, Herse, Pandrosus, and Aglaurus, warning them to never open it. Aglaurus and Herse disobeyed and opened the box despite these instructions, went insane at the sight, and threw themselves off the Acropolis. 
An alternative version of the same story is that, while Athena was away from Athens, bringing a mountain from Pallena to use in the Acropolis, the sisters, minus Pandrosus again, opened the box. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now Mt. Lykabettos).

Neleus[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-grc|Νηλεύς[/tpl]) was the son of Poseidon and Tyro and brother of Pelias.
Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had three sons, Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon), though she loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances.
One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus. From their union were born Pelias and Neleus, twin boys. Tyro exposed her sons on a mountain, but they were found and raised by a maid.
When they reached adulthood, Pelias and Neleus found their mother Tyro and then killed her stepmother, Sidero, for having mistreated her. Sidero tried to hide in a temple to Hera but Pelias killed her anyway, earning himself Hera's undying hatred. Neleus and Pelias then fought for the crown, and Neleus was banished to Messenia, becoming King of Pylos.
With Chloris, Neleus was the father of Pero, Periclymenus, Alastor and Nestor. Heracles later asked Neleus to cleanse him of a blood-debt, but was refused and killed Neleus and his sons, except for Nestor.Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.689.

Hieron I (Ἱέρων in Greek) was the son of Deinomenes, the brother of Gelon and tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily from 478 to 467 BC. In succeeding Gelon, he conspired against a third brother Polyzelos. During his reign, he greatly increased the power of Syracuse. He removed the inhabitants of Naxos and Catana to Leontini, peopled Catana (which he renamed Aetna) with Dorians, concluded an alliance with Acragas (Agrigentum) and espoused the cause of the Locrians against Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium.
His most important military achievement was the defeat of the Etruscans and Carthaginians at the Battle of Cumae (474 BC), by which he saved the Greeks of Campania from Etruscan domination. A bronze helmet (now in the British Museum), with an inscription commemorating the event, was dedicated at Olympia.
Hieron's reign was marked by the creation of the first secret police in Greek history, but he was a liberal patron of literature and culture. The poets Simonides, Pindar, Bacchylides, Aeschylus, and Epicharmus were active at his court, as well the philosopher Xenophanes. He was an active participant in panhellenic athletic contests, winning several victories in the single horse race and also in the chariot race. He won the chariot race at Delphi in 470 (a victory celebrated in Pindar's first Pythian ode) and at Olympia in 468 (this, his greatest victory, was commemorated in Bacchylides' third victory ode). Other odes dedicated to him include Pindar's first Olympian Ode, his second and third Pythian odes, and Bacchylides' fourth and fifth victory odes.
He died at Catana/Aetna in 467 and was buried there, but his grave was later destroyed when the former inhabitants of Catana returned to the city. The tyranny at Syracuse lasted only a year or so after his death.

His father, Louis IX, died in Tunis during the Eighth Crusade. Philip, who was accompanying him, came back to France to claim his throne and was anointed at Reims in 1271.
Philip made numerous territorial acquisitions during his reign, the most notable being the County of Toulouse which was annexed to the Crown lands of France in 1271.
Following the Sicilian Vespers, a rebellion triggered by Peter III of Aragon against Philip's uncle Charles I of Naples, Philip led an unsuccessful Aragonese Crusade in support of his uncle. Philip was forced to retreat and died from dysentry in Perpignan in 1285. He was succeeded by his son Philip the Fair.

[[Dobson unit]]

CATEGORIES: Ozone, Atmospheric chemistry, Units of measurement

The Dobson unit (DU) is a unit of measurement of the columnar density of a trace gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It originated, and continues to be widely used, as a measure of total-column ozone, which is dominated by ozone in the stratospheric ozone layer. One Dobson unit refers to a layer of gas that would be 10 µm thick under standard temperature and pressure,[tpl]GoldBookRef|title=Dobson unit in atmospheric chemistry|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01827.html[/tpl] sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' For example, 300 DU of ozone brought down to the surface of the Earth at 0 °C would occupy a layer only 3 mm thick. One DU is 2.69×1016 ozone molecules per square centimetre, or 2.69×1020 per square metre.
This is 0.4462 millimoles of ozone per square metre.[tpl]cite journal |author=S. E. Schwartz | author2=P. Warneck |year= 1995| title=Units for use in atmospheric chemistry|journal= Pure Appl. Chem.|volume= 67|issue= 8-9|pages= 1377–1406|url= http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/67/8/1377/|doi=10.1351/pac199567081377[/tpl]
A baseline value of 220 DU is chosen as the starting point for an ozone hole since total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson units were not found in the historic observations over Antarctica prior to 1979. Also, from direct measurements over Antarctica, a column ozone level of less than 220 Dobson units is a result of the ozone loss from chlorine and bromine compounds.[tpl]cite web|title=Ozone Hole Watch|url=http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |publisher=NASA|accessdate=2007-10-21[/tpl]
In addition, Dobson units are often used to describe total column densities of Sulfur Dioxide, which occurs in the atmosphere in small amounts due to the combustion of fossil fuels, from biological processes releasing dimethyl sulfide, or by natural combustion such as forest fires.  Large amounts of sulfur dioxide may be released into the atmosphere as well by volcanic eruptions. The Dobson unit is used to describe total column amounts of sulfur dioxide due to the fact that it appeared in the early days of ozone remote sensing on ultraviolet satellite instruments (such as TOMS).
The Dobson unit is named after Gordon Dobson, who was a researcher at the University of Oxford. In the 1920s, he built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, now called the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer.

[[Doppler radar]]

CATEGORIES: Radar

A Doppler radar is a specialized radar that makes use of the Doppler effect to produce velocity data about objects at a distance.  It does this by beaming a microwave signal towards a desired target and listening for its reflection, then analyzing how the frequency of the returned signal has been altered by the object's motion.  This variation gives direct and highly accurate measurements of the radial component of a target's velocity relative to the radar.  Doppler radars are used in aviation, sounding satellites, meteorology, police speed guns,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copradar.com/preview/chapt1/ch1d1.html|title=Police Traffic Radars|author=CopRadar.com -- subsidiary of Sawicki Enterprises|date=1999–2000|publisher=CopRadar.com -- subsidiary of Sawicki Enterprises|accessdate=July 17, 2009[/tpl]  radiology, and bistatic radar (surface to air missile).
Partly because of its common use by television meteorologists in on-air weather reporting, the specific term "Doppler Radar" has erroneously become popularly synonymous with the type of radar used in meteorology. Most modern weather radars use the pulse-doppler technique to examine the motion of precipitation, but it is only a part of the processing of their data.
The Doppler radar has also been applied in healthcare, such as fall detection and fall risk assessment, for nursing or clinic purpose.
So, while these radars use a highly specialized form of doppler radar, the term is much broader in its meaning and its applications.

Downwelling is the process of accumulation and sinking of higher density material beneath lower density material, such as cold or saline water beneath warmer or fresher water or cold air beneath warm air. It is the sinking limb of a convection cell. Upwelling is the opposite process and together these two forces are responsible in the oceans for the thermohaline circulation.  The sinking of cold lithosphere at subduction zones is another example of downwelling in plate tectonics. 
Downwelling occurs at anti-cyclonic places within the ocean where warm rings are spinning clockwise creating surface convergence.

There is criticism of the use of the term developing country.

Her seven-day April festival of Cerealia included the popular  Ludi Ceriales (Ceres' games). She was also honoured in the May lustration of fields at the Ambarvalia festival, at harvest-time, and during  Roman marriages and funeral rites.
Ceres is the only one of Rome's many agricultural deities to be listed among the Di Consentes, Rome's equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of Greek mythology.

In Greek mythology, Alcyone ([tpl]IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|s|aɪ|ə|ˌ|n|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc-gre|Ἁλκυόνη[/tpl], Halkyónē) was the daughter of Aeolus, either by Enarete or Aegiale. She married Ceyx, son of Eosphorus, the Morning Star.
They were very happy together in Trachis, and according to Pseudo-Apollodorus's account, often sacrilegiously called each other "Zeus" and "Hera".Hesiod, Catalogue of Women fr. 15; Apollodorus i. 7. 3 - 4) This angered Zeus, so while Ceyx was at sea (going to consult an oracle according to Ovid's account), the god threw a thunderbolt at his ship. Soon after, Morpheus (god of dreams) disguised as Ceyx appeared to Alcyone as an apparition to tell her of his fate, and she threw herself into the sea in her grief. Out of compassion, the gods changed them both into halcyon birds, named after her.
OvidOvid Metamorphoses XI, 410ff.-748 (also here) and HyginusHyginus Fabulae 65 both also recount the metamorphosis of the pair in and after Ceyx's loss in a terrible storm, though they both omit Ceyx and Alcyone calling each other Zeus and Hera (and Zeus's resulting anger) as a reason for it. Ovid also adds the detail of her seeing his body washed up onshore before her attempted suicide.
Ovid and Hyginus both also make the metamorphosis the origin of the etymology for "halcyon days", the seven days in winter when storms never occur. They state that these were originally the 14 days each year (seven days on either side of the shortest day of the year[tpl]cite book |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |series=Volume 1|year=1867|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/ACL3129.0001.001/123|editor=William Smith |page=108 |quote=It was fabled, that during the seven days before, and as many after, the shortest day of the year, while the bird ἀλκυών, was breeding, there always prevailed calms at sea.[/tpl]) during which Alcyone (as a kingfisher) laid her eggs and made her nest on the beach and during which her father Aeolus, god of the winds, restrained the winds and calmed the waves so she could do so in safety. The phrase has since come to refer to any peaceful time.  Its proper meaning, however, is that of a lucky break, or a bright interval set in the midst of adversity; just as the days of calm and mild weather are set in the height of winter for the sake of the kingfishers' egglaying.
The myth is also briefly referred to by Virgil, again without reference to Zeus's anger.Virgil Georgics i. 399 - "that time not to the sun's warmth then upon the shore / Do halcyons dear to Thetis ope their wings"

The Pacific-12 Conference (Pac-12) is a collegiate athletic conference that operates in the Western United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition. The conference's 12 members, which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective regions, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment, compete in 22 NCAA sports. It was created after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), whose principal members founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959, and went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, Pacific-10, and became the Pacific-12 in 2011.
Nicknamed the "Conference of Champions," the Pac-12 has won more NCAA National Team Championships than any other conference in history; the three schools with the most NCAA team championships belong to the Pac-12 (UCLA, Stanford, and USC, in that order). With Arizona State's softball title in 2011, the conference won its 400th NCAA Championship.
The current commissioner of the conference is Larry Scott who replaced Thomas C. Hansen, who retired in July 2009 after 26 years in that position.

[[La Niña]]

CATEGORIES: Climate, Climatology, Tropical meteorology, Physical oceanography, Weather hazards, Pacific Ocean, Spanish words and phrases

La Niña ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ɑː|ˈ|n|iː|n|j|ə|[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|la ˈniɲa[/tpl]) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that is the counterpart of El Niño as part of the broader El Niño–Southern Oscillation climate pattern. During a period of La Niña, the sea surface temperature across the equatorial Eastern Central Pacific Ocean will be lower than normal by 3–5 °C.  In the United States, an appearance of La Niña happens for at least five months of La Niña conditions. The name La Niña originates from Spanish, meaning "little girl," analogous to El Niño meaning "little boy."
La Niña, sometimes informally called "anti-El Niño", is the opposite of El Niño, where the latter corresponds instead to a higher sea surface temperature by a deviation of at least 0.5 °C, and its effects are often the reverse of those of El Niño. El Niño is known for its potentially catastrophic impact on the weather along the Chilean, Peruvian, New Zealand, and Australian coasts, among others. It has extensive effects on the weather in North America, even affecting the Atlantic Hurricane Season. La Niña often, though not always, follows an El Niño.

[[Giants (Greek mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Greek legendary creatures, Greek mythology, Gigantes, Offspring of Gaia

In Greek mythology,  the Giants or Gigantes (Greek: Γίγαντες, Gigantes, singular Gigas) were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size, known for the Gigantomachy, their battle with the Olympian gods, who were unable to defeat the Giants without the aid of the hero Heracles.Hansen, pp. 177–179; Gantz, pp. 445–454. According to Hesiod, the Giants were the children of Gaia (Earth) and her husband  Uranus (Sky), born from the blood that fell upon Gaia when Uranus was castrated by their son Cronus.Hesiod, Theogony 185. Hyginus gives Tartarus as the father of the Giants. A parallel to the Giants' birth is the birth of Aphrodite from the similarly fertilized sea.
Archaic and Classical representations always show the Giants as man-sized hoplites wearing armor, fully human in form.Gantz, pp. 446, 447. Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Giants with snakes for legs.Gantz, p. 453; Hammond, "Giants". In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with the Titans and other opponents of the Olympians.
Giants, buried under the ground, were thought to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.See for example Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana 5.16; Philostratus of Lemnos?, Imagines 2.17.5; Claudian, Rape of Proserpine 1.154–159; Mayor p. 262.

[[Estuary]]

CATEGORIES: Estuaries, Geodesy, Coastal geography, Fisheries, Coastal and oceanic landforms, Bodies of water

An estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.[tpl]cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. W. |year=1967 |chapter=What is an estuary: physical viewpoint |pages=3–5 |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=Lauf |title=Estuaries |series=A.A.A.S. Publ. |volume=83 |location=Washington, DC [/tpl]
Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.[tpl]cite book |last=McLusky |first=D. S. |last2=Elliott |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=The Estuarine Ecosystem: Ecology, Threats and Management |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-852508-7 [/tpl]
Most existing estuaries were formed during the Holocene epoch by the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolanski |first=E. |year=2007 |title=Estuarine Ecohydrology |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-53066-0 [/tpl] Estuaries are typically classified by their geomorphological features or by water circulation patterns and can be referred to by many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline.
The banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world, with about 60% of the world's population living along estuaries and the coast. As a result, many estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation, overgrazing, and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.

Dimocarpus longan, commonly known as the longan, is a tropical tree that produces edible fruit.  It is one of the better-known tropical members of the soapberry family, to which the lychee also belongs. It is native to Southern Asia. 
The longan ([tpl]zh|龙眼|hp=lóng yǎn|l=Dragon Eye[/tpl]), is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris). The seed is small, round and hard, and of an enamel-like, lacquered black.  The fully ripened, freshly harvested shell is bark-like, thin, and firm, making the fruit easy to shell by squeezing the fruit out as if one is "cracking" a sunflower seed.  When the shell has more moisture content and is more tender, the fruit becomes less convenient to shell.  The tenderness of the shell varies due to either premature harvest, variety, weather conditions, or transport/storage conditions. In China, it is also called guì yuán ([tpl]lang|zh-hans|桂圆[/tpl]), especially when dried.

[[Canyon]]

CATEGORIES: Canyons and gorges, Erosion landforms, Fluvial landforms

A canyon or gorge is a deep ravine between pairs of escarpments or cliffs and is most often carved from the landscape by the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevation—which is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon,http://www.mountainnature.com/Geology/Canyons.htm particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. 
A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks, such as those in ranges including the Rocky Mountains, the Alps, the Himalayas or the Andes. Usually a river or stream and erosion carve out such splits between mountains. Examples of mountain-type canyons are Provo Canyon in Utah or Yosemite National Park in California's Sierra Nevada. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side are called box canyons. Slot canyons are very narrow canyons, often with smooth walls.

[[Evapotranspiration]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrology, Climatology, Agronomy, Ecological processes, Irrigation, Water conservation, Water and the environment

Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land and ocean surface to the atmosphere. Evaporation accounts for the movement of water to the air from sources such as the soil, canopy interception, and waterbodies. Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves. Evapotranspiration is an important part of the water cycle.  An element (such as a tree) that contributes to evapotranspiration can be called an evapotranspirator.http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2000/0031.pdf
Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is a representation of the environmental demand for evapotranspiration and represents the evapotranspiration rate of a short green crop, completely shading the ground, of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile. It is a reflection of the energy available to evaporate water, and of the wind available to transport the water vapour from the ground up into the lower atmosphere. Actual evapotranspiration is said to equal potential evapotranspiration when there is ample water.

[[Rock shelter]]

CATEGORIES: Rock shelters

A rock shelter (also known as a rockhouse, crepuscular cave, or abri) is a shallow cave-like opening at the base of a bluff or cliff.
Rock shelters form because a rock stratum such as sandstone that is resistant to erosion and weathering has formed a cliff or bluff, but a softer stratum, more subject to erosion and weathering, lies just below the resistant stratum, and thus undercuts the cliff.
Many rock shelters are found under waterfalls.
Rock shelters are often important archaeologically. Because rock shelters form natural shelters from the weather, prehistoric humans often used them as living-places, and left behind debris, tools, and other artifacts. In mountainous areas the shelters can also be important for mountaineers. In western Connecticut and eastern New York, many rock shelters are known by the colloquialism "leatherman caves",CT Museum: Leatherman Caves as they were inhabited by the Leatherman over three decades in the late 19th century.
In arid areas, wind erosion (eolian erosion) can be an important factor in rockhouse formation. In most humid areas, the most important factor in rockhouse formation is frost spalling, where the softer, more porous rock underneath is pushed off, tiny pieces at a time, by frost expansion from water frozen in the pores. Erosion from moving water is seldom a significant factor.
The Cumberland stitchwort (Minuartia cumberlandensis) is an endangered species of plant which is found only in rock shelters in Kentucky and Tennessee.Center for Plant Conservation

In the case of bodies with substantial atmospheres, such as the Earth's atmosphere, the exosphere is the uppermost layer, where the atmosphere thins out and merges with interplanetary space. It is located directly above the thermosphere.
Several moons, such as Earth's moon and the Galilean satellites, have exospheres without a denser atmosphere underneath. Here molecules are ejected from surface rocks and follow independent parabolic trajectories until they collide with the surface. Authors differ as to whether such moons are considered to have atmospheres or not. Smaller bodies such as asteroids, in which the molecules emitted from the surface escape to space, are not considered to have exospheres.

[[Natural arch]]

CATEGORIES: Natural arches, Coastal and oceanic landforms, Coastal geography, Erosion landforms

A natural arch or natural bridge is a natural rock formation where a rock arch forms, with an opening underneath.  Most natural arches form as a narrow bridge, walled by cliffs, become narrower from erosion, with a softer rock stratum under the cliff-forming stratum gradually eroding out until the rock shelters thus formed meet underneath the ridge, thus forming the arch. Natural arches commonly form where cliffs are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes); the processes "find" weaknesses in rocks and work on them, making them larger until they break through.
The choice between bridge and arch is somewhat arbitrary. The Natural Arch and Bridge Society identifies a bridge as a subtype of arch that is primarily water-formed.Natural Arch and Bridge Society, FAQ. By contrast, the Dictionary of Geological Terms defines a natural bridge as a "natural arch that spans a valley of erosion."

Philip V (c.1292/1293 – 3 January 1322), the Tall ([tpl]lang-fr|Philippe le Long[/tpl]), was King of France,  King of Navarre as Philip II, and Count of Champagne. He reigned from 1316 to his death and was the penultimate monarch of the main line of the House of Capet.
As the second son of king Philip IV, Philip the Tall was made Count of Poitiers while his elder brother, Louis X, inherited the throne in 1314. When Louis died in 1316, his wife was pregnant and it was decided that Philip the Tall would act as regent until she gave birth to her child. She had a boy who was proclaimed king as John I, but the small king lived only for five days.
Philip was immediately crowned at Reims as Philip V. However, his legitimacy was challenged by Joan of Navarre, Louis X’s daughter, who claimed the throne of France for herself. Philip V successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General's determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne, according to the ancient Salic law.
Philip V restored somewhat good relations with the County of Flanders, which had entered into open rebellion during his father’s rule, but simultaneously his relations with Edward II of England worsened as the English king, who was also Duke of Guyenne, initially refused to pay him homage.
A spontaneous and popular crusade started in Normandy in 1320 which aimed to liberate Iberia from the Moors. Instead the angry populace marched to the south attacking castles, royal officials, priests, lepers and Jews.
Philip V engaged in a series of domestic reforms intended to improve the management of the kingdom. These reforms included the creation of an independent Court of Finances, the standardization of weights and measures, and the establishment of a single currency.
Philip V died from dysentery in 1322 without a male heir and was succeeded by his younger brother Charles IV.

Charles IV  (Clermont 18/19 June 1294 – Vincennes  1 February 1328), called the Fair (French: le Bel) was Count of Champagne, King of Navarre (as Charles I) and the last "direct" Capetian King of France from 1322 to his death.
Charles was the third son of Philip IV; like his father, he was known as "the fair" or "the handsome".Kibler, p.201.  From 1323, Charles was confronted to a peasant revolt in Flanders and, in 1324, he unsuccessfully bid the elective German monarchy.
As duke of Guyenne, Edward II of England was Charles’s vassal but was reluctant to pay homage to another king. In retaliation, Charles conquered the Duchy of Guyenne in a conflict known as the War of Saint-Sardos (1324). In a peace agreement, Edward II accepted to swear allegiance to Charles and to pay a fine. In exchange, Guyenne was returned to Edward but with a much-reduced territory.
When Charles IV died without male heir, the senior lineage of the House of Capet ended; he was succeeded by his cousin Philip of Valois, but the contested legitimacy was one factor of the Hundred Years' War.

The brothers wanted to storm Mt. Olympus and gain Artemis for Otus and Hera for Ephialtes. Their plan, or construction, of a pile of mountains atop which they would confront the gods is described differently according to the author (including Homer, Vergil, and Ovid), and occasionally changed by translators. Mount Olympus is usually said to be on the bottom mountain, with Mounts Ossa and Pelion upon Ossa as second and third, either respectively or vice versa. Homer says they were killed by Apollo before they had any beards,Odyssey 11.319–20. consistent with their being bound to columns in the Underworld by snakes, with the nymph of the Styx in the form of an owl over them.Hyginus.
According to another version of their struggle against the Olympians, alluded to so brieflyIt is related in the Iliad by the goddess Dione to her daughter Aphrodite that it must have been already familiar to the epic's hearers, they managed to kidnap Ares and hold him in a bronze jar, a storage pithos, for thirteen months, a lunar year. "And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants' stepmother, had not told Hermes what they had done," Dione related (Iliad 5.385–391).

Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands is a terrestrial biome whose predominant vegetation consists of grasses and/or shrubs. The climate is temperate and ranges from semi-arid to semi-humid.
Steppes/shortgrass prairies are short grasslands that occur in semi-arid climates. Tallgrass prairies are tall grasslands in areas of higher rainfall. Heaths and pastures are, respectively, low shrublands and grasslands where forest growth is hindered by human activity but not climate.
Tall grasslands, including the tallgrass prairie of North America and the Humid Pampas of Argentina, have moderate rainfall and rich soils which make them ideally suited to extensive agriculture, and tall grassland ecoregions include some of the most productive grain-growing regions in the world. 
Savannas are areas with both grass and trees, but the trees do not form a canopy as they would in a forest.

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Women in Greek mythology, Aeolides

In Greek mythology, Canace ([tpl]Lang-el|Κανάκη[/tpl]) was a daughter of Aeolus and Enarete,Hesiod, Catalogue of Women fr. 10(a) Pap. Turner, fr. 1-3, col. I-II, 25-75 and lover of Poseidon.Callimachus, Hymn to Demeter 99: Triopas mentions Canace as his mother by Poseidon Her brothers were Athamas, Cretheus, Deioneus, Magnes, Perieres, Salmoneus and Sisyphus.  Her sisters were Alcyone, Arne, Calyce, Peisidice, Perimede and Tanagra. With Poseidon, she was the mother of Aloeus, Epopeus, Hopleus, Nireus and Triopas.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 1. 7. 3 - 4
In another, more famous version Canace was a lover not of Poseidon, but of her own brother Macareus. This tradition made them children of a different Aeolus, the lord of the winds (or the Tyrrhenian king),These two are barely distinct in any case; see the article on Aeolus for discussion and his wife Amphithea. Canace fell in love with Macareus and committed incest with him, which resulted in her getting pregnant. Macareus promised to marry Canace but never did. When their child was born, Canace's nurse tried to take the baby out of the palace in a basket, pretending to be carrying a sacrificial offering, but the baby cried out and revealed itself. Aeolus was outraged and compelled Canace to commit suicide as punishment, sending her a sword with which she was to stab herself. He also exposed the newborn child to its death. This story was told by Latin poet Ovid in the Heroides, a selection of eighteen story-poems that pretend to be letters from mythological women to their lovers and ex-lovers.Ovid, Heroides, 11 The story is also briefly referred to by HyginusHyginus, Fabulae, 238 (Aeolus kills Canace), 242 (Macareus kills himself after Canace's death), 243 (Canace kills herself over her forbidden love for Macareus) and retold by Pseudo-Plutarch, in whose account Macareus kills himself over the matter as well.Pseudo-Plutarch, Greek and Roman parallel Stories, 28 It was also the subject of Euripides' lost play Aeolus, on which the extant versions appear to be based.
Her story was also put to the stage in the verse tragedy Canace (1588), by Italian playwright Sperone Speroni, as well as being the subject of a tale in Gower's Confessio Amantis.

[[Taut-line hitch]]

The taut-line hitch is an adjustable loop knot for use on lines under tension.  It is useful when the length of a line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension.  It is made by tying a rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object.  Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot.
It is typically used for securing tent lines in outdoor activities involving camping, by arborists when climbing trees,[tpl]Citation|first=Mark|last=Adams|title=Son of a Hitch: A Genealogy of Arborists' Climbing Hitches|url=http://www.treebuzz.com/pdf/0505_geneology.pdf|publisher=International Society of Arboriculture|journal=Arborist News|date=April 2005[/tpl] for creating adjustable moorings in tidal areas,[tpl]Citation|first=Brion|last=Toss|title=The Complete Rigger's Apprentice|location=Camden|publisher=International Marine|year=1998|pages=54–55[/tpl] and to secure loads on vehicles.

Alope left the infant in the open to die of exposure, but a passing mare suckled the child until it was found by shepherds, who fell into a dispute as to who was to have the beautiful royal attire of the boy.  The case was brought before Cercyon, who, on recognizing by the dress whose child the boy was, ordered Alope to be imprisoned in order to be put to death, and her child to be exposed again. The latter was fed and found in the same manner as before, and the shepherds called him Hippothoon. The body of Alope was changed by Poseidon into a spring, which bore the same name.Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 5. § 2Aristophanes, Birds 533

Cercyon ([tpl]lang-el|Κερκύων, -ονος[/tpl]) was a figure in Greek mythology. He was the King of Eleusis, and a very strong man. According to the different versions, he was the son of:
He had two children, Alope and Hippothous.
He stood on the roads around Eleusis and challenged passers-by to a wrestling match. The loser (always the passer-by) was murdered, though Cercyon promised his kingdom to anyone who won. He was eventually beaten and killed by Theseus, who took over the kingdom of Eleusis. Theseus won owing to his skill, rather than superiority in brute physical strength. With this, Theseus started the sport of wrestling.   Pausanias, writing in the Roman era, tells this story in his "Description of Greece" (1.39.3); Bacchylides alludes to the event in his 18th Ode, written in the fifth century BC. 
Cercyon's daughter, Alope, had an affair with (or was raped by) Poseidon, and she beget Hippothoon (or Hippothous). Cercyon had his daughter buried alive, but Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis.

[[Horse latitudes]]
CATEGORIES: Lines of latitude, Age of Sail

Horse latitudes or subtropical highs are subtropical latitudes  between 30 and 35 degrees both north and south. This region, under a ridge of high pressure called the subtropical high, is an area which receives little precipitation and has variable winds mixed with calm. 
The horse latitudes are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of air from high-altitude currents moving toward the poles. After reaching the earth's surface, this air spreads toward the equator as part of the prevailing trade winds or toward the poles as part of the westerlies. The belt in the Northern Hemisphere is sometimes called the "calms of Cancer" and that in the Southern Hemisphere the "calms of Capricorn".
The consistently warm, dry conditions of the horse latitudes also contribute to the existence of temperate deserts, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and parts of the Middle East in the Northern Hemisphere; and the Atacama Desert, the Kalahari Desert, and the Australian Desert in the Southern Hemisphere.

Quintus SmyrnaeusQuintus Smyrnaeus, Posthomericai.18ff. explains more fully than pseudo-Apollodorus how Penthesilea came to be at Troy: Penthesilea had killed Hippolyta with a spear when they were hunting deer; this accident caused Penthesilea so much grief that she wished only to die, but, as a warrior and an Amazon, she had to do so honorably and in battle.

Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released eight studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.
Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990's country rock sound to a current "eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres."[tpl]cite web |date=September 25, 2012 |title=Indie-Rockers Wilco Make First Appearance At The Cascade Theatre Sept 26 |url=http://anewscafe.com/2012/09/25/indie-rockers-wilco-make-first-appearance-at-the-cascade-theatre-sept-26/ |author=Press Release[/tpl]
Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."[tpl]cite news|last=Fricke|first=David|authorlink=David Fricke|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot|title=Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (review)|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=May 9, 2002|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070912001355/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/albums/album/322307/review/5946403/yankee_hotel_foxtrot |archivedate = September 12, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Last accessed July 18, 2007.

Carambola, also known as starfruit, is the fruit of Averrhoa carambola, a species of tree native to the Philippines,  Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The fruit is popular throughout Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and parts of East Asia. The tree is also cultivated throughout non-indigenous tropical areas, such as in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the southern United States.
The fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually five, but can sometimes vary); in cross-section, it resembles a star, hence its name. The entire fruit is edible and is usually eaten out of hand. They may also be used in cooking, and can be made into relishes, preserves, and juice drinks.

Ampelos ([tpl]lang|grc|ἄμπελος[/tpl]) is the Ancient Greek for  "vine".
In an etiology told by Nonnus, the vine is personified as a beautiful satyr youth, who was loved by Dionysus, and whose death was foreseen by the god. There are two versions of his death and Dionysus’s reaction to it. 
According to Nonnus, Ampelos was gored to death by a wild bull after he mocked the goddess Selene, a scene described as follows:
Upset by his death, Dionysus transformed Ampelos’s body into the first grape vine and created wine from his blood. 
The second version involves grape vines in a different manner. According to Ovid: 
Ampelose (singular: Ampelos) were also a variety of hamadryad.

[[Inachus]]

CATEGORIES: Sea and river gods, Greek gods, Greek mythology, Kings of Argos, Ancient Argolis

In Greek mythology, Inachus ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἴναχος[/tpl]) was the first king of Argos after whom a river was called Inachus River,Apollodorus, Library, Apollod. 2.1 the modern Panitsa that drains the western margin of the Argive plain.TheoiProject:Inakhos 
The historian Pausanias describes him as the eldest king of Argos who named the river after himself and sacrificed to Hera.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2.15.4 He also notes that some said he was not a mortal, but a river. He states that Inachus, Cephissus and Asterion were mediators in a land dispute between Poseidon and Hera; when they judged for Hera, Poseidon took away their water (elsewhere he writes that Poseidon flooded the region as his revenge). He mentions Dinomenes (Io) and Mycene as daughters of Inachus. 
Though Jerome and Eusebius (both citing Castor of Rhodes), and as even late as 1812 John Lemprière[tpl]cite book  | last =Lemprière  | first =John   | title =A classical dictionary  | publisher =  | year =1812  | location =Original from Oxford University  | pages =  | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=KiIIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT456&dq=Lyrcus&lr=&as_brr=1&ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =  | id =  [/tpl] euhemeristically asserted that he was the first king of Argos, and Robert Graves that he was a descendant of Iapetus, most modern mythologists understand Inachus as one of the river gods, all sons of Oceanus and Tethys and thus to the Greeks part of the pre-Olympian or "Pelasgian" mythic landscape; in Greek iconography, Walter Burkert notes,Burkert, Greek Religion, 1985: "Nature deities" 3.3, p.175 the rivers are represented in the form of a bull with a human head or face. In the Danaan founding myth, Poseidon had dried up the springs of the Argolid out of anger at Inachus for testifying that the land belonged to the ancient goddess, Hera; to counter this drought, Danaus sent his daughters to draw water. One of them, Amymone, in her search lay with Poseidon, and he revealed to her the springs at Lerna.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 2.1.4 (TheoiProject: on-line text).  
As rivers are generally fertile, Inachus had many children, the chief of whom were his two sons, Phoroneus and Aegialeus or Phegeus, and his two daughters, Io and Philodice, wife of Leucippus. The mother of these children was variously described in the sources, either the primeval ash-tree nymph Melia, called the mother of Phoroneus and Aegialeus, or Argia (his sister), called the mother of Phoroneus and Io. Io is sometimes confused as the daughter of Inachus and Melia but she is the daughter of Inachus alone. Io was born from Inachus' mouth technically making her Inachus and Melia's daughter because she was born while Inachus was married to Melia.
Aside from the Inachians of whom he was simply the back-formed eponym, his other children include Mycene, the spirit of Mycenae, the spring nymph Amymone, Messeis, Hyperia, and possibly Teledice.
In one founding myth of Argos, Inachos founded the city after rendering the province of Argolis inhabitable again, following the deluge of Deucalion.
Sophocles wrote an Inachos, probably a  satyr play, which survives only in some papyrus fragments found at Oxyrhyncus and Tebtunis, Egypt; in it Inachos is reduced from magnificence to misery through the unrequited love of ZeusPerhaps Chthonic Zeus, Zeus-Plouton, Richard Seaford suggests (Richard Seaford, "Black Zeus in Sophocles' Inachos" The Classical Quarterly New Series, 30.1 (1980), pp. 23-29. for his daughter Io; Hermes wears the cap of darkness, rendering him invisible, but plays the aulos, to the mystification of the satyrs; Argos and Iris, as a messenger of Hera both appear, a "stranger" turns Io into a heifer at the touch of a hand, and at the end, apparently, the satyrs are freed from their bondage, to become shepherds of Inachos., Die Netzfischer des Aischylos und der Inachos des Sophokles (Munich: Beck) 1938. An additional papyrus fragment of Sophocles' Inachos was published in 1960.Rudolph Pfeiffer, Ein neues Inachos-Fragment des Sophokles (Munich:Beck) 1958; R.J. Carden, The Papyrus Fragments of Sophocles (de Gruyter) 1974.
In Virgil's Aeneid, Inachus is represented on Turnus's shield. Compare the Inachos or Brimos of the Eleusinian Mysteries.

[[Phoroneus]]

CATEGORIES: Kings in Greek mythology, Kings of Argos, Greek culture heroes

In Greek mythology, Phoroneus[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl] (Φορωνεύς) was a culture-hero of the Argolid, fire-bringer, primordial king of Argos and son of the river god Inachus and either Melia, the primordial ash-tree nymphSee Meliai, the ash-tree nymphs. or Argia, the embodiment of the Argolid itself:  "Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat PhoroneusThe Argive myth was reported to Pausanias, (Description of Greece, 2.15.5). by his sister Argia," wrote Hyginus, in Fabulae 143. Hyginus' genealogy expresses the position of Phoroneus as oneIn the Argolid, of course, he displaced Prometheus as the primordial fire-giver and the originator of kingship (Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger, eds. Greek and Egyptian Mythologies, "Myths of Argos and Athens" of Chicago 1992:124). of the primordial men, whose local identities differed in the various regions of Greece,See Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks, 1951 (1980), p. 222, for other primordial men: Prometheus and Epimetheus, and, in Boeotia, Alkomeneus. and who had for a mother the essential spirit of the  very earth of Argos herself, Argia. He was the primordial king in the Peloponnesus, authorized by Zeus: "Formerly Zeus himself had ruled over men, but Hermes created a confusion of human speech, which spoiled Zeus' pleasure in this Rule".Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks 1951 (1980), p. 222. Phoroneus introduced both the worship of Hera and the use of fire and the forge.Hyginus. Fabulae, 143. Compare Prometheus. Poseidon and Hera had vied for the land: when the primeval waters had receded, Phoroneus "was the first to gather the people together into a community; for they had up to then been living as scattered and lonesome families". (Pausanias). 
Phoroneus was said to have been married to Cinna,Hyginus, Fabulae, 145 or Cerdo,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2. 21. 1 or Teledice (or Laodice) the nymph,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 1. 1Tzetzes on Lycophron 177 or Perimede,Scholia on Pindar, Olympian Ode 3. 28 or first to Peitho and second to Europe,Scholia on Euripides, Orestes, 932 and to have fathered a number of children, some of whom are dealt with below; others include Apis (Greek mythology), Car,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 1. 39. 5 Chthonia, Clymenus,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2. 35. 4 Sparton,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2. 16. 4 LyrcusParthenius, Love Romances, 1 and Europs, an illegitimate son.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 2. 34. 4 An unnamed daughter of his is said to have consorted with Hecaterus.Strabo, Geography, 10. 3. 19
In Argive culture, Niobe is associated with Phoroneus, sometimes as his mother, sometimes as his daughter, or else, likely, as his consort (Kerenyi). His successor was Argus, who was Niobe's son, either by Zeus or Phoroneus himself. He was also the father of Apis, who may have also ruled Argos (according to TatiānusJames Cowles Prichard : An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology. 1819. p. 85). He was  worshipped in Argos with an eternal fire that was shown to Pausanias in the 2nd century CE, and funeral sacrifices were offered to him at his tomb-sanctuary.Pausanias, 2. 20.3.
In another story, according to Hellanicus of Lesbos, Phoroneus had at least three sons: Agenor, Jasus and Pelasgus, and that after the death of Phoroneus, the two elder brothers divided his dominions between themselves in such a manner that Pelasgus received the country about the river Erasmus, and built Larissa, and Iasus the country about Elis.  After the death of these two, Agenor, the youngest, invaded their dominions, and thus became king of Argos.Hellanicus of Lesbos, Fragm. p. 47, ed.

[[Amymone]]
CATEGORIES: Danaids, Mortal parents of demigods in Classical mythology

In Greek mythology, Amymone (the "blameless" one) was a daughter of Danaus. As the "blameless" Danaid, her name identifies her as, perhaps, identical to Hypermnestra ("great wooing" or "high marriage"), also the one Danaid who did not assassinate her Egyptian husband on their wedding night, as her 49 sisters did. (See the myth at the entry for Danaus.) The author of the Bibliotheca, in his list of names for the Danaids, does mention both Hypermnestra and Amymone, however. (Library 2.1.5)
Poseidon, in archaic times the consort of the two goddesses Demeter and Persephone in Argos,[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] had dried up all the region's springs after the Argolid was awarded to the protection of Hera. It would appear from the myth that Poseidon preceded Hera in the heartland of her cult. But he rescued Amymone from a chthonic satyr that was about to rape her. To possess her himself, the god revealed the springs of Lerna, a cult site of great antiquity near the shores of the Argolid. To Poseidon she bore Nauplius, "the navigator," who gave his name to the port city of Argos.
Amymone, the blameless, was eventually reconciled with her father, and given in marriage to Lynceus, with whom she founded a race of kings that led to Danae, the mother of Perseus, founder of Mycenae. Thus this founding myth of Argos also asserts that Argos was the metropolis ("mother city") of Mycenae.   
Amymone/Hypermnestra is represented with a water pitcher, a reminder of the sacred springs and lake of Lerna and of the copious wells that made Argos the "well-watered" and, by contrast, a reminder that her sisters were forever punished in Tartarus for their murderous crimes by fruitlessly drawing water in pitchers with open bases.
Aeschylus wrote a now lost satyr play called Amymore about the seduction of Amymore by Poseidon, which followed the trilogy that included The Suppliants.

Johannes "Hans" Wilhelm "Gengar" Geiger (30 September 1882 – 24 September 1945) was a German physicist. He is perhaps best known as the co-inventor of the Geiger counter and for the Geiger–Marsden experiment which discovered the atomic nucleus. Geiger was born at Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany. He was one of five children born to the Indologist Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger, who was professor at the University of Erlangen.
In 1902, Geiger started studying physics and mathematics in University of Erlangen and was awarded a doctorate in 1906.[ref]
</ref> In 1907 he began work with [[Ernest Rutherford]] at the [[University of Manchester]] and in 1909, along with [[Ernest Marsden]], conducted the famous [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] called the "gold foil experiment".

He was a member of the Uranium Club. Geiger never expressed himself in public about the Nazis. There are reports both about him helping, and rejecting, Jewish colleagues. Geiger died in Potsdam, Germany a few months after World War II ended. He had four siblings: three sisters and one brother that were all younger than him.  His brother, Rudolph, was very interested in meteorology and climatology.?

In Greek mythology, Rhoeo ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|oʊ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ῥοιώ[/tpl]) was a daughter of Staphylus and Chrysothemis, sister to Parthenos and Molpadia or Hemithea. Parthenius relates that she once experienced a great jealosy of her sister Hemithea when Staphylus arranged for the latter to spend a night with Lyrcus, his guest, whom both Hemithea and Rhoeo fell in love with.Parthenius, Love Romances, 1 
She became the lover of Apollo and by him the mother of Anius. When her father discovered her pregnancy, he believed she was impregnated by a man rather than a god. He placed her in a chest and cast her out to sea (parallel to Danae and Perseus).  She landed on the island of Delos, which was sacred to Apollo. She gave birth to a son on the island and named him Anius (as if from [tpl]lang|grc|ἀνιάομαι[/tpl] "to suffer"); she then put him on the altar of Apollo and prayed to the god that the baby be saved if it was his. Apollo concealed the child for some time, taught him the art of divination and granted him with certain honors.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62Tzetzes on Lycophron, 570 
Rhoeo eventually married Zarex, son of Carystus or Carycus, who accepted Anius as his own, and had two more children with him.Tzetzes on Lycophron, 580 Later, Anius became a priest of Apollo and gave aid to Aeneas and his retinue when they were travelling from Troy to the future site of Rome.
One source mentions Rhoeo as a possible mother of Jason with Aeson.Tzetzes, Chiliades, 6. 979 - 980

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Offspring of Apollo, Mythological Greek seers

In Greek mythology, Anius ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἄνιος[/tpl]) was a king of Delos and priest of Apollo. He was the son of Apollo and Rhoeo, daughter of Staphylus and Chrysothemis. 
Anius was born either on the island of Delos, which was sacred to his father Apollo, or on Euboea, after the box in which his mother had been placed by Staphylus when he had discovered her pregnancy was washed ashore there. Rhoeo then, placing the baby on Apollo's altar, challenged the god to care for it, if it was his.Tripp, Edward. The Meridian Handbook of Classical Mythology. Meridian, 1970, p. 52. Rhoeo then married Zarex, who thus became the legal father of Anius. Apollo cared for the child Anius for a time, teaching him the arts of divination and prophecy. Anius later became his priest.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62Tzetzes on Lycophron, 570, 580  
Anius had three daughters: Oeno, Spermo, and Elais, known as the Oenotropae; and three sons, Andros, Mykonos, and Thasos. Their mother was Dorippe, a Thracian woman ransomed by Anius for the price of a horse from the pirates who had kidnapped her.Etymologicum Magnum 293. 39, ed. by Friedrich Sylburg, p. 266 (under Δωρίππη) Dionysus gave the three daughters the power to change whatever they wanted into wine, wheat, and oil.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, Epitome of Book IV, 3. 10 When the Greeks landed on Delos while on their way to Troy, Anius prophesized that the Trojan War would not be won until the tenth year, and insisted that they stay with him for nine years, promising that his daughters would supply them with aliments during that period. When Agamemnon heard this, he wanted to take the Oenotropae with him by force, to provide his army with food and wine. They prayed to Dionysus, who changed them into doves.Ovid, Metamorphoses, 13. 631-640, where they are said to have actually been carried off by Agamemnon and to have escaped, before their transformation took placeServius' commentary on Virgil, Aeneid, 3. 80
Of Anius's three sons, Andros and Mykonos became eponyms of the islands of Andros and Mykonos respectively.Stephanus of Byzantium, s. vv. Andros, Mykonos As for Thasos, he was devoured by dogs, and since then it was prohibited to keep dogs on Delos.Ovid, Ibis, 477Hyginus, Fabulae, 247, where he is called "Thasius" 
Later, Anius, an old friend of Anchises, gave aid to him, his son Aeneas, and his retinue when they were fleeing from Troy and en route to the future site of Rome.Virgil, Aeneid, 3. 80-83, with Servius's commentaryOvid, Metamorphoses, 13. 622 ff According to a rare version of the myth, Aeneas married Anius's daughter Lavinia (or Launa), who, like her father, had prophetic abilities and bore Aeneas a son, who was also named Anius.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1. 59Aurelius Victor, Origo Gentis Romanae, 9

[[Milkweed butterfly]]
CATEGORIES: Nymphalidae, Danainae

Milkweed butterflies are a subfamily, Danainae, in the family Nymphalidae, or brush-footed butterflies. They lay their eggs on various milkweeds on which their larvae (caterpillars) feed. Historically, this group had been considered a separate family, Danaidae, and the tribes placed herein were sometimes considered distinct subfamilies in the Nymphalidae.
There are some 300 species of Danainae worldwide. Most of the Danaini are found in tropical Asia and Africa, while the Ithomiini are diverse in the Neotropics. Tellervini are restricted to Australia and the Oriental region. Four species are found in North America: the Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus); the Queen (Danaus gilippus); the Tropical Milkweed Butterfly (Lycorea cleobaea); and the Soldier Butterfly (or "Tropic Queen"; Danaus eresimus).
The best known member of this family is the Monarch butterfly. The larvae and the butterflies retain poisonous glycosides from their larval host plant, the milkweed, so they become distasteful to potential predators. These milkweed butterflies (Monarch, Queen, Soldier) eat only milkweeds (Asclepias) as larvae.  This highly effective defense strategy shields them against almost all predators that soon learn to avoid these species after attempting to eat them.
Another member known especially for its presence in butterfly greenhouses and live butterfly expositions is the Southeast Asian Idea leuconoe.
The fossil milkweed butterfly Archaeolycorea is known from the Oligocene or Miocene Tremembé Formation of Brazil. It often assigned to tribe Danaini, specifically subtribe Euploeina, but this may or may not be correct. In any case, it provides evidence that the present family originated more than 20-30 million years ago.

[[The Raven]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry by Edgar Allan Poe, Fictional ravens, 1845 poems, Narrative poems, Works originally published in The American Review: A Whig Journal

"The Raven" is a narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student,Meyers, 163Silverman, 239 is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further instigate his distress with its constant repetition of the word "Nevermore". The poem makes use of a number of folk and classical references.
Poe claimed to have written the poem very logically and methodically, intending to create a poem that would appeal to both critical and popular tastes, as he explained in his 1846 follow-up essay "The Philosophy of Composition". The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty by Charles Dickens.Kopley & Hayes, 192 Poe borrows the complex rhythm and meter of Elizabeth Barrett's poem "Lady Geraldine's Courtship", and makes use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout.
"The Raven" was first attributed to Poe in print in the New York Evening Mirror on January 29, 1845. Its publication made Poe widely popular in his lifetime, although it did not bring him much financial success. Soon reprinted, parodied, and illustrated, critical opinion is divided as to the poem's status, but it nevertheless remains one of the most famous poems ever written.Silverman, 237

[[Iobates]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Iobates ([tpl]lang-el|Ἰοβάτης[/tpl]), a.k.a. Jobates, was a Lycian king, the father of Antea and Philonoe. (This Iobatēs is sometimes named Amphianax.Pierre Grimal : A Concise Dictionary of Classical Mythology, s.v. "Stheneboea") Bellerophon was sent into exile to the land of King Iobates. Proetus, King of Tiryns,  wanted Iobates to kill Bellerophon, but Iobates feared the wrath of the gods if he murdered a guest. So he sent Bellerophon on a mission that he deemed impossible: to kill a fire-breathing monster, the Chimera.
An alternate version of the beginning of the quest is that Bellerophon encountered Proetus, who grew intensely jealous of him.  Proetus was the son-in-law of Iobates, and sent Bellerophon to him with a sealed message that asked him to kill Bellerophon. Lycia at the time was in the middle of a horrific plague and Iobates didn't want to strain the population with a war, which would surely result if he murdered Bellerophon. Instead, he sent him to kill the Chimera. 
The goddess Athena, realizing Bellerophon would surely die if he undertook this task alone, sent him aid in the form of the winged horse, Pegasus. Alternatively, Bellerophon sought out the wisest man in Lycia, Polyidus, who told him about the horse. To obtain the services of the winged horse, Polyidus told Bellerophon to sleep in the temple of Athena.  While Bellerophon slept, he dreamed of Athena setting a golden bridle down beside him; it was there when he awoke.  Bellerophon had to sneak up on Pegasus while it drank from a well (Polyidus told him which well).  
Bellerophon mounted his steed and flew off to where the Chimera was said to dwell. When he arrived, the Chimera was truly ferocious, and he could not harm the monster even while riding on Pegasus. He felt the heat of the Chimera's breath and was struck with an idea. He got a large block of lead and mounted it on his spear. He then flew head-on towards the Chimera, holding out the spear as far as he could. Before he broke off his attack, he managed to lodge the lead in the creature's throat. The beast's fire-breath melted the lead, and blocked its air passage. The Chimera suffocated, and Bellerophon returned to King Iobates victorious. Iobates was unable to believe that this valiant hero deserved death, and so he allowed Bellerophon to marry his daughter.  Alternatively, Iobates' daughter, Antea, loved Bellerophon.  He scorned her and she committed suicide.  Iobates' other daughter, Philonoe, had an affair with Bellerophon.

[[Autonous]]

CATEGORIES: Legendary birds, Metamorphoses in Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Autonous (Αὐτόνοος) was the son of Melaneus, husband of Hippodamia, was father to Anthus, Erodius, Schoenous, Acanthus and Acanthis, and an owner of a large herd of horses. The land they lived in produced no crops, but only rushes and thistles, that's why all the children of Autonous were named after such plants. Erodius, who loved his father's horses the most, pastured them on grassy meadows, but one day, Anthus drove them out of their familiar pastures. Out of hunger, the horses attacked Anthus and ate him. Autonous, striken by panic, could not help his son, and neither could Anthus' servant, while Hippodamia was trying to drive the horses off but failed due to her physical weakness. Zeus and Apollo, out of pity for the grieving family, transformed the members into birds. Autonous became a Stone Curlew (Greek όκνος, because he "was not in time",  όκνησε in Greek, to save Anthus), Hippodamia became a Lark (the bird has a crest which symbolizes her courage) and Acanthis became a thistle finch; others became birds whose Greek names are the same as their personal names were when they were humans. Erodius and Anthus' servant were transformed into black and white heron respectively; birds of these two species are never seen together.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 7Greek Mythology Link (Carlos Parada) - Metamorphoses

Akademos or Academus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|ə|ˈ|d|iː|m|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Ἀκάδημος[/tpl]; also Hekademos, Hecademus (Ἑκάδημος)), was an Attic hero in Greek mythology. 
Plutarch in his biography of the Athenian king Theseus (the slayer of the Minotaur) says that, after being widowed and reaching age 50, the King abducted the beautiful 12-year old Helen (long before she married Menealaus, met Paris and was the cause of the Trojan War). Due to this outrage her twin brothers Castor and Pollux invaded Attica to liberate their sister and threatened to destroy Athens. Akademos spared the city by telling them where she was (hidden at Aphidnae). For this Akademos was venerated by the city as a savior.[tpl]cite book|title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course|author=Roger L. Cooke|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2005[/tpl] Also for this reason the Tyndarids always showed him much gratitude, and whenever the Lacedaemonians invaded Attica, they always spared the land belonging to Academus which lay on the Cephissus, six stadia from Athens.Plutarch, Theseus 32Diogenes Laërtius iii. L § 9 
This piece of land was subsequently adorned with plane and olive plantations,Plutarch, Cimon 13 and was called Academia from its original owner.[tpl]Citation| last = Schmitz | first = Leonhard| author-link = Leonhard Schmitz| contribution = Academus| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = William| title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume = 1 | pages = 5| publisher =  | place = Boston| year = 1867 | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0014.html [/tpl]
This grove of trees on the northwest side of the city, held to be his burial place, was ever after dedicated to his memory. 
Within this grove Plato gave his lectures and thus the phrase "the groves of Academe."[tpl]cite book|title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course|author=Roger L. Cooke|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2005[/tpl] Due to this Akademos' name has been linked to the archaic name for the site of Plato's Academy, the Hekademeia, outside the walls of Athens. 
The site was sacred to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and other immortals; it had sheltered her religious cult since the Bronze Age, which was perhaps associated with the hero-gods, the Dioskouroi (Castor and Polydeukes), and of course for the hero Akademos. By classical times the name of the place had evolved into the Akademeia. Its sacred grove furnished the olive oil that was distributed as prizes in the Panathenaic Games and contained in the finely decorated Panathenaic amphorae presented to the winners.
Akademeia was the source of the word "academy". The expression "the Grove of Academe" refers to the sacred site of Hekademos where the cult had once taken place in an olive grove sacred to Athena.

[[Anteros]]

CATEGORIES: Love and lust gods, Greek gods, Offspring of Aphrodite, Offspring of Ares

In Greek mythology, Anteros ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀντέρως, Antérōs[/tpl]) was the god of requited love, literally "love returned" or "counter-love" and also the punisher of those who scorn love and the advances of others, or the avenger of unrequited love.
Anteros was the son of Ares and Aphrodite in Greek mythology, given to his brother Eros, who was lonely, as a playmate, the rationale being that love must be answered if it is to prosper. Alternatively, he was said to have arisen from the mutual love between Poseidon and Nerites.Aelian, On Animals, 14. 28 Physically, he is depicted as similar to Eros in every way, but with long hair and plumed butterfly wings. He has been described also as armed with either a golden club or arrows of lead.
Anteros, with Eros, was one of a host of winged love gods called Erotes, the ever-youthful winged gods of love, usually depicted as winged boys in the company of Aphrodite or her attendant goddesses.
An altar to this god was put up by the metics in Athens in commemoration of the spurned love of the metic Timagoras who was rejected by the Athenian Meles. Upon hearing Timagoras' declaration of love for him, the young man mockingly ordered him to throw himself down from the top of a tall rock. Seeing Timagoras dead, Meles repented and threw himself down from the same rock.Pausanias, 1.30.1.
Describing the nature of the emotion, Plato asserts that it is the result of the great love for another person. The lover, inspired by beauty, is filled with divine love and "filling the soul of the loved one with love in return."  As a result, the loved one falls in love with the lover, though the love is only spoken of as friendship. They experience pain when the two are apart, and relief when they are together, the mirror image of the lover's feelings, is anteros, or "counter-love."Phaedrus, 255.
Anteros is the subject of the Shaftesbury Memorial in Piccadilly Circus, London, where he symbolises the selfless philanthropic love of the Earl of Shaftesbury for the poor. The memorial is sometimes given the name The Angel of Christian Charity and is popularly mistaken for Eros.Lloyd & Mitchinson (2006) The book of general ignorance "Because of the bow and the nudity... everybody assumed it was Eros, the Greek god of love"

A fragment of Callimachus' Aitia ("Origins") appears to ask, "Why, at Sicyon, is it the hoopoe, and not the usual "splendid ravens", that is the bird of good omen?"The fragment is interpreted so by Noel Robertson, "Callimachus' Tale of Sicyon ('SH' 238)" Phoenix 53.1/2 (Spring 1999:57-79); Robertson continues by elucidating Epopeus.

Dirce ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɜr|s|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-grc|Δίρκη[/tpl], pronounced Dirke, modern Greek pronunciation Dirki, meaning "double" or "cleft") was the wife of Lycus in Greek mythology, and aunt to Antiope whom Zeus impregnated. Antiope fled in shame to King Epopeus of Sicyon, but was brought back by Lycus through force, giving birth to the twins Amphion and Zethus on the way. Dirce hated Antiope and treated her cruelly after Lycus gave Antiope to her; until Antiope, in time, escaped.
In Euripides' play Antiope, Antiope flees back to the cave where Amphion and Zethus were born, now living there as young men.  They disbelieve her claim to be their mother and refuse her pleas for sanctuary, but when Dirce comes to find Antiope and orders her to be killed, the twins are convinced by the shepherd who raised them that Antiope is their mother.  They kill Dirce by tying her to the horns of a bull.
Dirce was devoted to the god Dionysus. He caused a spring to flow where she died, either at Mount Cithaeron or at Thebes, and it was a local tradition for the outgoing Theban hipparch to swear in his successor at her tomb.Tripp, p. 213.

In Greek mythology, Melete (Μελέτη) was one of the three original (Boeotian) Muses, though there were later nine. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme.  She was the muse of thought and meditation.  Melete literally means "ponder" and "contemplation" in Greek.
According to Pausanias in the later 2nd century AD, there were three original Muses: Aoidē ("song" or "voice"), Meletē ("practice" or "occasion"), and Mnēmē ("memory"). Together, these three form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice. In Delphi three Muses were worshipped as well, but with other names: Nētē, Mesē, and Hypatē, which are the names of the three chords of the ancient musical instrument, the lyre. Alternatively they were called Cēphisso, Apollonis, and Borysthenis, whose names characterise them as daughters of Apollo. In later tradition, four Muses were recognized: Thelxinoē, Aoedē, Archē, and Meletē, said to be daughters of Zeus and Plusia (or of Uranus).

In Greek mythology, Erato [tpl]IPAc-en|'|Er|@|t|ou[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἐρατώ[/tpl]) is one of the Greek Muses. The name would mean "desired" or "lovely", if derived from the same root as Eros, as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica.Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, III.1-5, on-line text 
Erato is the Muse of lyric poetry, especially love and erotic poetry. In the Orphic hymn to the Muses, it is Erato who charms the sight. Since the Renaissance she is often shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses, holding a lyre, or a small kithara, a musical instrument that Apollo or she herself invented[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]. In Simon Vouet's representations, two turtle-doves are eating seeds at her feet. Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow, reminding one of the "eros", the feeling that she inspires in everybody, and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros, holding a torch.

Melpomene ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɛ|l|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|ɨ|n|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Μελπομένη[/tpl]; "to sing" or "the one that is melodious"), initially the Muse of Singing, she then became the Muse of Tragedy, for which she is best known now.[tpl]citation|last=Blyth |first=Charles |title=Virgilian Tragedy and Troilus |publisher= The Chaucer Review |date=1990. Vol. 24, no. 3, pgs. 211-218.[/tpl] Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the cothurnus, boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.
Melpomene is the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne. Her sisters include Calliope (muse of epic poetry), Clio (muse of history), Euterpe (muse of lyrical poetry), Terpsichore (muse of dancing), Erato (muse of erotic poetry), Thalia (muse of comedy), Polyhymnia (muse of hymns), and Urania (muse of astronomy).
In Roman and Greek poetry, it was traditional[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl] to invoke the goddess Melpomene so that one might create beautiful lyrical phrases (see Horace's Odes).

According to pseudo-Apollodorus, she and Apollo were the parents of the Corybantes.Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 1.3.4. Other ancient sources, however, gave the Corybantes different parents.Sir James Frazer's note on the passage in the Bibliotheca.
She was portrayed as a young woman with a joyous air, crowned with ivy, wearing boots and holding a comic mask in her hand. Many of her statues also hold a bugle and a trumpet (both used to support the actors' voices in ancient comedy), or occasionally a shepherd’s staff or a wreath of ivy.

Sparaxis (Harlequin Flower) is a genus in the family Iridaceae with about 13 species endemic to Cape Province, South Africa.
All are perennials that grow during the wet winter season, flower in spring and survive underground as dormant corms over summer.  Their conspicuous flowers have six tepals, which in most species are equal in size and shape.
Sparaxis bulbifera is the commonest in cultivation, with flowers from cream to yellow or purple. S. grandiflora is a similar but larger plant. Sparaxis tricolor has bright red flowers with yellow and black centres.  Many named hybrid cultivars were bred from S. bulbifera and S. tricolor.
A group of species with asymmetrical flowers marked in mauve and yellow, including Sparaxis variegata and Sparaxis villosa, was formerly treated as the genus Synnotia.
The genus name is derived from the Greek word sparasso, meaning "to tear", and alludes to the shape of the floral bracts.[tpl]cite book |author=Manning, John; Goldblatt, Peter |title=The Iris Family: Natural History & Classification |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon|pages=181–84 |year=2008|isbn=0-88192-897-6[/tpl]

Neustria or Neustrasia (meaning "new western land" in contrast to Austrasia) was the western part of the kingdom of the Franks[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Neustria|publisher=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Neustria|accessdate=2008-04-06[/tpl] that was created in 511 upon the division of the Merovingian kingdom of Clovis I to his four sons following his death.
Neustria was made up of the regions from Aquitaine to the English Channel, approximating most of the north of present-day France, with Paris and Soissons as its main cities. It later referred to the region between the Seine and the Loire rivers known as the regnum Neustriae, a constituent subkingdom of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia. The Carolingian kings also created a March of Neustria which was a frontier duchy against the Bretons and Vikings that lasted until the Capetian monarchy in the late 10th century, when the term was eclipsed as a European political or geographical term.
Neustria was also employed as a term for northwestern Italy during the period of Lombard domination. It was contrasted with the northeast, which was likewise called Austrasia, the same term as given to eastern Francia.

[[Speed limit]]

CATEGORIES: Road speed limit, Law enforcement, Road safety, Road traffic management, Traffic law

Road speed limits are used in most countries to set the maximum (or minimum in some cases) speed at which road vehicles may legally travel on particular stretches of road. Speed limits may be variable and in some places speeds are unlimited. Speed limits are normally indicated on a traffic sign. Speed limits are commonly set by the legislative bodies of nations or provincial governments and enforced by national or regional police and / or judicial bodies.
The first maximum speed limit was the [tpl]Convert|10|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl] limit introduced in the United Kingdom in 1861. The highest posted speed limit in the world is [tpl]Convert|140|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl], which applies to some roads in Polandhttp://www.autostrada-a4.pl/safety/traffic-rules and Bulgaria;http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=140674 similarly Texas posts [tpl]Convert|85|mph|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on one 40-mile long toll road.http://abcnews.go.com/US/speeding-texas-85-mph-highway-opens/story?id=17549839 However, some roads have no speed limit for certain classes of vehicles.  Best known are Germany's less congested Autobahns, where automobile drivers have no mandated maximum speed; measurements from the German State of Brandenburg in 2006 showed average speeds of [tpl]convert|142|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions.  Rural areas on the Isle of Man, the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh[tpl]cite web|url=http://aptransport.org/html/acts-rules/the_table_of_maximum_speed_limit_at_a_glance.pdf|title=The Table of Maximum Speed Limits at a Glance[/tpl] and Maharashtrahttp://www.mahatranscom.in/faq.aspx also lack speed limits, but speeds are lower when measured on those lower design roads.
Speed limits are usually set to attempt to cap road traffic speed; there are several reasons for wanting to do this.  It is often done with an intention to improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of road traffic casualties from traffic collisions.  In their World report on road traffic injury prevention report, the World Health Organization (WHO) identify speed control as one of various interventions likely to contribute to a reduction in road casualties.  (The WHO estimated that some 1.2 million people were killed and 50 million injured on the roads around the world in 2004.)World Heath Organisation (2004) p. foreword, "In high-income countries, an established set of interventions have contributed to signiﬁcant reductions in the incidence and impact of road traffic injuries. These include the enforcement of legislation to control speed and alcohol consumption, mandating the use of seat-belts and crash helmets, and the safer design and use of roads and vehicles."  Speed limits may also be set in an attempt to reduce the environmental impact of road traffic (vehicle noise, vibration, emissions) and to satisfy local community wishes. Some cities have reduced limits to as little as [tpl]convert|30|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] for both safety and efficiency reasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/muarc276.pdf|title=The impact of lowered speed limits in urban and metropolitan areas[/tpl]
In situations where the natural road speed is considered too high by governments, notably on urban areas where speed limits below [tpl]convert|50|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] are used then traffic calming is often also used. For some classes of vehicle, speed limiters may be mandated to enforce compliance.
Since they have been introduced, speed limits have been opposed from various sources, including motoring advocacy groups, anti-motoring groups and others who either consider them to be irrelevant, set too low or set too high.

[[Caesalpinioideae]]
CATEGORIES: Caesalpinioideae, Plant subfamilies

Caesalpinioideae is a botanical name at the rank of subfamily, placed in the large family Fabaceae or Leguminosae. Its name is formed from the generic name Caesalpinia.
The Caesalpinioideae are mainly trees distributed in the moist tropics. Their flowers are zygomorphic, but are very variable. Nodulation is rare in this subfamily, and where it does occur nodules have a primitive structure.
Because the Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae arose from within the Caesalpinioideae,[tpl]cite web | url = http://tolweb.org/Fabaceae/21093/2006.06.14 | title = Fabaceae | author = Martin F. Wojciechowski, Johanna Mahn, and Bruce Jones | year = 2006 | work = The Tree of Life Web Project [/tpl] the Caesalpinioideae is paraphyletic.  Therefore, it is likely to be split into several subfamilies, although it is not yet clear what those subfamilies should be.
In some classifications, for example the Cronquist system, the group is recognized at the rank of family, Caesalpiniaceae.
The subfamily may be classified in four tribes, Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, Cercideae and Detarieae. The tribe Cercideae has sometimes been included in the subfamily Faboideae (aka Papilionoideae) in the past.

At least one species, the peanut (Arachis hypogaea), is a major food crop species of global importance; some of the other species are cultivated for food to a small extent in South America. Other species such as A. pintoi are cultivated worldwide as forage and soil conditioner plants, with the leaves providing high-protein feed for grazing livestock and a nitrogen source in agroforestry and permaculture systems.

Eustace III, was a count of Boulogne, successor to his father Count Eustace II of Boulogne. His mother was Ida of Lorraine.
His father Eustace II appeared at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 as an ally of William the Conqueror, and is listed as a possible killer of Harold II; he is also believed to have given William his own horse after the duke's was killed under him by Gyrth, brother of Harold.
Eustace III succeeded as Count of Boulogne in 1087.[tpl]MLCC|warning=1 |title=NORTHERN FRANCE, NOBILITY |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NORTHERN%20FRANCE.htm |date=August 2012[/tpl]
In 1088, Eustace supported the rebellion against William II of England in favour of Robert Curthose.[tpl]sfn|Barlow|page=77[/tpl]
He went on the First Crusade in 1096 with his brothers Godfrey of Bouillon (duke of Lower Lotharingia) and Baldwin of Boulogne. He soon returned to Europe to administer his domains. He married Mary of Scotland, daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, and Saint Margaret of Scotland. Eustace and Mary had one daughter, Matilda of Boulogne.
When his youngest brother king Baldwin I of Jerusalem died in 1118, the elderly Eustace was offered the throne. Eustace was at first uninterested, but was convinced to accept it; he travelled all the way to Apulia before learning that a distant relative, Baldwin of Bourcq, had been crowned in the meantime. Eustace returned to Boulogne and died about 1125.
On his death the county of Boulogne was inherited by his daughter, Matilda, and her husband Stephen de Blois, count of Mortain, afterwards king of England, and at the death of Matilda in 1152 it was inherited by their son, Eustace IV of Boulogne, later their second son William and ultimately by their daughter Marie of Boulogne, since both sons died without children.

Eustace IV (c. 1129 – 17 August 1153), Count of Boulogne, was the eldest son of King Stephen of England and Countess Matilda I of Boulogne.Edmund King, Eustace, count of Boulogne, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 When his father seized the English throne on Henry I's death in 1135, he became heir apparent to the English throne.
He was first mentioned in one of his parents' charters dated no later than August 1131. In 1137, he did homage for Normandy to Louis VII of France, whose sister, Constance, he subsequently married in 1140 (as a widow she remarried to Count Raymond V of Toulouse). Eustace was knighted in 1147, at which date he was probably from sixteen to eighteen years of age. In 1151 he joined Louis in an abortive raid upon Normandy, which had accepted the title of the Empress Matilda, and was now defended by her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou.
At a council held in London on 6 April 1152, Stephen induced a small number of barons to pay homage to Eustace as their future king; but the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, and the other bishops declined to perform the coronation ceremony on the grounds that the Roman curia had declared against the claim of Eustace.
Eustace died suddenly the next year, in early August 1153, struck down (so it was said) by the wrath of God while plundering church lands near Bury St Edmunds. The death of Eustace was hailed with general satisfaction as opening the possibility of a peaceful settlement between Stephen and his rival, the young Henry of Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, King Stephen was "grieved beyond measure by the death of the son whom he hoped would succeed him; he pursued warlike preparations less vigorously, and listened more patiently than usual to the voices of those urging peace."
The Peterborough Chronicle, not content with voicing this sentiment, gives Eustace a bad character. "He was an evil man and did more harm than good wherever he went; he spoiled the lands and laid thereon heavy taxes." He had used threats against the recalcitrant bishops, and in the war against the Angevin party had demanded contributions from religious houses; these facts perhaps suffice to account for the verdict of the chronicler.
He was buried in Faversham Abbey in Kent, which was founded by his parents. They too were buried in Faversham Abbey; all three tombs are now lost, as a consequence of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Caesarea Maritima (Greek: Parálios Kaisáreia, Παράλιος Καισάρεια) is a national park on the Israeli coastline, near the town of Caesarea. The ancient Caesarea Maritima (or Caesarea Palestinae[tpl]Cite NIE|year=1905|Cæsarea Palestinæ[/tpl]) city and harbor was built by Herod the Great about 25–13 BCE. The city has been populated through the late Roman and Byzantine era. Its ruins lie on the Mediterranean coast of Israel, about halfway between the cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa, on the site of Pyrgos Stratonos ("Straton's Tower").Avner Raban and Kenneth G. Holum (1996) Caesarea Maritima: a retrospective after two millennia BRILL, ISBN 90-04-10378-3 p 54 The national park has a developed promenade with restaurants and coffee shops. The access to the Caesarea Maritima national park is via the coastal road.
Caesarea Maritima was named in honor of Augustus Caesar. The city was described in detail by the 1st-century Roman Jewish historian Josephus.Jewish Antiquities XV.331ff; The Jewish War I.408ff The city became the seat of the Roman prefect soon after its foundation. Caesarea was the "administrative capital" beginning in 6 CE.A History of the Jewish People, H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, 1976, page 247: "When Judea was converted into a Roman province 6 CE, page 246, the Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters from Jerusalem to Caesarea. This city is the location of the 1961 discovery of the Pilate Stone, the only archaeological item that mentions the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, by whose order Jesus was crucified.
The emperor Vespasian raised its status to that of a colonia. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Caesarea was the provincial capital of the Judaea Province, before the change of name to Syria Palaestina in 134 CE,  shortly before the  Bar Kokhba revolt.Shimon Applebaum (1989) Judaea in Hellenistic and Roman Times: Historical and Archaeological Essays Brill Archive, ISBN 90-04-08821-0 p 123 In Byzantine times, Caesarea remained the capital, with brief interruption of Persian and Jewish conquest between 614 and 625. In the 630s, Arab Muslim armies had taken control of the region, keeping Caesarea as its administrative center. In the early 8th century, the Umayyad caliph Suleiman transferred the seat of government of the Jund Filastin from Caesarea to Ramla.

In Greek religion and mythology, Pan ([tpl]IPAc-en|'|p|æ|n[/tpl];"Pan" (Greek mythology) entry in Collins English Dictionary, HarperCollins Publishers, 1998. [tpl]lang-grc|Πᾶν[/tpl], Pān) is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature of mountain wilds, hunting and rustic music, and companion of the nymphs.Edwin L. Brown, "The Lycidas of Theocritus Idyll 7", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 1981:59–100. His name originates within the Ancient Greek language, from the word paein (πάειν), meaning "to pasture."Edwin L. Brown, "The Divine Name 'Pan'" Transactions of the American Philological Association 107 (1977:57–61), notes (p. 59) that the first inscription mentioning Pan is a 6th-century dedication to ΠΑΟΝΙ, a "still uncontracted" form. He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. He is the god of the wild and animals. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is recognized as the god of fields, groves, and wooded glens; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring. The ancient Greeks also considered Pan to be the god of theatrical criticism.Alfred Wagner, Das historische Drama der Griechen, Münster 1878, p. 78.
In Roman religion and myth, Pan's counterpart was Faunus, a nature god who was the father of Bona Dea, sometimes identified as Fauna. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Pan became a significant figure in the Romantic movement of western Europe and also in the 20th-century Neopagan movement.The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft, Ronald Hutton, chapter 3

Chimpanzees are members of the family Hominidae, along with gorillas, humans, and orangutans. Chimpanzees split from the human branch of the family about four to six million years ago. Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives to humans, being members of the tribe Hominini (along with extinct species of subtribe Hominina). Chimpanzees are the only known members of the subtribe Panina. The two Pan species split only about one million years ago.

Toad of Toad Hall is the first of several dramatisations of Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows.  It was written by A. A. Milne, with incidental music by Harold Fraser-Simson.
Milne extracted the adventures of Mr. Toad (which form only about half of the original book) because they lent themselves most easily to being staged.  Milne loved Grahame's book, which is one of the reasons he decided to adapt it.  The play has four main characters: Rat, Badger, Mole, and Toad.  Toad's caravan and car adventures are included, as well as his imprisonment, escape, and subsequent fight with the weasels and stoats to regain his home with the help of his friends.  Although not a musical, the play contains six songs.
Its first production was at the Lyric Theatre, London on 17 December 1929.
In Season 2, Episode 2 of Downton Abbey, the Dowager Countess says to Lady Edith Crawley, "Edith! You're a lady, not Toad of Toad Hall!," after Lady Edith announces at dinner that she has volunteered to operate a tractor at a nearby farm because the men who normally operate it are away fighting in World War One.

[[Boraginaceae]]
CATEGORIES: Asterid families, Boraginaceae

The Boraginaceae, the borage or forget-me-not family, includes a variety of shrubs, trees, and herbs, totaling about 2,000 species in 146 genera found worldwide. 
Boraginaceae. Diversityoflife.com
According to the APG II, the Boraginaceae belongs among the euasterid I group, including the orders Gentianales, Lamiales, and Solanales, but whether it should be assigned to one of these orders or to its own (Boraginales) is still uncertain.  Under the older Cronquist system it was included in Lamiales, but it is now clear that it is no more similar to the other families in this order than they are to families in several other asterid orders. The Boraginaceae is paraphyletic with respect to Hydrophyllaceae and the latter is included in the former in the APG II system. In some recent classifications the Boraginaceae is broken up into several families: Boraginaceae sensu stricto, Cordiaceae, Ehretiaceae, Heliotropiaceae, Lennoaceae, and Hydrophyllaceae.
These plants have alternately arranged leaves, or a combination of alternate and opposite leaves. The leaf blades usually have a narrow shape; many are linear or lance-shaped. They are smooth-edged or toothed, and some have petioles. Most species have bisexual flowers, but some taxa are dioecious. Most pollination is by hymenopterans, such as bees. Most species have inflorescences that have a coiling shape, at least when new. The flower has a usually five-lobed calyx. The corolla varies in shape from rotate to bell-shaped to tubular, but it generally has five lobes. It can be green, white, yellow, orange, pink, purple, or blue. There are five stamens and one style with one or two stigmas. The fruit is a drupe, sometimes fleshy.Watson, L. and M. J. Dallwitz. 1992 onwards. Boraginaceae Juss. The Families of Flowering Plants. Version: 19 August 2013.
Most members of this family have hairy leaves. The coarse character of the hairs is due to cystoliths of silicon dioxide and calcium carbonate. These hairs can induce an adverse skin reaction, including itching and rash in some individuals, particularly among people who handle the plants regularly, such as gardeners.  In some species, anthocyanins cause the flowers to change color from red to blue with age. This is may be a signal to pollinators that a flower is old and depleted of pollen and nectar.Hess, D. 2005.

[[Strophe]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek theatre, Poetic form

A strophe is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the ode in Ancient Greek tragedy, followed by the antistrophe and epode. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing stanzas of varying line length. In poems composed of similar units, such as epic poems, the term strophic is synonymous with stanzaic.
In its original Greek setting, "strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of stanza framed only for the music," as John Milton wrote in the preface to Samson Agonistes, with the strophe chanted by a Greek chorus as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Epode]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek theatre, Poetic form

Epode,From [tpl]lang-el|ἐπῳδός[/tpl], epodos, "singing to/over, an enchanter." in verse, is the third part of an ode, which followed the strophe and the antistrophe, and completed the movement.
At a certain point in time the choirs, which had previously chanted to right of the altar or stage, and then to left of it, combined and sang in unison, or permitted the coryphaeus to sing for them all, while standing in the centre. With the appearance of Stesichorus and the evolution of choral lyric, a learned and artificial kind of poetry began to be cultivated in Greece, and a new form, the epode-song, came into existence. It consisted of a verse of iambic trimeter, followed by a verse of iambic dimeter, and it is reported that, although the epode was carried to its highest perfection by Stesichorus, an earlier poet, Archilochus, was really the inventor of this form.
The epode soon took a firm place in choral poetry, which it lost when that branch of literature declined. But it extended beyond the ode, and in the early dramatists we find numerous examples of monologues and dialogues framed on the epodical system. In Latin poetry the epode was cultivated, in conscious archaism, both as a part of the ode and as an independent branch of poetry. Of the former class, the epithalamia of Catullus, founded on an imitation of Pindar, present us with examples of strophe, antistrophe and epode; and it has been observed that the celebrated ode of Horace, beginning Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri, possesses this triple character.

[[Antistrophe]]

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek dances, Greek dances, Poetic form, Historical dance

Antistrophe ([tpl]lang-el|ἀντιστροφή[/tpl], "a turning back") is the portion of an ode sung by the chorus in its returning movement from west to east, in response to the strophe, which was sung from east to west.
It has the nature of a reply and balances the effect of the strophe. Thus, in Gray's ode called "The Progress of Poesy" (excerpt below), the strophe, which dwelt in triumphant accents on the beauty, power and ecstasy verse, is answered by the antistrophe, in a depressed and melancholy key:
When the sections of the chorus have ended their responses, they unite and close in the epode, thus exemplifying the triple m in which the ancient sacred hymns of Greece were coined, from the days of Stesichorus onwards. As Milton says, "strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of stanza framed for the music then used with the chorus that sang." [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
Antistrophe was also a kind of ancient dance, wherein dancers stepped sometimes to the right, and sometimes to the left, still doubling their turns or conversions. The motion toward the left, they called antistrophe, from ὰντὶ, "against", and στροφὴ, of στρέφω, "I turn".

[[Aphaea]]

Aphaea (Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Ἀφαία[/tpl], Aphaía, "without light") was a Greek goddess who was worshipped almost exclusively at a single sanctuary on the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf.  She originated as early as the 14th century BCE as a local deity associated with fertility and the agricultural cycle.Pilafidis-Williams argues that the character and relative proportions of the finds leads to the conclusion that the deity worshiped was a female fertility/agricultural goddess and dates her cult to the 14th century BCE.  The cult certainly was in operation in the 7th century BCE. Under Athenian hegemony, however, she came to be identified with the goddesses Athena and Artemis and with the nymph Britomartis as well, by the 2nd century CE, the time of Pausanias:
 
 On Aigina as one goes toward the mountain of Pan-Greek Zeus, the sanctuary of Aphaia comes up, for whom Pindar composed an ode at the behest of the Aeginetans.  The Cretans say (the myths about her are native to Crete) that Euboulos was the son of Kharmanor, who purified Apollo of the killing of the Python, and they say that Britomartis was the daughter of Zeus and Kharme (the daughter of this Euboulos). She enjoyed races and hunts and was particularly dear to Artemis. While fleeing from Minos, who lusted after her, she cast herself into nets cast for a catch of fish. Artemis made her a goddess, and not only the Cretans but also the Aeginetans revere her. The Aeginetans say that Britomartis showed herself to them on their island. Her epithet among the Aeginetans is Aphaia, and it is Diktynna of the Nets on Crete.
Description of Greece 2.30.3

The remains of the Late Archaic period Temple of Aphaea are located within a sanctuary complex on a c. 160 m peak at the northeastern end of the island: 37°45'14.82"N, 23°32'0.24"E.  The extant temple was built c. 500 BCE on the site of an earlier temple that had burned around 510 BCE.    
An inscribed potsherd of the 5th century BCE found in the precinct of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae in Arcadia is inscribed with what may be a dedication to Aphaea. If so, it would be the first known inscribed dedication to this goddess outside of Aegina.Cooper accepts the identification with Aphaea, although the inscription simply reads ΑΦΑΙ, and he draws out certain parallels between the two sanctuaries.

[[Britomartis]]

CATEGORIES: Nymphs, Greek goddesses, Hunting goddesses, Virgin goddesses, Offspring of Zeus, Minoan religion, Oreads

Britomartis (Βριτόμαρτις) was the Minoan  goddess of mountains and hunting. She is among the Minoan goddess figures that passed through the Mycenaeans' culture into classical Greek mythology, with transformations that are unclear in both transferrals.Other Minoan/Greek goddess figures that the scant archaeological evidence and speculative reading of literary sources suggest made the transition to classical Hellenic culture can be detected in aspects of the Olympian goddesses Hera, Demeter and Artemis, and in Europa, Eileithyia, Leto, Leucothea, Rhea, Pasiphaë, Ariadne, and even Helen. The subject is examined in detail in Martin P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek Religion 2nd ed. (Lund) 1950, which is presented in two sections, "The Minoan-Mycenaean religion according to the monuments" and "Minoan-Mycenaean religion in its relations to Greek religion". See also Walter Burkert, Greek Religion, 1985:10-47. For the Greeks Britomartis (Cretan dialectAccording to Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.8; the word is not Greek; Solinus says explicitly that Britomartis is the Cretan Artemis. Noted by H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (New York) 1959:117, citing Theodor Mommsen's edition, 1864. for "sweet maiden", "sweet virgin"Solinus, ix.8.) or Diktynna (derived by Hellenistic writers as from diktya, "hunting nets")For example, "...all but caught, she leapt into the sea from the top of a cliff and fell into the nets of fishermen which saved her. Whence in after days the Kydonians call the Nymphe Diktyna (Lady of the Nets) and the hill whence the Nymphe leaped they call the hill of Nets (Diktaion)," (Callimachus, Ode 3 to Artemis, 188ff. was a mountain nymph (an oread) whom Greeks recognized also in Artemis and in Aphaea, the "invisible" patroness of Aegina.K. Pilafidis-Williams, The Sanctuary of Aphaia on Aigina in the Bronze Age'' (Munich: Hirmer) 1998, describes the distinctive local cult but is cautious in retrojecting the later cult of Aphaia to describe Britomartis at Aigina; the explicit identification of Britomartis and Aphaea is in Pausanias, ii.30.3 and in Diodorus Siculus, v.76.3. 
Britomartis ("sweet maid") is an epithet that does not reveal the goddess's name,A Christian parallel may render this observation even clearer: Mater dolens, "grieving mother", identifies the Blessed Virgin, but none of the four attributes—"grieving, mother, blessed, virgin"— gives her name, Mary. nor her character, for it has the ring of an apotropaic euphemism."Her name is supposed to mean the 'Good Maiden'—which like Aristaios and Kalliste, is probably a euphemism for its opposite, the Maiden of Death." (Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, The World of Classical Myth Academic Press, 1994:113). The goddess addressed as "Britomartis" was worshipped in Crete as an aspect of Potnia, the "Mistress". The oldest aspect of the Cretan goddess was as Mother of Mountains, who appears on Minoan seals with the demonic features of a Gorgon, accompanied by the double-axes of power and gripping divine snakes. Her terror-inspiring aspect was softened by calling her Britomartis, the "good virgin", a euphemism to allay her dangerous aspect. 
Every element of the classical myths that told about Britomartis served to reduce her power and scope, even literally to entrap her in nets (but only because she "wanted" to be entrapped). The traditional patriarchal bias of Greek writers even made her the "daughter" of Zeus (see below), rather than his patroness when he was an infant in her cave on Mount Dikte, and they made her own tamed, "evolved" and cultured Olympian aspect, the huntress Artemis, responsible for granting Britomartis status as a goddess, a mythic inversion expressed by the Romanized Greek Pausanias, in the 2nd century CE: "She was made a goddess by Artemis," Pausanias asserts (2.30.3), "and she is worshipped, not only by the Cretans but also by the Aiginetans" (see Aphaea, below). But the ancient goddess never quite disappeared and remained on the coins of Cretan cities, as herself or as Diktynna, the goddess of Mount Dikte, Zeus' birthplace. As Diktynna, winged and now represented with a human face, she stood on her ancient mountain, and grasped an animal in each hand, in the guise of Potnia Theron,  the mistress of animals. The Greeks could only conceive a mistress of animals as a huntress, but on the early seals she suckles griffons. Archaic representations of winged Artemis show that she evolved from Potnia Theron.
By Hellenistic and Roman times, Britomartis was given a genealogical setting that fitted her into a Classical context:
 "Britomartis, who is also called Diktynna, the myths relate, was born at Kaino in Crete of Zeus and Karme,who was a grain-harvest sprite. the daughter of Euboulos who was the son of Demeter; she invented the nets diktya which are used in hunting."Diodorus Siculus, 5.76.3. 
The third hymn to Artemis by Callimachus tells how she was pursued by Minos and, as Diktynna, "Lady of the Nets", threw herself into fishermen's nets to escape him; thus rescued, she was taken by the fishermen to mainland Greece. She was also known as Dicte.  This myth element "explains" the spread of the Cretan goddess's cult to Greece. Didorus Siculus found it less than credible: "But those men who tell the tale that she has been named Diktynna because she fled into some fishermen’s nets when she was pursued by Minos, who would have ravished her, have missed the truth; for it is not a probable story that the goddess should ever have got into so helpless a state that she would have required the aid that men can give, being as she is the daughter of the greatest one of the gods."Diodorus Siculus 5.76.3. Strabo notes she was venerated as Diktynna only in western Crete, in the region of Cydonia, where there was a Diktynnaion , or temple of Diktynna.  "Oupis Artemis, O queen, fairfaced Bringer of Light, thee too the Kretans name after that Nymph," Callimachus says.  "She passed her time in the company of Artemis, this being the reason why some men think Diktynna and Artemis are one and the same goddess," Diodorus Siculus (5.76.3) suggested.    
In Minoan art, and on coins, seals and rings and the like throughout Greece, Britomartis is depicted with demonic features, carrying a double-handed axe and accompanied by feral animals.

[[Fruit tree forms]]
CATEGORIES: Trees, Fruit, Horticultural techniques, Agronomy

Fruit trees are grown in a variety of shapes, sometimes to please the eye but mainly to encourage fruit production. The form or shape of fruit trees can be manipulated by pruning and training. Shaping and promoting a particular tree form is done to establish the plant in a particular situation under certain environmental conditions, to increase fruit yield, and to enhance fruit quality. For example, pruning a tree to a pyramid shape enables trees to be planted closer together.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] An open bowl or cup form helps sunlight penetrate the canopy, thus encouraging a high fruit yield whilst keeping the tree short and accessible for harvesting.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] Other shapes such as cordons, espaliers and fans offer opportunities for growing trees two dimensionally against walls or fences, or they can be trained to function as barriers.

[[Hemoglobinopathy]]

CATEGORIES: Hereditary hemolytic anemias, Disorders of globin and globulin proteins

Hemoglobinopathy is a kind of genetic defect that results in abnormal structure of one of the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule.[tpl]DorlandsDict|four/000048231|hemoglobinopathy[/tpl] Hemoglobinopathies are inherited single-gene disorders; in most cases, they are inherited as autosomal co-dominant traits.Weatherall DJ, Clegg JB. Inherited haemoglobin disorders: an increasing global health problem. Bull World Health Organ. 2001;79(8):704-712. Common hemoglobinopathies include sickle-cell disease. It is estimated that 7% of world's population (420 million) are carriers, with 60% of total and 70% pathological being in Africa. Hemoglobinopathies are most common in ethnic populations from Africa, the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia.
Hemoglobinopathies imply structural abnormalities in the globin proteins themselves.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemoglobinopathy/ |title=Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemia |website=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/ [/tpl] Thalassemias, in contrast, usually result in underproduction of normal globin proteins, often through mutations in regulatory genes. The two conditions may overlap, however, since some conditions which cause abnormalities in globin proteins (hemoglobinopathy) also affect their production (thalassemia). Thus, some hemoglobinopathies are also thalassemias, but most are not.
Either hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia, or both, may cause anemia. Some well-known hemoglobin variants such as sickle-cell anemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia are responsible for diseases, and are considered hemoglobinopathies. However, many hemoglobin variants do not cause pathology or anemia, and thus are often not classed as hemoglobinopathies, because they are not considered pathologies. Hemoglobin variants are a part of the normal embryonic and fetal development, but may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a population, caused by variations in genetics. Other variants cause no detectable pathology, and are thus considered non-pathological variants.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/hemoglobin_var/glance-3.html | title = Hemoglobin Variants | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2007-11-10 | work = Lab Tests Online | publisher = American Association for Clinical Chemistry | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-10-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://globin.cse.psu.edu/html/huisman/variants/ | title = A Syllabus of Human Hemoglobin Variants | author = Huisman THJ | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | format = | work = Globin Gene Server | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-10-12[/tpl]

There are two tombs called "Tomb of Tantalus" near the summits of the neighboring mountains of Yamanlar and Mount Sipylus in western Turkey, sources by respective scholars differing on the associations that may be based on the one or the other. Her father is referred to as "Phrygian" and sometimes even as "King of Phrygia",[tpl]cite book|title= Bulfinch's Mythology  |isbn=1440426309|year= 2010|author=Thomas Bulfinch|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform [/tpl] although his city was located in the western extremity of Anatolia where Lydia was to emerge as a state before the beginning of the first millennium B.C.E, and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia, situated more inland. References to his son and Niobe's brother as "Pelops the Lydian" led some scholars to the conclusion that there would be good grounds for believing that she belonged to a primordial house of Lydia.
She was already mentioned in Homer's Iliad which relates her proud hubris, for which she was punished by Leto, who sent Apollo and Artemis, with the loss of all her children, and her nine days of abstention from food during which time her children lay unburied.Iliad 24.603–610. Once the gods interred them, she retreated to her native Sipylus, "where Nymphs dance around the River Acheloos,The river Acheloos in Niobe's story should not confused with its much larger namesake, the Achelous River in mainland Greece. Acheloos mentioned by Homer could correspond to the modern-day Çaybaşı Stream which flows around the slopes of the Mount Sipylus in immediate proximity of The Weeping Rock associated with her. It is worth noting that the plain between the coast and the ancient city of Adramyttium was also called "Thebe" (the present-day Edremit Plain). and although being a stone, she broods over the sorrows sent from the Gods".Iliad xxiv.602ff Later writersPs-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke, iii.5.6, iii. asserted that Niobe was wedded to Amphion, one of the twin founders of Thebes, where there was a single sanctuary where the twin founders were venerated, but in fact no shrine to Niobe.

Pixar Animation Studios, or simply Pixar ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|s|ɑr[/tpl], stylized as PIXAR), is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. The studio is best known for its CGI-animated feature films created with PhotoRealistic RenderMan, its own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface used to generate high-quality images. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the computer division of Lucasfilm before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986 with funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority shareholder. The Walt Disney Company bought Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion, a transaction which made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder. On December 21, 2012, Pixar Animation Studios became the Lucasfilm's partner company since The Adventures of André and Wally B.. Luxo Jr., a character from an early Pixar film, is the mascot of the studio.
Pixar has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story (1995), and its most recent being Monsters University (2013).

[[Itylus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, Itylus, or Itylos, was the son of Aedon,  daughter of Pandareus of Ephesus and wife of King Zethus of Thebes. Envious of Niobe, the wife of her husband's brother Amphion, who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child. The mythic theme was an ancient one, for Homer's listeners were expected to know the allusion, when Penelope reveals to the still- disguised Odysseus her anguish of a night:
 "I lie on my bed, and the sharp anxieties swarming 
 thick and fast on my beating heart torment my sorrowing self. 
As when Pandareos' daughter, the greenwood nightingale 
perching in the deep of the forest foliage sings out 
her lovely sing when springtime is just begun, she varying 
the mainfold strains of her voice, pours out the melody 
mourning Itylos, son of the lord Zethos, her own beloved 
child, whom she once killed with the bronze, when the madness was upon her; 
So my mind is divided, and starts one way, then another" (Odyssey xix.519-24; Richard Lattimore's translation).
 
As one of only nine similes in the Odyssey that are longer than five lines, the thematic complexity of the image and its multiple points of contact with Penelope's situation has arrested the attention of many readers.Emily Katz Anhalt, "A Matter of Perspective: Penelope and the Nightingale in 'Odyssey' 19.512-534", The Classical Journal 97.2 (December 2001), pp 145-159.
Aedon accidentally killed Itylus "in her madness" and was stricken with grief and guilt.  In pity, the gods turned her into a nightingale, which cries with sadness every night.  In an explanatory scholium on this passage, an anonymous scholiast, echoed by Eustathius, explains that Aedon attempted to kill the son of her sister-in-law and rival, Niobe, but accidentally killed her own son instead: thus, the gods changed her into a nightingale to weep for eternity. The setting of the episode is Thebes.
Attic authors later than Homer, including the dramatists knew a nightingale myth in which Procne was married to Tereus, who betrayed her by violating her sister Philomela, whose tongue he cut out so that she could not tell. (In some versions[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl], Philomela is the name of the wife, Procne of her mutilated sister.) Philomela wove her story into a robe that she gave to Procne. In a fit of madness Procne murdered her own child by Tereus, Itys.Itys is simply a doublet of Itylus. All were changed to birds, the murderous mother to a nightingale.The most substantial surviving account of this myth is in the repertory of myth,  Bibliotheke, but many Greek authors allude to Procne.

In Greek mythology, the satyr  Marsyas  ([tpl]lang-grc|Μαρσύας[/tpl]) is a central figure in two stories involving death: in one, he picked up the double flute (aulos) that had been abandoned by Athena and played it;The folk of Celaenae held "that the Song of the Mother, an air for the flute, was composed by Marsyas", according to Pausanias (x.30.9). in the other, he challenged Apollo to a contest of music and lost his hide and life. In Antiquity, literary sources often emphasise the hubris'' of Marsyas and the justice of his punishment.
In one conjunction Rhea/Cybele, and his episodes are situated by the mythographers in Celaenae (or Kelainai) in Phrygia (today, the town of Dinar in Turkey), at the main source of the Meander (the river Menderes).The river is linked to the figure of Marsyas by Herodotus (Histories, 7.26) and Xenophon (Anabasis, 1.2.8).
When a genealogy was applied to him, Marsyas was the son of Olympus (son of Heracles and Euboea, daughter of Thespius), or of Oeagrus, or of Hyagnis.Hyagnis (Greek: Ὑάγνις, gen.: Ὑάγνιδος, or Ἄγνις) was a mythical musician from Phrygia who was considered to be the inventor of the aulos. Hyagnis was also one of the three mythical Phrygian musicians (along with Marsyas and Olympus) to whom the Ancient Greeks attributed the invention of the Phrygian mode in music(see Anthi Dipla:2001). Olympus was, alternatively, said to be Marsyas' son or pupil.

[[Niobids]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology

In Greek mythology, the Niobids were the children of Amphion of Thebes and Niobe, slain by Apollo and Artemis because Niobe, born of the royal house of Phrygia, had boastfully compared the greater number of her own offspring with those of Leto, Apollo's and Artemis' mother: a classic example of hubris.Robert Graves, The Greek Myths, 1960, §77.
The number of Niobids mentioned most usually numbered twelve (Homer) or fourteen (Euripides and pseudo-Apollodorus), but other sources mention twenty,A number attributed to Hesiod by various scholiasts (Graves 1960:259. four (Herodotus), or eighteen (Sappho). Generally half these children were sons, the other half daughters. The names of some of the children are mentioned; these lists vary by author:
Other different names were also mentioned, including Amyclas and Meliboea (also in Apollodorus, see below).
Manto, the seeress daughter of Tiresias, overheard Niobe's remark and bid the Theban women placate Leto, in vain. Apollo and Artemis slew all the children of Niobe with their arrows, Apollo shooting the sons, Artemis the daughters. According to some sources, however, two of the Niobids who had supplicated Leto were spared: Apollodorus gives their names as Meliboea (Chloris)Meliboëa had turned so pale with fear that she was still nicknamed Chloris when she married Neleus some years later." (Graves 1960:259). and Amyclas. Another apparent survivor is Phylomache, who is mentioned by Apollodorus as one of the two possible spouses of Pelias.Bibliotheca 1. 9. 10
The Niobids were buried by the gods at Thebes. Ovid remarked that all men mourned Amphion, for the extinction of his line, but none mourned Niobe save her brother Pelops.Ovid. Metamorphoses, VI.401-04.

[[Cyparissus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Metamorphoses in Greek mythology, Pederastic heroes and deities

In Greek mythology, Cyparissus or Kyparissos (Greek: Κυπάρισσος, "cypress") was a boy beloved by Apollo, or in some versions by other deities. In the best-known version of the story, the favorite companion of Cyparissus was a tamed stag, which he accidentally killed with his hunting javelin as it lay sleeping in the woods. The boy's grief was such that it transformed him into a cypress tree, a classical symbol of mourning. The myth is thus aetiological in explaining the relation of the tree to its cultural significance.
Cyparissus was the son of Telephus, and his story is set in Chios. The subject is mainly known from Hellenized Latin literature and frescoes from Pompeii.Cedric G. Boulter and Julie L. Bentz, "Fifth-Century Attic Red Figure at Corinth," Hesperia 49.4 (October 1980), pp. 295-308. The authors present a possible identification of Cyparissus on a fragment of a Corinthian pot, No. 36, p. 306. The frescoes in the Pompeiian Fourth Style are discussed by Andreas Rumpf, "Kyparissos", Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts 63/64 (1948-49), pp 83-90. No Greek hero cult devoted to Cyparissus has been identified.

In Greek mythology, Telephus or Telephos ([tpl]lang-grc|Τήλεφος[/tpl], "far-shining")See for example, Knight, p. 433. According to the mythographic tradition, Telephus' name derived from his being suckled by a doe, e.g. Apollodorus, Library 2.7.4 (Frazer note 2 to AP 2.7.4: 'Apollodorus seems to derive the name Telephus from θηλή, “a dug,” and ἔλαφος, “a doe."'). See also Huys p.295 ff.; Webster pp 238–239;  Hyginus, Fabulae 99; Diodorus Siculus, 4.33.11; Moses of Chorene, Progymnasm 3.3: "He got his name from circumstances". According to Kerenyi his name was "more accurately ... Telephanes, 'he who shines afar'" (Kerenyi, p. 337). The feminine form is Telephassa, of whom Karl Kerenyi writes, "She bore the lunar name Telephassa or Telephae, 'she who illuminates afar', or Argiope 'she of the white face'". (Kerenyi, p.  27).  was the son of Heracles and Auge, daughter of king Aleus of Tegea; and the father of Eurypylus. He was intended to be king of Tegea, but instead became the king of Mysia in Asia Minor. He was wounded by the Achaeans when they were coming to sack Troy and bring back Helen to Sparta.

Eros shot Apollo with one of his arrows, causing him to fall in love with Daphne. It was Eros's plan that Daphne would scorn Apollo because Eros was angry that Apollo had made fun of his archery skills. Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo's singing. Daphne prayed to the river god Peneus to help her. He changed her into a laurel tree, which later became sacred to Apollo - see Apollo and Daphne.

Daphne ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|f|n|iː[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|Δάφνη[/tpl], meaning "laurel") is a minor figure in Greek mythology known as a Naiad—a type of female nymph associated with fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of freshwater.  There are several versions of the myth, but the general narrative is that because of her beauty, Daphne attracted the attention and ardor of the god Apollo (Phoebus).  Apollo pursued her and just before being overtaken, Daphne pleaded to her father, the rivergod Ladon and Ge.Pausanias. Description of Greece. 8.20.§1-2.  for help. So he then transformed Daphne into a laurel tree.  In Metamorphoses by Roman poet Ovid, she is identified as the daughter of the rivergod Pineios in Thessaly.Ovid. Metamorphoses. I:452 At the Pythian Games which were held every four years in Delphi in honour of Apollo, a wreath of laurel gathered from the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly was given as a prize.

[[Cyrene (mythology)]]

In Greek mythology, as recorded in Pindar's 9th Pythian ode, Cyrene [tpl]IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|r|iː|n|iː[/tpl] or Kyrene ([tpl]lang-grc|Κυρήνη[/tpl], "sovereign queen") was the daughter of Hypseus, King of the Lapiths, although some myths state that her father was actually the river-god Peneus and she was a nymph rather than mortal.Hyginus Fabulae 161, Virgil Georgics 4.320 
Cyrene was a fierce huntress, called by Nonnus a "deer-chasing second Artemis, the girl lionkiller."Nonnus, Dionysiaca 13. 300 ff Pindar describes her in his Pythian Ode: 
When a lion attacked her father's sheep, Cyrene wrestled with the lion. Apollo, who was present, immediately fell in love with her and kidnapped her. He took her to North Africa and founded the city of Cyrene in her name. The region, Cyrenaica, is also named for her. Together, she and Apollo had two sons: Aristaeus, the demigod who invented beekeeping, and Idmon, the Argonaut seer.http://www.mythindex.com/greek-mythology/C/Cyrene.html Greek Myth Index: Cyrene Other stories say that Cyrene was not wrestling with a lion but instead tending her sheep along the marsh-meadow of the river Pineios, and that Apollo later transformed her into a nymph to grant her a longer life.http://www.maicar.com/GML/Cyrene.html Greek Mythology Link
Cyrene is also mentioned in the second and third hymns of Callimachus as well as in The Poet and the Women (written by Aristophanes) whence Mnesilochus comments that he "can't see a man there at all-only Cyrene" when setting eyes upon the poet Agathon who emerges from his house to greet Euripides and himself dressed in women's clothing.
With Ares, Cyrene (if indeed this is the same Cyrene) was the mother of Diomedes of Thrace.

[[Aristaeus]]

CATEGORIES: Greek gods, Beekeeping, Animal gods, Greek mythological hero cult, Religion in ancient Boeotia, Offspring of Apollo

A minor god in Greek mythology, which we read largely through Athenian writers, Aristaeus [tpl]IPAc-en|ær|ɨ|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə|s[/tpl] or Aristaios ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀρισταῖος[/tpl]), "ever close follower of the flocks", was the culture hero credited with the discovery of many useful arts, including bee-keeping;His inventions of apicultural apparatus, such as the linen gauze bee-keeper's mask and the technique of smoking the hive, were elaborated by Nonnus in his Dionysiaca, V.214ff. he was the son of Apollo and the huntress Cyrene. Aristeus ("the best") was a cult title in many places: Boeotia, Arcadia, Ceos, Sicily, Sardinia, Thessaly, and Macedonia; consequently a set of "travels" was imposed, connecting his epiphanies in order to account for these widespread manifestations.Compare the "travels" of Hercules in the Western Mediterranean.
If Aristaeus was a minor figure at Athens, he was more prominent in Boeotia, where he was "the pastoral Apollo"An expression credited to Hesiod in Servius' commentary on Virgil's Georgics, I.14; cf. William J. Slater, Lexicon to Pindar (Berlin: de Gruyter) 1969, s.v. ""Nomios". When "pastoral Apollo" appears in lines of Theocritus (Idyll XXV) and Callimachus (Ode to Apollo, 47) the expression blurs the effective domaines of the two figures. and was linked to the founding myth of Thebes by marriage with Autonoë, daughter of Cadmus, the founder.Hesiod, Theogony 977. Aristaeus may appear as a winged youth in painted Boeotian pottery,As on a Boeotian tripod-kothon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, illustrated and discussed in Brian F. Cook, "Aristaios" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin New Series, 21.1 (Summer 1962), pp. 31-36; there Aristaeus hastens with a mattock and a one-handled amphora, which Cook interprets as filled with seed-corn. similar to representations of the Boreads, spirits of the North Wind.
According to Pindar's ninth Pythian Ode and Apollonius' Argonautica (II.522ff),  Cyrene despised spinning and other womanly arts and instead spent her days hunting, but, in a prophecy he put in the mouth of the wise centaur Chiron, Apollo would spirit her to Libya and make her the foundress of a great city, Cyrene, in a fertile coastal plain.Thus Pindar set into a mythological past a prophecy of the comparatively recent founding of Cyrene (630 BCE). When Aristaeus was born, according to what Pindar sang, Hermes took him to be raised on nectar and ambrosia and be made immortal by Gaia. The Myrtle-nymphs taught him useful arts and mysteries, how to curdle milk for cheese, how to tame the Goddess's bees and keep them in hives, and how to tame the wild oleaster and make it bear olives. Thus he became the patron god of cattle, fruit trees, hunting, husbandry and bee-keeping. He also taught humanity dairy skills (including cheesemaking) and the use of nets and traps in hunting.
When he was grown, he sailed from Libya to Boeotia, where he was inducted into further mysteries in the cave of Chiron the centaur. In Boeotia, he was married to Autonoë and became the father of the ill-fated Actaeon, who inherited the family passion for hunting, to his ruin, and of Macris, who nursed the child Dionysus.

In Greek mythology, Polyxena ([tpl]IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|k|s|ɨ|n|ə[/tpl]; Greek: [tpl]lang|grc|Πολυξένη[/tpl]) was the youngest daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen, Hecuba.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Duckworth |first=George E |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Polyxena |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |page=231 [/tpl] She is considered the Trojan version of Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Polyxena is not in Homer's Iliad, appearing in works by later poets, perhaps to add romance to Homer's austere tale. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated if Polyxena's brother, Prince Troilus, reached the age of twenty. During the Trojan War, Polyxena and Troilus were ambushed when they were attempting to fetch water from a fountain, and Troilus was killed by the Greek warrior Achilles, who soon became interested in the quiet sagacity of Polyxena.
Achilles, still recovering from Patroclus' death, found Polyxena's words a comfort and was later told to go to the temple of Apollo to meet her after her devotions. Achilles seemed to trust Polyxena—he told her of his only vulnerability: his vulnerable heel. It was later in the temple of Apollo that Polyxena's brothers, Paris and Deiphobus, ambushed Achilles and shot him in the heel with an arrow, supposedly guided by the hand of Apollo himself, steeped in poison.
Some claimed Polyxena committed suicide after Achilles' death out of guilt. According to Euripides, however, in his plays The Trojan Women and Hecuba, Polyxena's famous death was caused at the end of the Trojan War. Achilles' ghost had come back to the Greeks, demanding that the wind needed to set sail back to Hellas was to be appeased by the human sacrifice of Polyxena. She was to be killed at the foot of Achilles' grave. Hecuba, Polyxena's mother, expressed despair at the death of another of her daughters. (Polyxena was killed after almost all of her brothers and sisters.)
However, Polyxena was eager to die as a sacrifice to Achilles rather than die as a slave. She reassured her mother, and refused to beg before Odysseus or be treated in any way other than a princess. She asked that Odysseus reassure her mother as she is led away. Polyxena's virginity was critical to the honor of her character, and she was described as dying bravely as the son of Achilles, Neoptolemus, slit her throat: she arranged her clothing around her carefully so that she was fully covered when she died.

Phlegyas ([tpl]lang-el|Φλεγύας[/tpl]), son of Ares and Chryse or Dotis, was king of the Lapiths in Greek mythology. He was the father of Ixion and Coronis, one of Apollo's lovers. While pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus. When a crow informed Apollo of the affair, he sent his sister Artemis to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby though and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise. Phlegyas was irate and torched the Apollonian temple at Delphi, causing Apollo to kill him. 
In the Aeneid of Virgil, Phlegyas is shown tormented in the Underworld, warning others not to despise the Gods. In the Thebaid of Statius, Phlegyas is entombed in a rock by Megaera (one of the Furies) and starves in front of an eternal feast.
In the Divine Comedy poem Inferno, Phlegyas ferries Virgil and Dante across the river Styx, which is portrayed as a marsh where the wrathful and sullen lie. Phlegyas was the mythical ancestor of the Phlegyans.

Of the three Gorgons, she was known to be the most independent and ferocious, having killed more men than both of her sisters combined. In Greek mythology, she was transformed into a Gorgon because of standing with her sister Medusa, who was either raped or seduced by the sea god Poseidon in the Temple of Athena. Athena was furious with Medusa. As a punishment, Medusa was changed into a terrible monster, along with her sisters Stheno and Euryale.

[[Chrysaor]]

CATEGORIES: Hellenistic Caria, Kings in Greek mythology, Offspring of Poseidon

In Greek mythology, Chrysaor ([tpl]lang-el|Χρυσάωρ, Khrusaōr[/tpl]; English translation: "He who has a golden armament"), the brother of the winged horse Pegasus, was often depicted as a young man, the son of Poseidon and Medusa. Chrysaor and Pegasus were not born until Perseus chopped off Medusa's head.Hesiod, Theogony 280.
Medusa, one of the three Gorgon sisters, the most beautiful, and the only mortal one, angered Athena by having sex with Poseidon in the Temple of Athena. As punishment, Athena turned her hair into snakes. Some versions of the story state that Athena also cursed her so that a pair of golden wings grew from her head. Chrysaor and Pegasus were said to be born from the drops of Medusa's blood which fell in the sea; others say that they sprang from Medusa's neck as Perseus beheaded her, a "higher" birth (such as the birth of Athena from the head of Zeus). Chrysaor is said to have been king of Iberia. He is also featured in the 2012 novel The Heroes Of Olympus: The Mark Of Athena written by Rick Riordan and is said to wield a golden sword.
 Chrysaor, married to Callirrhoe, daughter of glorious Oceanus, was father to the triple-headed Geryon, but Geryon was killed by the great strength of Heracles at sea-circled Erytheis beside his own shambling cattle on that day when Heracles drove those broad-faced cattle toward holy Tiryns, when he crossed the stream of Okeanos and had killed Orthos and the oxherd Eurytion out in the gloomy meadow beyond fabulous Oceanos. 
 In art Chrysaor's earliest appearance seems to be on the great pediment of the early 6th century BC Doric Temple of Artemis at Corfu, where he is shown beside his mother, Medusa.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]

[[Asia (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Oceanids, Greek goddesses, Asia in Greek mythology, Lydia, Herodotus

Asia in Greek mythology was a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, the wife of the Titan Iapetus, and mother of Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius. Hesiod gives the name of another Oceanid, Clymene, in his Theogony (359) but the Bibliotheca (1.8) gives instead the name Asia as does Lycophron (1411). It is possible that the name Asia became preferred over Hesiod's Clymene to avoid confusion with the Clymene who was mother of Phaethon by Helios in some accounts and must have been perceived as a distinct figure. Herodotus (4.45.1) records the tradition that the continent Asia was named after Asia whom he calls wife of Prometheus rather than mother of Prometheus, perhaps here a simple error rather than genuine variant tradition. Both Acusilaus and Aeschylus in his Prometheus Bound call Prometheus' wife Hesione.
Herodotus relates also the Lydian tradition:Histories (Herodotus)  4.45.1 "yet the Lydians claim a share in the latter name, saying that Asia was not named after Prometheus' wife Asia, but after Asies, the son of Cotys, who was the son of Manes, and that from him the Asiad clan at Sardis also takes its name".

[[Astraea (mythology)]]
CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Greek goddesses, Justice goddesses, Offspring of Zeus, Virgin goddesses

In Greek mythology, Astraea or Astrea ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀστραῖα[/tpl];Astraea - Zeno.org (German) English translation: "star-maiden") was a daughter of Zeus and Themis or of Astraeus and Eos. She and her mother were both personifications of justice, though Astraea was also associated with innocence and purity. She is always associated with the Greek goddess of justice, Dike (confused with Asteria, the goddess of the stars and the daughter of Coeus and Phoebe).
Astraea, the celestial virgin, was the last of the immortals to live with humans during the Golden Age, one of the old Greek religion's five deteriorating Ages of Man.Aratus, Phaenomena 97–128. According to Ovid, Astraea abandoned the earth during the Iron Age.Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.149–50, trans. in [tpl]cite book |title=The Metamorphosis |last=Ovid |first= |authorlink=Ovid |others=Frank Justus Miller (trans) |year=AD 8 (trans 1916) |publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59308-276-5 |at=p. 6 Book I |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]  Fleeing from the new wickedness of humanity, she ascended to heaven to become the constellation Virgo  the nearby constellation Libra ,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] reflected in her symbolic association with Justitia in Latin culture. In the Tarot, the 8th card, Justice, with a figure of Justitia, can thus be considered related to the figure of Astraea on historical iconographic grounds.
According to legend, Astraea will one day come back to Earth, bringing with her the return of the utopian Golden Age of which she was the ambassador.

CATEGORIES: Greek goddesses, Personification in Greek mythology, Titans, Offspring of Gaia, Divine women of Zeus, Justice goddesses

Themis (Greek: Θέμις) is an ancient Greek Titaness. She is described as "of good counsel", and is the personification of divine order, law, natural law and custom. Themis means "divine law" rather than human ordinance, literally "that which is put in place", compared with títhēmi (Greek: τίθημι), meaning "to put".
To the ancient Greeks she was originally the organizer of the "communal affairs of humans, particularly assemblies".(University of Washington School of Law) Themis, Goddess of Justice  Moses Finley remarked of themis, as the word was used by Homer in the 8th century, to evoke the social order of the 10th- and 9th-century Greek Dark Ages:
 Themis is untranslatable. A gift of the gods and a mark of civilized existence, sometimes it means right custom, proper procedure, social order, and sometimes merely the will of the gods (as revealed by an omen, for example) with little of the idea of right.Finley, The World of Odysseus, rev. ed.(New York: Viking Prewss) 1978: 78, note. 
Finley adds, "There was themis—custom, tradition, folk-ways, mores, whatever we may call it, the enormous power of 'it is (or is not) done'. The world of Odysseus had a highly developed sense of what was fitting and proper."Finley, op. cit. p. 82.

Glastonbury Festival (originally Pilton Pop, Blues & Folk Festival; current formal title Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts) is a five day music festival that takes place near Pilton, Somerset, England. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts. It is organised by Michael Eavis on his own land, Worthy Farm in Pilton. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people http://www.cnbc.com/id/42150834/page/6 requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes.
The first festival was in 1970; influenced by hippie ethics and the free festival movement the festival retains vestiges of this tradition such as the Green Fields area which includes the Green Futures and Healing Field. After the 1970s the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, with the number of attendees sometimes being swollen by gate-crashers. Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music; fourteen people invested everything they had to build the stage.

[[Atë]]
CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Greek goddesses, Ancient Greece, Offspring of Zeus

Atë, Até or Aite ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|t|iː[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɑː|t|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|ἄτη[/tpl]) is the Greek goddess of mischief, delusion, ruin, and folly. Até also refers to the action performed by the hero, usually because of hubris, that often leads to his or her death or downfall. Her parent was either Zeus or Eris.[tpl]cite web|last=Atsma|first=Aaron J|title=Ate|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Ate.html|work=Thei Greek Mythology|accessdate=10 March 2012[/tpl]
In Homer's Iliad (Book 19) she is called eldest daughter of Zeus with no mother mentioned. On Hera's instigation she used her influence over Zeus so that he swore an oath that on that day a mortal descended from him would be born who would be a great ruler. Hera immediately arranged to delay the birth of Heracles and to bring forth Eurystheus prematurely. In anger Zeus threw Atë down to earth forever, forbidding that she ever return to heaven or to Mt. Olympus.  Atë then wandered about, treading on the heads of men rather than on the earth, wreaking havoc on mortals.
The Litae ("Prayers") follow after her but Atë is fast and far outruns them.
The Bibliotheca (3.143) claims that when thrown down by Zeus, Atë landed on a peak in Phrygia called by her name. There Ilus later, following a cow, founded the city of Ilion, known as Troy. This flourish is chronologically at odds with Homer's dating of Atë's fall.
In Hesiod's Theogony (l. 230) the mother of Atë is Eris ("Strife"), with no father mentioned.
In Nonnus' Dionysiaca (11.113), at Hera's instigation Atë persuades the boy Ampelus whom Dionysus passionately loves, to impress Dionysus by riding on a bull from which Ampelus subsequently falls and breaks his neck.
In the play Julius Caesar, Shakespeare introduces the goddess Atë as an invocation of vengeance and menace. Mark Antony, lamenting Caesar's murder, envisions:

Shakespeare also mentions her in the play Much Ado About Nothing, when Benedick says, referring to Beatrice,

In her book The March of Folly, Barbara Tuchman notes that the earth has been called The Meadow of Atë.Tuchman, B., The March of Folly, p. 47, Alfred A. Knopf, 1984
In Spencer's The Faerie Queene, a fiend from Hell disguised as a beautiful woman is called Ate. This is a possible parallel to the fallen angels.

[[Litae]]

CATEGORIES: Personification in Greek mythology, Greek goddesses, Offspring of Zeus

Litae ([tpl]lang-el|Λιταί[/tpl] meaning 'Prayers') are personifications in Greek mythology.
They appear in Homer's Iliad in Book 9 as the lame and wrinkled daughters of Zeus (no mother named and no number given) who follow after Zeus' exiled daughter Até ('Folly') as healers but who cannot keep up with the fast-running Até. They bring great advantage to those who venerate them; but if someone dishonors them, then they go to Zeus and ask that Até be sent against that person.Homer, Iliad, 9. 502 ff; see also Quintus Smyrnaeus, Fall of Troy, 10. 302
This is an obvious allegory on the supposed power of prayer to mitigate the misfortunes into which one's folly has led one.

Delos had a position as a holy sanctuary for a millennium before Olympian Greek mythology made it the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. From its Sacred Harbour, the horizon shows the two conical mounds (image below) that have identified landscapes sacred to a goddess in other sites: one, retaining its pre-Greek name Mount Kynthos,The combination -nth- is a marker for pre-Greek words: Corinth, menthos, labyrinth, etc. A name Artemis and even Diana retained was Cynthia. is crowned with a sanctuary of Zeus.

This Titanomachia is also known as the Battle of the Titans, Battle of Gods, or just The Titan War. The war was fought to decide who would become the rulers of the Universe.
Greeks of the Classical age knew of several poems about the war between the gods and many of the Titans.  The dominant one, and the only one that has survived, is the Theogony attributed to Hesiod. A lost epic, Titanomachia, attributed to the blind Thracian bard Thamyris, himself a legendary figure, was mentioned in passing in an essay On Music that was once attributed to Plutarch. The Titans also played a prominent role in the poems attributed to Orpheus. Although only scraps of the Orphic narratives survive, they show interesting differences from the Hesiodic tradition.

Cyclops is a fictional character, a superhero that appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. He often serves as the field leader of the X-Men. A mutant, Cyclops emits a powerful energy beam from his eyes (an "optic blast").  In uniform, he wears a battle visor with a single, ruby-quartz lens running eye-to-eye; the resulting one-eyed appearance is why he is codenamed "Cyclops", after the one-eyed giants of Greek mythology.
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963).  Originally dubbed Slim Summers, by X-Men #3 his name was changed to Scott—Slim became just a nickname.  Scott is the first of the X-Men recruited by Professor X; Xavier hand-picks Scott to lead his X-Men, and to carry on the legacy of his mutant-human-harmony ideals.  Xavier views Scott as one of his most prized pupils; their relationship exhibits father/son qualities. From time to time, Scott's extreme loyalty to Xavier has cost him dearly in his relationships with others; but, over the course of the characters' publication history, he eventually emerges from Xavier's shadow as the X-Men's undisputed leader.
Cyclops is most often portrayed as the archetypal hero of traditional American popular culture—the opposite of the tough, anti-authority, antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War (e.g., Wolverine, his X-Men teammate).[tpl]Cite book| last=Wright | first=Bradford W. | title=Comic Book Nation | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | date=September 18, 2003 | page=265 | isbn=978-0-8018-7450-5[/tpl] Selfless, self-disciplined, and ethical, Cyclops also possesses tremendous leadership abilities, and great tactical and strategic skills.
He is the son of Corsair (Major Christopher Summers) of the Starjammers; the oldest brother of both Havok (Alex Summers) and Vulcan (Gabriel Summers); the father of Cable (Nathan Summers); and, the widower of Madelyne Pryor and Jean Grey.  He is also a long-time friend of Beast (Hank McCoy). In alternate realities, he has also been the father of Rachel Summers and Ruby Summers, and a biological parent of X-Man and Stryfe.
James Marsden has portrayed Cyclops in the first three X-Men films, while in the 2009 prequel film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he is portrayed as a teenager by actor Tim Pocock. In 2006, IGN.com rated Cyclops #1 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years.The Top 25 X-Men Wizard Magazine also ranked Cyclops the 106th Best Comic Book Character of All Time.http://www.wizarduniverse.com/0517085thgreatestcharacters2.html In 2011, IGN ranked Cyclops 39th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes and readers of Comic Book Resources voted him the 9th Top Marvel Character of All Time.http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/22/2011-top-marvel-characters-9-8/
