[[Musha'sha'iyyah]]

CATEGORIES: History of Iran, History of Islam, Shia Islamic sects, Iranian Arab people

The Musha‘sha’iyyah ([tpl]lang-ar|المشعشعية[/tpl]) were a Shī‘ah sect founded and led by Muhammad ibn Falah, an Iraqi-born theologian who believed himself to the earthly representative of ‘Alī and the Mahdi. From the middle of the 15th century to the 19th century, they came to dominate much of western Khūzestān Province in southwestern Iran.
Beginning in 1436, ibn Falah spread his messianic beliefs amongst the less powerful Arab tribes along the area of the present-day border of Iraq and Iran, gaining converts in an attempt to forge a strong tribal alliance.Britannica In 1441, they succeeded in capturing the city of Hoveizeh in Khuzestan, and during the following ten years the Musha‘sha’iyyah increased their strength and consolidated their power in the area around the city and the Tigris river. These early military ambitions were fueled by Muhammad ibn Falah's zealous millenarian theology, which continued to significantly influence the later military campaigns of the Musha‘sha’iyyah decades after his death. 
Successors of ibn Falah were  in continual conflict with the Safavid rulers as well as with Iranian Arab tribes until overcome by the Safavids in 1508.[ref]
[tpl]Citation | last =Momen | first =Moojan | year =1985 | title =An introduction to Shiʻi Islam : the history and doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism | place =New Haven | publisher =Yale University Press | page =102 | isbn = 0-300-03531-4 [/tpl][/ref] The conflict with the Safavids was driven not only by politics and territorial domination, but also by theological differences and competition between two rival Shi'a schools of thought. According to Moojan Momen, both sects adhered to heterodox (ghuluww) Shi'a beliefs.
According to Shī‘ah eschatology, the Mahdi will appear at the end times to lead the forces of good, who will be based in Yemen, to struggle against the forces of evil, who will be based in Syria and Khorasan. The Musha‘sha’iyyah believed that the end times were imminent and that they would need to defeat the Safavids and gain control of Iran in order to fulfill the prophecy heralded by ibn Falah.
The Musha‘sha’iyyah gradually abandoned their eschatological beliefs and more closely adhered to mainstream Shī‘ah orthodoxy. Like other mystical Shī‘ah sects, they placed a great deal of importance upon poetry and art.
Unreferenced sources indicate that their rule ended towards the 19th century with the rise to power of the Bani Kaab, which under the leadership of Sheikh Jabir al-Kaabi had become the dominant power in the western region of Iran. However, Momen writes that by the 16th century they were already reduced to being simply the governors of Khuzestan.

[[Benchrest shooting]]
CATEGORIES: Rifle shooting sports

Benchrest shooting is a sport in which very accurate and precise rifles are shot at paper targets. The rifles ride on a front and rear rest, the rests may or may not be joined, depending on the rules of a particular competition. The rests sit on a table or bench, hence the name "benchrest." The shooter simply sits at the bench, in distinction to other shooting disciplines, where the shooter holds and aims the rifle without the benefit of a rest. The post-Civil War era "double rest" rifles were one early form of "benchrest" rifles.
Benchrest shooters are notoriously detail-oriented and constantly trying to further the accuracy potential of the rifle through experimentation.  Nearly all benchrest rifles are custom made, and many shooters do their own gunsmithing.[tpl]cite web|last=Gottfredson|first=Jacob|title=Winning budget Benchrest rifle|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_55/ai_n31326587/|work=Guns Magazine|accessdate=27 August 2010|date=March 2009[/tpl]  Nearly all shooters in centerfire competition handload their ammunition in order to tune it to their rifle.[tpl]cite web|last=Petty|first=Charles E|title=Benchrest loading techniques: Handloading Editor Petty offers a quick overview of advanced handloading tools and techniques|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_4_48/ai_83483904/|work=Guns Magazine|accessdate=27 August 2010|date=April 2002|quote=It wouldn't be hard to argue that benchrest shooters are compulsive.

CATEGORIES: Foodservice, Cruise ships

Cruise ships consume vast amounts of food every day; as an example, the following is a list of supplies provisioned on board the Celebrity cruise ship Constellation, carrying up to 1,950 passengers and 999 crew, for an average 7 day cruise.
Of course, not all this food will be consumed during the voyage, the ship must keep a percentage in reserve to allow for delays, etc.  The figure includes all supplies for cooking meals in the three restaurants and buffets, room service, bars and lounges, as well as all baking and confectionery supplies, for officers and crew as well as passengers.
The Constellation at full capacity feeds 3 meals a day to over 1950 passengers and 999 officers and crew, comparable to the provisions that any small town might consume in one week.

CATEGORIES: Prehistoric fish, Paleontology

Prehistoric fish are early fish that are known only from fossil records. They are the earliest known vertebrates, and include the first and extinct fish that lived through the Cambrian to the Quaternary. The study of prehistoric fish is called paleoichthyology. A few living forms, such as the coelacanth are also referred to as prehistoric fish, or even living fossils, due to their current rarity and similarity to extinct forms. Fish which have become recently extinct are not usually referred to as prehistoric fish.

The Kent Archaeological Society was founded in 1857 to promote the study and publication of archaeology and history, especially that pertaining to the ancient county of Kent in England. This includes the modern administrative county as well as areas now subsumed by south east London and in the district of Medway.
It carries out archaeological surveys and excavations funded through membership subscriptions as well as being involved in the protection and recording of historic buildings and churches. In addition, it organises lectures, excursions and other education projects and can make grants or loans of equipment to archaeological projects. A library in the museum at Maidstone is available for members' use and a field school is often run in the summer.
It publishes an annual journal, Archaeologia Cantiana, and a quarterly newsletter. Through its Record Series, it publishes editions of archival texts relating to the county, and it therefore functions as the record society for Kent. It also publishes other occasional volumes on specific topics.
Recent projects include assisting in the excavation of the Ringlemere barrow and a translation and record of the Kent Hundred Rolls. A number of local societies are affiliated to it and it has links with national and county archaeological organisations.

Uzungöl is also the name of the village on the lake's coast. Over the years, the picturesque lake, its village and the surrounding valley have become popular tourist attractions. The lake is at a distance of 99 km from Trabzon's city center, and 19 km from Çaykara's district center.Uzungöl: A lakeside heaven in Trabzon It was formed by a landslide, which transformed the stream bed into a natural dam, in the valley of the Haldizen Stream.Haldizen Valley and Uzungöl travel
The area is most famous for its natural beauty. Located in a valley between high rising mountains, the lake and village at first appear inaccessible. The surrounding greenery of the mountain forests and fog, occasionally enveloping the lake at night, also add to the scenery.
The tourist boom of the recent years has attracted investors, who opened a number of hotels, restaurants, and souvenir shops in the village. The transport infrastructure has also been greatly improved. In 2008, the government built a concrete barrier along the lake's shoreline, so that its waves would not wet the coastal roads around it. This has triggered protests by the locals, as well as ecologists concerned with environmental damage, who stated that it has turned the lake into a giant artificial pool.Radikal: "Uzungöl'ün beton kaderi"

[[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)]]
CATEGORIES: Government of Poland, Government audit, Judiciary of Poland

The Supreme Audit Office ([tpl]Lang-pl|Najwyższa Izba Kontroli[/tpl], abbreviated NIK, also translated as Supreme Chamber of Control) is the supreme audit institution and also one of the oldest state institutions in Poland, created under the Second Republic on February 7, 1919, barely 3 months after the restoration of Poland's independence. It was created on the initiative of the Head of State, Józef Piłsudski. Its organisation and functioning are set out in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and the NIK Act of 23 December 1994. The NIK is subordinate to the Sejm (lower chamber of the Polish Parliament) and it acts in accordance with the principle of collegiate responsibility. The NIK is headed by the President who is appointed by the Sejm for a six-year term of office. The NIK performs audits related to, primarily, the execution of the state budget as well as public finance spending and management of public property by state and local governmental bodies and economic entities. Every year, the NIK submits three key documents to the Sejm: the analysis of the state budget execution and monetary policy guidelines, the opinion on the vote of discharge for the Council of Ministers and the annual report on the NIK’s activity.
From its very first day, NIK has been the country's supreme audit institution, empowered to exercise wide-ranging audit of the revenue and expenditure of the state and all institutions and corporations that make use of public funds. NIK is entitled to audit all state institutions, government and local government administrative units, together with those corporate bodies and non-governmental organisations which perform public contracts or receive government grants and guarantees. 
The Constitution of the Republic of Poland, and the statute relating to the NIK, determine that the Polish SAI functions on the principle of collegiate responsibility. The Speaker of the Parliament appoints members of the College for a three-year tenure. The tasks of the College include the approval of the analysis of the state budget execution and the principles of fiscal policy, the audit of the NIK’s performance, formulating an opinion concerning certification of performance of duties part of discharge procedure of the government, the work plan and the draft budget for the NIK. The College assesses audit programmes and the outcomes of particularly important audits. It also considers post audit objections.
Under the current regulations, NIK is answerable to the Sejm, which appoints its President for a 6-year term, with the approval of the Senate. Terms of office of the President of the NIK do not necessarily coincide with those of the Parliament, which in practice prevents this office from being dependent on any political party. Like members of the Sejm, the President of NIK also enjoys immunity: he cannot be arrested or indicted without the consent of the Sejm. Currently, the post of the President of the NIK is held by Krzysztof Kwiatkowski, appointed on August 27, 2013.
The Supreme Audit Office operates through its Departments and Regional Branches. The division into Departments reflects the scope of the matters it audits, and thus NIK includes the following Departments:
Other Departments of the NIK:
The division into Regional Branches is connected with the territorial division of Poland. The number of NIK Regional Branches, 16, equals that of the voivodeships.
NIK institutes audit proceedings on its own initiative, at the request of Sejm or its bodies or representatives (e.g. the Speaker of Sejm), the President of the Republic, or the Prime Minister. Special types of NIK activities include audits of the state budget execution and of the principles of monetary policy, as well as the NIK opinion in votes of confidence for the Council of Ministers.
The NIK fulfils its tasks based on periodic work plans. In the first instance, the audit of the state budget execution is completed, as the NIK is legally bound to conduct this activity. NIK undertakes other audits according to prioritised directions established by the NIK College for a period of three years. The NIK establishes whether the state fulfils its obligations towards its citizens, as well as indicates areas in which there are concerns, in particular ones that could be hindering proper development. Each year new audit areas are selected according to which specific themes for planned audits are programmed. NIK can also undertake ad hoc audits.
The Supreme Audit Office cooperates with similar bodies in the European Union countries, with the European Court of Auditors, International Board of Auditors for NATO, as well as the auditing authorities in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, and Hungary.
The Supreme Audit Office also cooperates with its European partners within the framework of EUROSAI - the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions, which is one of seven regional groups of INTOSAI - the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions. Jacek Jezierski, President of the NIK was the Chair of EUROSAI Governing Board in 2008-2011.

Hawaii Preparatory Academy (also known as HPA) is a coeducational, boarding, independent school in Kamuela, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i teaching kindergarten through the twelfth grade.  Founded in 1949 by The Right Reverend Harry S. Kennedy, Episcopal Bishop of Honolulu, the school came of age under the leadership of James Monroe Taylor II, Headmaster from 1954-1974. Originally the school was located on the grounds of St. James Episcopal Church in Kamuela in buildings that were built as barracks for the United States Marines during World War II. 
Currently the nationally recognized high school features three dormitories- Anna's for girls, Hartwells' for boys, and Robertson's, the co-ed and smallest of the dorms.
As a side note, Kamuela, the town where HPA is located, is usually called Waimea by the locals. Kamuela is adopted since there are three towns called Waimea in the state of Hawai'i, and Kamuela is used to distinguish locations by USPS.
HPA is now divided into a lower school, middle school and upper school.  The lower and middle school together compose one campus in the ranch region of the Big Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. The upper school is located at the foot of the Kohala Mountains.  The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
The upper campus has a weight room, wrestling room, pool, school library, an indoor tennis facility, baseball field, gym, bookstore, as well as a new (2008) softball field, a newly repaired football/soccer field and a new rubber track.  The school also is host to a cross country course. Along with classrooms, an art building, multiple Mac equipped computer labs and a theater, and an Energy Lab, the only of its kind in the world.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] There is also a church on the property built before the school moved to its presents site.
The village campus is in the middle of the town of Waimea, and features the only school-owned professional art-gallery in the State, Isaacs Art Center. The village campus also has two soccer fields.
The school also has a successful boys cross country team. Two male champions in the recent years include Mac Crommett (Class of '07) and Emmett Weatherford (Class of '05). Their girls cross country team has also been successful.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The HPA robotics team is the recent state champions of the 2009 Botball competition.
The school colors are red and white. The school's mascot is Ka Makani, which is Hawaiian for "the wind". (The campus is noteworthy for the steady winds which blow around it at speeds averaging 20 MPH)

CATEGORIES: Diseases of the eye and adnexa

Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (PION) is a medical condition characterized by damage to the retrobulbar portion of the optic nerve due to ischemia, a restriction of the blood supply to the optic nerve.  Despite the term posterior this pathophysiology may be applied to cases where the ischemic damage is anterior, as the condition describes a particular mechanism of visual loss as much as the location of damage in the optic nerve.  Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is distinguished from PION by the fact that AION occurs spontaneously and unilaterally in patients with predisposing anatomy and cardiovascular risk factors.

The Ethnic Minority Party was a New Zealand political party which focused on Asian voters, particularly Chinese and Indians.
The party was formed on 2 April 1996, and hoped to take advantage of the benefits given to smaller parties by the new MMP electoral system. It was organised by Robert Hum, an immigrant to New Zealand from Malaysia. The party's foundation came as the anti-immigration New Zealand First party made significant gains in the polls. In the 1996 elections, it stood a list of eleven candidates, and received 0.12% of the vote.[tpl]cite web |title=Part III - Party Lists of unsuccessful Registered Parties |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_1996/pdf/3.4%20Party%20Lists%20of%20Unsuccessful%20Registered%20Parties.pdf |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=14 June 2013 |format=PDF[/tpl]
In 1997, the Ethnic Minority Party merged into the United New Zealand party, and in the 1999 elections, many Ethnic Minority Party candidates were in high positions on United's list. However, United won only a single seat, leaving the Ethnic Minority candidates outside Parliament. Later, United merged with Future New Zealand to create the modern United Future, and the Ethnic Minority influence has been considerably diluted.

The townland is in County Down and the electoral ward is part of the Pottinger district electoral area of Belfast City Council.
The ward was created in 1973 with most of the population coming from the former Pottinger ward. The ward was slightly enlarged in 1985, taking in part of the Island ward.
The ward consists of two distinct districts : Ballymacarrett itself, which is almost entirely Protestant, and the Short Strand which is almost entirely Catholic, with the two separated by a peaceline. Consequently in the 2001 census, the Roman Catholic community background figure was 51%.
Set in the shadows of the Harland and Wolff cranes Samson & Goliath, large numbers of local men worked in the shipyard during its heyday. The area is also well known for 'Ulster's Freedom Corner', a series of loyalist murals.

[[Steady state (biochemistry)]]
CATEGORIES: Membrane biology

In ionic steady state, cells maintain different internal and external concentrations of various ionic species.http://www.okcu.edu/biology/BIOL3403/diffusion.pdf 
The following is an inaccurate and unsupported statement, be warned:
Cell membranes are permeable to potassium and various other ions, so in order to maintain a constant ionic concentration the cell must expend energy to actively transport these ions against the electrochemical gradient, out of the cell, at the same rate as they diffuse inward.  Conversely, membranes are not permeable to sodium, so this ion must be actively pumped into the cell.  Sodium and potassium pumps in the membrane are thus responsible for the differences in the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of these ions. The unequal distribution of ions represents a steady state (and not an equilibrium) as it requires the continual expenditure of cellular energy. Ionic steady state is a form of homeostasis.

Deterring Democracy is a book published in 1991 by Noam Chomsky, which explores the differences between the humanitarian rhetoric and imperialistic reality of United States foreign policy and how it affects various countries around the world.
In the book, Chomsky explores the idea that the US is the only remaining world superpower that works to maintain its dominance, even ruthlessly employing violence such as outright invasions and overthrowing governments pursuing independent economic policies. He also discusses the large difference between public opinion on the Cold War, establishment American educated opinion and reality.
The book also contains criticism aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist states, but its major point centres on the fact that although the United States claimed to support freedom in the Cold War, it still supported authoritarian regimes. The conclusion that Chomsky comes to is that, despite U.S claims of supporting freedom, their actual aim was maintaining dominance over resources and geopolitical power.

[[A Star Is Burns]]

CATEGORIES: Crossover animation, The Simpsons (season 6) episodes, 1995 television episodes

"A Star Is Burns" is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons sixth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 5, 1995. In the episode, Springfield decides to hold a film festival, and famed critic Jay Sherman is invited to be a judge. Homer, feeling that Marge does not respect him, asks that he be put on the jury panel and ends up voting for the stupidest movie.
The story involves a crossover with the short-lived animated series The Critic. Jay Sherman was the main character on the show. The Critic was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had previously written for The Simpsons but left following the fourth season, and produced by James L. Brooks, who was also a producer for The Simpsons. The show had premiered on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network in January 1994 but was canceled despite positive critical reception. The series was switched over to Fox, and put in the timeslot directly after The Simpsons. Brooks pitched a crossover episode as a way to promote The Critic and decided that a film festival would be a good way to introduce Sherman.
Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, reacted negatively when he heard about this episode, feeling that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the program pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode "violates the Simpsons' universe." In response, Brooks said "I am furious with Matt, ... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. ... his behavior right now is rotten."
The episode was directed by Susie Dietter and was the first episode to be written by Ken Keeler. Jon Lovitz, the star of The Critic, guest stars as Jay Sherman, while Maurice LaMarche (who was also a regular on The Critic) has a few minor roles. Sherman later became an infrequently recurring character on The Simpsons. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom felt the crossover was out of place on the show although Barney's film festival entry was well received.

The House of the Virgin Mary (Turkish: Meryem ana or Meryem Ana Evi, "Mother Mary's House") is a Catholic and Muslim shrine located on Mt. Koressos (Turkish: Bülbüldağı, "Mount Nightingale") in the vicinity of Ephesus, [tpl]convert|7|km[/tpl] from Selçuk in Turkey.Frommer's Turkey by Lynn A. Levine 2010 ISBN 0-470-59366-0 pages 254-255
The house was discovered in the 19th century by following the descriptions in the reported visions of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774–1824), a Roman Catholic nun and visionary, which were published as a book by Clemens Brentano after her death. The Catholic Church has never pronounced in favour or against the authenticity of the house, but nevertheless maintains a steady flow of pilgrimage since its discovery. Anne Catherine Emmerich was Beatified by Pope John Paul II on October 3, 2004.  
Catholic pilgrims visit the house based on the belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken to this stone house by Saint John and lived there until her Assumption (according to Catholic doctrine) or Dormition (according to Orthodox belief).The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIV, Copyright © 1912 by Robert Appleton Company, Online Edition Copyright © 2003 by K.

The shrine has merited several papal Apostolic Blessings and visits from several popes, the earliest pilgrimage coming from Pope Leo XIII in 1896, and the most recent in 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI.

[[Counterion]]

CATEGORIES: Electrochemistry, Salts

A counterion (pronounced as two words, i.e. "counter" "ion", and sometimes written as two words) is the ion that accompanies an ionic species in order to maintain electric neutrality. In table salt (NaCl), the sodium cation is the counterion for the chlorine anion and vice versa. 
In a charged transition metal complex, a (i.e. non-coordinated) ion accompanying the complex is termed the counterion.  In the older literature, the term gegenion is sometimes used.
Counterions are generally vaguely defined in biological systems.  Depending on their charge, proteins are associated with a variety of smaller anions and cations.  In plant cells, the anion malate is often accumulated in the vacuole to decrease water potential and drive cell expansion. To maintain neutrality, K+ ions are often accumulated as the counterion.  Ion permeation through hydrophobic cell walls is mediated by ion transport channels.  Nucleic acids are anionic, the corresponding cations are often protonated polyamines.

CATEGORIES: Populated places established in 1828, Villages in Islay

Port Charlotte  (Gaelic Port Sgioba) is a village on the island of Islay in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland. It was founded in 1828.
Port Charlotte was named after Lord Frederick Campbell's wife, and it was set up mainly to provide housing facilities for the Lochindaal Distillery work force. Parts of the former distillery buildings are now in use as Youth Hostel and Wildlife Centre. Others are currently used by a garage nearby. The remaining warehouses are currently owned and used by Bruichladdich distillery to mature their Port Charlotte heavily peated spirit, named in tribute to the village and original distillery. No plans have been formally announced to reopen Port Charlotte Distillery to date.
The village is located on the shores of Loch Indaal and is very picturesque with its white painted houses.  It is home to the Museum of Islay Life which is located in a former Church building.
In October 1813, the American privateer 'The True Blooded Yankee' captured six merchant ships lying at Port Charlotte, casting them adrift and setting fire to three.   http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/268802/details/britannia+loch+indaal+islay+atlantic/?date=asc

[[Surface bundle over the circle]]

CATEGORIES: 3-manifolds, Fiber bundles

In mathematics, a surface bundle over the circle is a fiber bundle with base space a circle, and with fiber space a surface.  Therefore the total space has dimension 2 + 1 = 3.  In general, fiber bundles over the circle are a special case of mapping tori.
Here is the construction: take the Cartesian product of a surface with the unit interval.  Glue the two copies of the surface, on the boundary, by some homeomorphism.  This homeomorphism is called the monodromy of the surface bundle.  It is possible to show that the homeomorphism type of the bundle obtained depends only on the conjugacy class, in the mapping class group, of the gluing homeomorphism chosen.  
This construction is an important source of examples both in the field of low-dimensional topology as well as in geometric group theory.    In the former we find that the geometry of the three-manifold is determined by the dynamics of the homeomorphism.  This is the fibered part of Thurston's geometrization theorem for Haken manifolds, whose proof requires the Nielsen–Thurston classification for surface homeomorphisms as well as deep results in the theory of Kleinian groups.  In geometric group theory the fundamental groups of such bundles give an important class of HNN-extensions: that is, extensions of the fundamental group of the fiber (a surface) by the integers.
A simple special case of this construction (considered in Poincaré's foundational paper) is that of a torus bundle.

[[Late Quaternary prehistoric birds]]

CATEGORIES: Late Quaternary prehistoric birds, Lists of prehistoric birds, Taxonomic lists (species)

Prehistoric birds are various taxa of birds that became extinct before recorded history, or more precisely, before they could be studied alive by ornithologists. They are known from subfossil remains and sometimes folk memory, as in the case of Haast's Eagle from New Zealand.
Birds (Aves) are generally believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs, and there is no real dividing line between birds and dinosaurs except of course that the former survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and the latter did not. For the purposes of this article, a "bird" is considered to be any member of the clade Neornithes, that is the bird lineage as exists today. The other lineages of the Aves also became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.
Taxon extinctions taking place before the Late Quaternary happened in the absence of significant human interference. Rather, reasons for extinction are stochastic abiotic events such as bolide impacts, climate changes, mass volcanic eruptions etc. Alternatively, species may have gone extinct due to evolutionary displacement by successor or competitor taxa – it is notable for example that in the early Neogene, seabird biodiversity was much higher than today; this is probably due to competition by the radiation of marine mammals after that time. The relationships of these ancient birds are often hard to determine, as many are known only from very fragmentary remains and due to the complete fossilization precludes analysis of information from DNA, RNA or protein sequencing.

MOJO is a popular music magazine published initially by Emap, and since January 2008 by Bauer, monthly in the United Kingdom. Following the success of the magazine Q, publishers Emap were looking for a title which would cater for the burgeoning interest in classic rock music. MOJO was first published on 15 October 1993; in keeping with its classic rock aesthetic, the first issue had Bob Dylan and John Lennon as its first cover stars. Noted for its in-depth coverage of both popular and cult acts it acted as the inspiration for Blender and Uncut. Many  noted music critics have written for it including Charles Shaar Murray, Greil Marcus, Nick Kent and Jon Savage. The launch editor of MOJO was Paul Du Noyer and his successors have included Mat Snow, Paul Trynka and Pat Gilbert.
While some criticise it for its frequent coverage of classic rock acts such as The Beatles and Bob Dylan, it has nevertheless featured many newer and "left-field" acts. It was the first mainstream magazine in the UK to focus on The White Stripes, whom it has covered as zealously as many older acts.
MOJO regularly includes a covermount CD which ties in with a current magazine article or theme. In 2004 it introduced the Mojo Honours list, an awards ceremony which is a mixture of readers' and critics' awards.
In early 2010, MOJO was involved in a controversial move by its new parent company, Bauer, via Bauer's attempt to unilaterally impose a new contract on all photographers and writers, which takes away their copyright and off-loads liability for libel or copyright infringement from the publisher onto the contributor. Two hundred photographers and writers from MOJO and Bauer's other music magazines, Kerrang! and Q were reported as refusing to work under the new terms.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/apr/19/bauer-freelance-contracts-row|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Bauer's freelancers up in arms over new contracts|first=Stephen|last=Armstrong|date=19 April 2010[/tpl]

Deteriorata is a parody of Les Crane's 1971 spoken word recording of Desiderata, the early 20th century poem by Max Ehrmann. (Desiderata is Latin for "things to be desired"; the word deteriorata is a portmanteau of "desiderata" and the verb to deteriorate.) The parody was written by Tony Hendra for National Lampoon, and was recorded as part of the National Lampoon Radio Dinner album, released in 1972. Voiceover talent Norman Rose read the "poem" and Melissa Manchester was a background singer on the chorus section of the song. Christopher Guest wrote the music.
Deteriorata was also released as a single, which stayed on the lower reaches of the Billboard magazine charts for a month in late 1972. In addition, a printed version of the parody became one of National Lampoon's best-selling posters. The parody gained some significance and popularity as a frequent presentation on the Dr. Demento radio show. Les Crane himself admitted to preferring the parody version over his Grammy-winning recording of the original poem.[tpl]cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-21/business/fi-342_1_les-crane-show/2|author=James Bates|title=Ex-TV Host Scores With Computer Game: Les Crane, Once a Rival to Johnny Carson, Is a Hit in Software|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=April 21, 1987|accessdate=June 8, 2005[/tpl]

In the latter part of the 1500s, the Bani Kaab settled in Khuzestan. They were powerful in the Arabistan emirate of western Khuzestan. Another branch of the Bani Kaab settled in the areas that are now Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
Individuals who are members of or are descended from the tribe often have the surname Kaabi or al-Kaabi. Those from the tribe who reside within Iran often carry the dialectal spelling variant Chaab.
Bani Kaab had their tribe flag as plain yellow banner. They have waged wars with neighbouring nations. For example, a famous naval battle, called Al-Raqah, occurred in the Persian Gulf between Bani Kaab and Kuwait. Bani Kaab were defeated by the Kuwaiti forces.

Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) is the tenth studio album by Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band. Released in 1978, the album was produced by Captain Beefheart and Pete Johnson and released by Warner Bros. Records.
Shiny Beast emerged from the production difficulties surrounding Bat Chain Puller, an album Captain Beefheart recorded for DiscReet and Virgin Records in 1976. DiscReet cofounders Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa feuded over the production of the album, because Cohen funded the production with Zappa's royalty checks.
Captain Beefheart recorded a new album, Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller), due to Zappa withholding the master tapes of the original Bat Chain Puller album. Shiny Beast was praised by music critics.

[[Pathfinder (web site)]]
CATEGORIES: Internet companies

Pathfinder is a landing page with links to various Time Warner Web sites. In its previous form, Pathfinder was one of the first Internet portals, initially created as Time Warner's entry onto the Internet. It was supposed to be an all-encompassing site that brought the best content from all of Time-Warner under one banner.
The site opened in 1994. It started with a small staff, which grew rapidly to service a growing list of internal "content partners" - at its highest point, these "content partners" numbered 80. Most of these content partners were Time Inc. magazines such as Time, People, Fortune and others, but others came from the widely distributed Time-Warner corporate empire.
Pathfinder.com was controversial within Time-Warner. Many content partners were unhappy with the fact Pathfinder's existence prevented them from using their own URLs. For example, People Magazine was not allowed to use the domain "people.com," but was instead restricted to a directory on Pathfinder (pathfinder.com/people/). Pathfinder's own staff were shocked when Time-Inc senior manager Don Logan publicly derided Pathfinder.com at an external analyst's meeting as a "black hole" of unprofitability. 
Pathfinder went through many managers and editors in its short life, and suffered from high staff turnover rates, especially after it became clear to many that its future was highly uncertain. Many early tech journalists passed through its doors, including John R. Quain (CBS News Up to the Minute and J-Q on Technology), John Voelcker (GreenCarReports.com), and Steven Petrow. Ultimately, the site was closed in April 1999, and was widely considered to be an expensive failure (some claim that Pathfinder cost Time Inc. between $100 and $120 million).
Some analysts believe that Pathfinder's failure led Time-Warner's senior managers to conclude that it was impossible to run a successful Internet portal, and this judgement led directly to Time-Warner pursuing its eventual merger with AOL, a merger which unsuccessfully sought to generate "synergy" between the two corporate giants.
Pathfinder.com transitioned to a landing page, with links to Time Warner's other sites.Time Warner to shutter Pathfinder Cnet News, April 26 1999

CATEGORIES: American children's novels, Novels by Louis Sachar, 1989 novels, Alfred A. Knopf books

The Boy Who Lost His Face (ISBN 0-679-88622-2) is a novel by Louis Sachar.  The story focuses on a group of young boys. One of them (David), joining in with the 'cool crew', helps to steal an old woman's cane.  When she finds them, she cries out, "Your Doppelgänger will regurgitate on your soul!"  meaning that his ghostly double would puke on his soul, according to a translation by David. Following this, the protagonist finds himself repeatedly experiencing the same misfortunes he passed on to the old woman.
Themes of the occult and youthful sexuality are explored in the novel, and its resulting suppression has garnered it position 49 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000.http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.cfm

Its key signature has one sharp, F (see below: Scales and keys).
Its relative major is G major, and its parallel major is E major.
Much of the classical guitar repertoire is in E minor, as this is a very natural key for the instrument. In standard tuning (E A D G B E), four of the instrument's six 'open' (unfretted) strings are part of the tonic chord. The key of E minor is also extremely popular in heavy metal music, as its tonic is the lowest note on a standard-tuned guitar.

Iio Sōgi, (or Inō SōgiHorton, H. M. 2002. The Journal of Sōchō. Stanford University Press. p.319) generally known as [tpl]nihongo|Sōgi|宗祇||extra=1421-1502[/tpl], was a Japanese poet. He came from a humble family from the province of Kii or Ōmi, and died in Hakone on September 1, 1502. Sōgi was a Zen monk from the Shokokuji temple in Kyoto and he studied poetry, both waka and renga. In his 30's he became a professional renga poet. 
During his travels to almost every corner of Japan, he was welcomed by the most powerful political, military and literary figures of his day. He attracted more disciples than any other poet of his generation.Carter, Steven D. The Road to Komatsubara, Harvard University Press, 1987, ISBN 0-674-77385-3, p.109 After traveling throughout Japan, he returned to Kyoto where he commanded great respect.
He is best-remembered for his renga, wherein two or more poets collaborate to create a poem, by writing alternate stanzas. In Sōgi's day, such renga were typically 100 verses in length. Arising from the court tradition of waka, renga was cultivated by the warrior class as well as by courtiers, and some of the best renga poets, such as Sōgi, were commoners. 
Sōgi is considered the greatest master of renga, his two most famous works being "Three Poets at Minase" (Minase sangin hyakuin, 1488) and "Three Poets at Yuyama" (Yuyama sangin hyakuin, 1491).Carter, p.2 This outstanding poet left more than 90 works (anthologies, diaries, poetic criticisms and manuals, among others). Before his death, he wrote "Sōgi Alone", which mostly includes his memoirs.

Retail therapy is shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood or disposition. Often seen in people during periods of depression or transition, it is normally a short-lived habit. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as "comfort buys".
Retail therapy was first used as a term in the 1980s with the first reference being this sentence in the Chicago Tribune of Christmas Eve 1986: "We've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy." [tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-12-24/features/8604060073_1_shopping-shaky-ground-festive-hat |title=A Stopwatch On Shopping |last1=Schmich |first1=Mary |last2= |first2= |date=24 December 1986 |work= |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl]
In 2001, the European Union conducted a study finding that 33% of shoppers surveyed had "high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption"."Shopping can make you depressed" This was causing debt problems for many. The same study also found that young Scottish people had the highest susceptibility to binge purchasing.
Researchers at Melbourne University have advocated its classification as a psychological disorder called oniomania or compulsive shopping disorder."Investigating retail therapy"

[[Congress Working Committee]]

Congress Working Committee (CWC) is an executive committee of the Congress Party in India, it typically consisting of fifteen members elected from the All India Congress Committee or AICC, and is headed by the Working President.
The Working Committee has held different levels of power in the organisation at different times. In the period prior to Independence in 1947, the Working Committee was the centre of power, and the Working President frequently more active than the Congress President. In the period after 1967, when the Congress party split for the first time, between factions loyal to Indira Gandhi and those led by the Syndicate of regional bosses including Kamaraj, Prafulla Sen, Ajoy Mukherjee and Morarji Desai, the power of the Working Committee declined; but Indira's triumph in 1971 led to a re-centralisation of power away from the states and the All-India Congress Committee, and caused the Working Committee in Delhi to once again be the paramount decision-making body of the party."Towards a More Competitive Party System in India", Ram Joshi and Kirtidev Desai, Asian Survey, Vol. 18, No. 11. (Nov., 1978), pp. 1091-1116.

[[Korsør Municipality]]
CATEGORIES: Former municipalities of Denmark

Until 1 January 2007 Korsør municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in West Zealand County on the west coast of the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in Denmark.  The municipality covered an area of 75 km², and had a total population of 20.644 (2005).  Its last mayor was Henning Erichsen, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Korsør.
To the west was the Great Belt (Storebælt), the strait that separates Zealand and the island of Funen peninsula.
The West Motorway (Vestmotorvejen) runs through the former municipality and onto the Great Belt Bridge (Storebæltsbroen), which spans the Great Belt.  On the other side of the strait the motorway becomes the Funen Motorway (Fynske Motovej) at the city of Nyborg.
Fishing and margarine production are economically important trades in this area.
Korsør municipality ceased to exist as the result of Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007).  It was merged with existing Hashøj, Skælskør,  and Slagelse municipalities to form the new Slagelse municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 571 km² and a total population of 76,185 (2005).  The new municipality belongs to Region Sjælland ("Zealand Region").

[[List of prehistoric insects]]

CATEGORIES: Prehistoric insects, Lists of insects, Paleontology lists, Fossils

Prehistoric insects are various groups of insects that lived before recorded history. Their study is the field of paleoentomology. Insects inhabited Earth since before the time of the dinosaurs. The earliest identifiable insect is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at [tpl]Ma|407|396[/tpl]. Forms similar to many modern insects had already evolved before the dawning of the dinosaur and lived alongside them and beyond up to the present day. Like today, prehistoric insects were an important part of the food chain in their time.
The differences between modern and prehistoric varieties can be essential, and, like many other creatures of prehistory, the latter tended to be much larger than their contemporary equivalents. This size difference is thought to be due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels (allowing diffusion through spiracles over greater distances), higher temperatures (enhancing metabolism), and the absence of birds as key predators of insect life.Giant prehistoric insects shrank to escape developing birds, Bloomberg News, 4th June 2012
Since insects have chitin exoskeletons rather than mineralized bones, their burial processes differ compared to the fossils of much larger vertebrates such as dinosaurs. Many insect remains are found preserved in the hardened sap of ancient trees (amber).

[[One-pass compiler]]
CATEGORIES: Compilers, Articles with example Pascal code

In computer programming, a one-pass compiler is a compiler that passes through the parts of each compilation unit only once, immediately translating each part into its final machine code.  This is in contrast to a multi-pass compiler which converts the program into one or more intermediate representations steps in between source code and machine code, and which reprocesses the entire compilation unit in each sequential pass.

[[Schiffler point]]

CATEGORIES: Triangle centers

In geometry, the Schiffler point of a triangle is a point defined from the triangle that is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the triangle. This point was first defined and investigated by Schiffler et al. (1985).
A triangle ABC with the incenter I has its Schiffler point at the point of concurrence of the Euler lines of the four triangles BCI, CAI, ABI, and ABC. Schiffler's theorem states that these lines are concurrent.
Trilinear coordinates for the Schiffler point are
or, equivalently,
where a, b, and c denote the side lengths of triangle ABC.

[[Operator-precedence grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Formal languages

An operator precedence grammar is a kind of grammar for formal languages.
Technically, an operator precedence grammar is a context-free grammar that has the property (among othersAho, Sethi & Ullman 1988, p. 203.)
that no production has either an empty right-hand side or two adjacent nonterminals in its
right-hand side. These properties allow precedence relations to be
defined between the terminals of the grammar. A parser that exploits these relations is considerably simpler than more general-purpose parsers such as LALR parsers. Operator-precedence parsers can be constructed for a large class of context-free grammars.

[[Aerobic conditioning]]
CATEGORIES: Aerobic exercise

Aerobic conditioning is a process whereby the heart and lungs are trained to pump blood more efficiently, allowing more oxygen to be delivered to muscles and organs.
Aerobic conditioning is a determining factor in performance in events with a duration greater than 2mins. On the athletics track this would include all events in excess of 800m.
Aerobic condition is usually achieved through cardiovascular exercise such as running, swimming, aerobics, etc. A stronger heart does not pump blood faster but more efficiently. Trained endurance athletes can have heart rates as low as the reported 28 beats per minute in people such as Miguel Indurain or 32 beats per minute of Lance Armstrong,The Lance Armstrong Performance Program ISBN 1-57954-270-0 both of whom were professional cyclists at the highest level.
Although exercising at lower intensities will improve aerobic conditioning, the most rapid gains are made when exercising close to an individual's anaerobic threshold.Arthur Lydiard's Guide to Athletic Training. A Guide to the Brooks/American Track and Field Lydiard Running Lecture Tour 1999 This is the intensity at which the heart and lungs can no longer provide adequate oxygen to the working muscles and an oxygen debt begins to accrue; at this point the exercise becomes anaerobic. Anaerobic training intensity for most individuals will be Once improvement in aerobic conditioning is apparent, for example in metabolism and oxygen uptake, the body will progressively adapt to further training.Olpin, D. M. (2011, October 14). Benefits of aerobic conditioning. Aerobic conditioning can be anywhere from walking on the treadmill to mowing the lawn. The average healthy person should engage in 150–200 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week. This amount of physical activity should help with maintaining a healthy weight and keeping the cardiovascular system in good condition.Davidson, J. (2011, September 2). Aerobic Vs. Anaerobic Conditioning. LIVESTRONG. Aerobic conditioning is an exercise at which allows oxygen flow to the cardiovascular system at a slower pace than anaerobic conditioning.
Aerobic conditioning has many advantages over anaerobic as it can increase physical endurance and lifespan. During aerobic training, the aim is to improve the blood flow to the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. This particular type of training targets large muscle groups so that as the intensity of physical activity is increased, overall fitness is improved.Mccord, E. (n.d.). Aerobic details.http://www.adapticom1.net/erinmccord/mm/ScieceFair7th/AerobicConditioning-sources.html There are many benefits to aerobic training, and the outcomes can be very rewarding. Aerobic conditioning can increase the duration that one can endure physical activity. This type of conditioning can help with heart disease, diabetes, or anxiety. Aerobic conditioning also has many non-medical benefits, such as improving mood, alleviating fatigue and stabilizing sleeping patterns. This overall type of conditioning has the most longevity to its practice and can improve a person's health and general well being immensely.Am J Lifestyle Med. (2010).

The unexpected existence of aperiodic tilings, although not Berger's explicit construction of them, follows from another result proved by Berger: that the so-called domino problem is undecidable.

Umberto D. ([tpl]IPA-it|umˈbɛrto di|pron[/tpl]) is a 1952 Italian neorealist film directed by Vittorio De Sica. Most of the actors were non-professional, including Carlo Battisti, who plays the title role of Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a poor old man in Rome desperately trying to keep his room. His landlady (Lina Gennari) is evicting him, and his only true friends, the housemaid (Maria-Pia Casilio) and his dog Flike (called 'Flag' in some subtitled versions of the film) are of no help.
According to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, this was De Sica's favorite of all his films.

The Kalaram temple is an old Hindu shrine dedicated to  lord Rama in the Panchavati area of Nasik city in Maharashtra, India. It is probably the most important Hindu shrine in the city. The temple derives its name from the statue of Lord Rama that is black. The literal translation of kalaram means black Rama. The sanctum sanctorum also houses the statues of goddess Sita and  Lakshmana. Thousands of devotees visit it every day.  The temple was funded by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar.
It was built around in 1788.
It was said that Odhekar had a dream that the statue of Rama in black colour is there in the river Godavari Odhekar took the status from river and built the temple and the place where status was found was named as Ramkund. –
The temple formed a pivotal role in Dalit movement in India. The famous Dr. Ambedkar once held a protest outside the temple for allowance of Dalits into the temple.
The main entrance has a Lord Hanuman deity which is black. There is also a very old tree that has Lord Dattatreya's footprint impressions marked on a stone. Pilgrims visit the Kapaleshwar Mahadev temple near Kalaram temple.
Authorised guides are available for reasonable price at Kalaram mandir who show around easily.

[[Cognitive apprenticeship]]
CATEGORIES: Educational psychology, Apprenticeship

Cognitive apprenticeship is a theory of the process where a master of a skill teaches that skill to an apprentice.
Constructivist approaches to human learning have led to the development of a theory of cognitive apprenticeship.Collins, A., Brown, J. S., & Newman, S. E. (1987). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing and mathematics (Technical Report No. 403). BBN Laboratories, Cambridge, MA. Centre for the Study of Reading, University of Illinois. January, 1987.Brown, J. S., Collins, A., & Duguid, P. (1989). Situated cognition and the culture of learning. Educational Researcher, 18, 32-42.  This theory holds that masters of a skill often fail to take into account the implicit processes involved in carrying out complex skills when they are teaching novices.  To combat these tendencies, cognitive apprenticeships “…are designed, among other things, to bring these tacit processes into the open, where students can observe, enact, and practice them with help from the teacher…”.  This model is supported by Albert Bandura's (1997) theory of modeling, which posits that in order for modeling to be successful, the learner must be attentive, must have access to and retain the information presented, must be motivated to learn, and must be able to accurately reproduce the desired skill.

[[Washington Supreme Court]]

CATEGORIES: Washington (state) state courts, State supreme courts of the United States, Washington Supreme Court justices

The Washington Supreme Court is the highest court in the judiciary of the US state of Washington. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and eight Justices.  Members of the Court are elected to six-year terms. Justices must retire at the end of the calendar year in which they reach the age of 75, per the Washington State Constitution.Wash. St. Const. Art. IV § 3(a).
The Chief Justice is chosen by secret ballot by the Justices to serve a 4-year term, with any justice elected to fill a vacancy in the office serving out the term of his or her predecessor. The current Chief Justice is Barbara Madsen who was elected to fill a vacancy in November 2010 and took office in January 2011, she was elected by her colleagues to a full 4-year term in October 2012.
Prior to January 1997 (pursuant to a Constitutional amendment adopted in 1995) the post of Chief Justice was held for a 2-year term by a justice who (i) was one of the Justices with 2 years left in their term, (ii) was the most senior in years of service of that cohort, and (iii) (generally) had not previously served as Chief Justice. The last Chief Justice under the rotation system, Barbara Durham was the architect of the present internal election system, and was the first to be elected under the new procedure, serving until her resignation in 1999.
The court convenes in the Temple of Justice, a historic building on the Washington State Capitol campus in Olympia, Washington.
The persuasiveness of the Court's decisions reaches far beyond Washington's borders.  A Supreme Court of California study published in 2007 found that the Washington Supreme Court's decisions were the second most widely followed by the appellate courts of all other US states in the period from 1940 to 2005 (second only to California).Jake Dear and Edward W.

The NWA Western States Heritage Championship was a short-lived National Wrestling Alliance title in World Championship Wrestling that was filled via a tournament in the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1987, and defended in WCW until it was abandoned in 1989.
It has long been reported that when Ric Flair took the NWA/WCW World Heavyweight Championship "Big Gold Belt" with him when he was fired and eventually went to the World Wrestling Federation, the NWA Western States Heritage Championship belt was used as the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt for one night at the 1991 Great American Bash; a gold plate with the words "WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION" was tacked onto the Western States Title's faceplate. In truth, however, Zbyszko took the title with him to the American Wrestling Association and was even photographed with both the WSH and AWA title belts. The actual belt used at the Great American Bash is now believed to have been the heavyweight championship belt that was used by the Professional Wrestling Federation, Dusty Rhodes' short-lived post-Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion.[tpl]cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 [/tpl]

The Little Drummer Girl is a spy novel by John le Carré, published in 1983. The story follows the manipulations of Martin Kurtz, an Israeli spymaster who is trying to kill a Palestinian terrorist named Khalil, who is bombing Jewish-related targets in Europe, particularly Germany, and the English actress Charlie, who becomes a double agent working on behalf of the Israelis. The novel does not feature le Carré's most famous character George Smiley.
Despite the plot, some reviewers thought it transcends the spy novel genre.See e.g. A. Broyard, The New York Times book review "The Little Drummer Girl is about spies", said William F.

Four-Calendar Café is the seventh and penultimate album by three-piece Scottish band Cocteau Twins.  It was originally released in 1993 on Fontana. The album distinguishes itself from the rest of the Twins' catalogue in two major areas: the sound is much more pop-oriented and less ambient than previous works, and Liz Fraser's lyrics are much more intelligible than usual.
The album takes its title from William Least Heat-Moon's book Blue Highways, in which the author considers the quality of a restaurant by how many calendars it has hanging on its wall.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cocteautwins.com/html/history/history16.html|publisher=Cocteau Twins|accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl]  NME named the album the 46th best record of 1993.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/bestalbumsandtracksoftheyear/1993 |title=Albums and Tracks of the Year: 1993|publisher=NME |accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl]

According to the ACS website:
ACS is centered around the idea that the law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. It works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.http://www.acslaw.org/about/mission

The Cahill Stadium was an arena in Summerside, Prince Edward Island designed for ice hockey events and was home to the Summerside Western Capitals hockey team, who won a Royal Bank Cup in the building in 1997. In March 2007 the building was closed to make way for the new Consolidated Credit Union Place, a multi-million dollar facility consisting of a much larger ice venue with close to 4,000 stadium seats. 
Though the building no longer stands, its memories remain in the minds of residents of Summerside. The Summerside Western Capitals hosted the Royal Bank Cup in Cahill Stadium in 1997, only winning 1 game in the round robin stage before coming back with an overtime win and then beating the South Surrey Eagles by a score of 4-3 in front of almost 4,000 people, although the stadium capacity was really only 1200.
In the last game held at the stadium, 1,322 fans watched the Western Capitals defeat the Charlottetown Abbies 7-3.

[[Maryland Route 404]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Maryland, Roads in Caroline County, Maryland, Roads in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, Roads in Talbot County, Maryland

Maryland Route 404 is a major highway on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the United States. It runs [tpl]convert|24.61|mi|km|2[/tpl] from Maryland Route 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 to Nassau (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 with the Delaware beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The road is a two-lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton, which is a four-lane divided highway.
MD 404 was designated in 1940 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day Maryland Route 8, Maryland Route 18, and Maryland Route 662 to Wye Mills (where it follows its current routing to the Delaware border). By 1948, the route’s western terminus was moved to Maryland Route 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The MD 404 designation was planned for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge; however, US 50 was extended onto the Eastern Shore and MD 404’s western terminus was cut back to its current location in Wye Mills. A few realignments of the route have taken place since then, including a bypass of Queen Anne and Hillsboro, a segment east of Hillsboro by 1960, and the bypass of Denton built in the 1980s.
Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009. As of 2013, the road goes from 2 lanes to 4 lanes and then back to 2 lanes several times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wboc.com/story/16935866/mdot-plans-to-make-safety-adjustments-to-404|title=MDOT Plans to Make Safety Adjustments to Route 404|date=29 Feb 2012[/tpl]

The Prime Minister of Jordan is the head of government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  
The Prime Minister is appointed by the King of Jordan, along with other ministers and members of the government that the new Prime Minister recommends. The Parliament of Jordan then approves the legislative program of the new government, before the new government formally takes office. There are no constitutional limits on a Prime Minister's term, and several of them served multiple non-consecutive terms.  
The past five years have seen six different prime ministers appointed. While the government cites this variation as a sign of the King's openness towards reform, critics claim it to be an attempt to distract from the King's perceived absolutism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sharnoffsglobalviews.com/refugees-jordan-147/|title=Refugees and the Arab Spring in Jordan|first=Michael|last=Sharnoff|work=Sharnoff's Global Views|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/jordans-experiment-does-top-down-democratic-reform-work/248000/|title=Jordan's Experiment: Does Top-Down Democratic Reform Work?|first=Shadi|last=Hamid|work=The Atlantic|date=7 November 2011|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]

It is an homage to Toei's ever-popular Super Sentai series, which was extremely popular in France in the 1980s. As a nod to Super Sentai titles having certain motifs, France Five has each member themed after certain aspects of French culture.
There have been four half-hour episodes of France Five produced. The fifth episode aired on May 5, 2012 during a projection in Paris, and will premiere in June for Japan and the French television, Nolife, created by the creators of France Five. The episode includes a preview of the sixth and final episode.
This series is said to be a nod to another Sentai pastiche, Aikoku Sentai Dai-Nippon (Patriot Squadron Great Japan) (1982) by Daicon Films (now Gainax).
Interestingly, the series has become somewhat popular in Japan as well, with singer Akira Kushida singing an original theme for the series starting with episode 4. Prior to that point, the themes were French remixes of older Sentai theme songs (Choujin Sentai Jetman and Choudenshi Bioman) as well as an original French theme.

"I Feel for You" is a song written by Prince that originally appeared on his 1979 self-titled album. The most successful and well known version was recorded by female R&B singer Chaka Khan, appearing on her 1984 album, I Feel for You. Prince, as songwriter, won the 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song.
Khan's version featured an all-star supporting cast, with rapping from Melle Mel, keyboard and guitar by The System's David Frank, and harmonica playing by Stevie Wonder. The song also uses vocal samples from Wonder's "Fingertips". The repetition of Khan's name by Melle Mel at the beginning of the song was originally a mistake made by producer Arif Mardin (actually a sample of Melle Mel's song "Step Off"), who then decided to keep it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5061890 |title=Arif Mardin: Tales from the Recording Studio |publisher=NPR |date=2005-12-19 |accessdate=2014-03-29[/tpl]
This version of the song became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and UK, and it helped to relaunch Khan's career. The song hit #1 on the Cash Box singles chart and peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in December 1984. The song remained on the Billboard Hot 100 for 26 weeks and became one of Billboard's five biggest pop songs of the year for 1985.

Nothhelm (sometimes Nothelm;Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 69 died 739) was a medieval Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury. A correspondent of both Bede and Boniface, it was Nothhelm who gathered materials from Canterbury for Bede's historical works. After his appointment to the archbishopric in 735, he attended to ecclesiastical matters, including holding church councils. Although later antiquaries felt that Nothhelm was the author of a number of works, later research has shown them to be authored by others. After his death he was considered a saint.

Xavier Mertz (6 October 1882 – 8 January 1913) was a Swiss explorer, mountaineer and skier, from Basel. He took part in the Far Eastern Party, a 1912–13 component of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, which claimed his life. The Mertz Glacier is named after him.
The son of a textile machinery manufacturer, Mertz studied patent law at the University of Bern, and science at the University of Lausanne, specialising in glacier and mountain formations. While a student, Mertz became active as a skier, competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many of the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson for his Australasian Antarctic Expedition. He was initially employed as a ski instructor, but in Antarctica Mertz instead joined Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis in the care of the expedition's Greenland Huskies. 
In the summer of 1912–13, Mertz and Ninnis were chosen by Mawson to accompany him on the Far Eastern Party, using the dogs to push rapidly from the expedition's base in Adélie Land towards Victoria Land. After Ninnis and a sledge carrying most of the food disappeared down a crevasse [tpl]convert|311|mi[/tpl] from the hut, Mertz and Mawson headed back west, gradually using the dogs to supplement their remaining food stocks. About [tpl]convert|100|mi[/tpl] from safety, Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone. The cause of Mertz's death has never been firmly established; the commonly purported theory is hypervitaminosis A (an excessive intake of vitamin A) from consuming the livers of the Huskies. Other theories suggest he may have died from a combination of malnutrition, a change in diet, cold exposure, and psychological stresses.

The Memorial Stadium was a 4,000-seat multi-purpose arena, in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. St. John's previous indoor arena, Prince's Rink, burned down in 1941, but the demands of the Second World War prevented the city from replacing it until well after the war ended. In 1948, a Citizens' Committee was established to raise funds to build a new arena to be named in honour of Newfoundlanders who lost their lives in that war. Fundraising went slowly until in 1954, St.John's City Council floated a bond to finance the facility, which then became property of the city. It officially opened in 1955.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~melbaker/citycouncil.htm|title=A History of St. John's City Council, 1888 to 1981|first=Melvin|last=Baker|publisher=Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, vol. 2 (1984)|accessdate=23 April 2011[/tpl]
It is the former home of the St. John's Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League (1991–2001). The stadium played host to many events, such as an exhibition game featuring the local senior hockey team, the St. John's Caps and the Soviet Red Army. It also played host to two NBA exhibition games and musical acts, as well as Pope John Paul II. Wooden bleachers were used throughout the building's earlier life, and plastic seats were installed later, towards the beginning of the Stadium's AHL tenure. Memorial Stadium closed in 2001, replaced by Mile One Centre.

Up Close & Personal is a 1996 American romantic drama film directed by Jon Avnet, and starring Robert Redford as a news director and Michelle Pfeiffer as his protegée, with Stockard Channing, Joe Mantegna and Kate Nelligan in supporting roles.
The screenplay began as an adaptation of Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch, a 1988 book by Alanna Nash that recounted the troubled life of American news anchor Jessica Savitch. The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter John Gregory Dunne, having spent eight years working on the script with his wife Joan Didion, later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, entitled Monster: Living Off the Big Screen.
The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song ("Because You Loved Me"), written by Diane Warren and performed by Céline Dion.

CATEGORIES: 1775 births, 1830 deaths, French pirates, American pirates, American people of the War of 1812, People from New Orleans, Louisiana, American people of French descent

Dominique You (1775-1830) was a privateer, pirate, and soldier.
Born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (which is now Haiti) in 1775, You joined the army of Revolutionary France as an artillerist. He served in the French Republic's artillery corp. In 1802 he accompanied General Victor Leclerc to Santo Domingo to quell Toussaint Louverture's slave revolt. Yellow fever took the lives of many of the French soldiers including General Leclerc. Afterwards You went to New Orleans where he joined his half brothers Jean Lafitte and Pierre Lafitte, where he became the captain on the French Corsair Le Pandoure. He was nicknamed "Captain Dominique" by the French and "Johnness" by the Americans. He acquired quite a reputation for being very bold and daring. During the next few years he and his brothers became quite successful smugglers in the Louisiana bayous, and as privateers preyed on Spanish ships in the Gulf of Mexico, doing extensive damage to Spanish commerce in the gulf. On one occasion, a storm on the Mississippi River caused severe damage to the Pandoure and almost killed Captain You.
In July 1814 You was falsely convicted of piracy in the gulf, but the Americans failed to capture him. You was in the camp at Barataria when it was raided by the Americans in 1814, and was captured and put in jail along with other Baratarians.[tpl]cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|title=The Encyclopedia Of the War of 1812|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC|isbn=978-1-85109-956-6|page=42[/tpl] Jean Lafitte offered to help General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans in exchange for his crew and a pardon, and You was released. You was appointed commander of a company of artillery, which was composed of the best gunners drawn from Lafittes' ships. His men fought with such courage and effectiveness in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, that they were mentioned in General Andrew Jackson's general order of January 21 as "having shown uncommon gallantry and skill in the field". Due to this, all charges against the Baratarians and You were dropped. After the battle, You settled quietly in New Orleans where he became a politician and supporter of General Jackson. You died in New Orleans in 1830. He was given a military funeral paid for by the public.
His grave is found in the historic New Orleans St. Louis Number 2 Cemetery. With the words attributed to Jean Lafitte, his grave bears the simple yet expressive inscription of an honored fighting man, which clearly conveys his place as patriot, privateer, and loyal friend:
"Intrpide guerrier, sur la terre et sur l'onde,

Il sut, dans cent combats, signaler sa valeur

Et ce nouveau Bayard, sans reproche et sans peur

Aurait pu sans trembler, voir s'crouler le monde."
Translated as:
"Intrepid warrior on land and sea

In a hundred combats showed his valor

This new Bayard without reproach or fear

Could have witnessed the ending of the

World without trembling"

[[Ali Baba's Tahini]]

CATEGORIES: Musical groups from Indiana

Ali Baba's Tahini is a South Bend, Indiana quintet that incorporates everything from jazz and fusion to rock and avant garde. The band, which formed in 1997, made a name for themselves on the Midwest club circuit and began sharing gigs with an up-and-coming Umphrey's McGee.
The original group featured bassist/vocalist Karl Engelmann, guitarist/vocalist Jake Cinninger, and drummer Steve Krojniewski. They released their debut album Hopi Champa in 1999. The album has become a sought-after collectors item since going out of print in 2002.
Engelmann left the band in 1999 and was replaced by Kahlil Smylie for the album Limbo Boots. The departure of Engelmann, one of the band's main songwriters and singers, was a drastic change for the band. A few months later, Cinninger disbanded Ali Baba's Tahini to join Umphrey's McGee, where he remains to this day.
Three years later in 2003, a four-man Ali Baba's Tahini (with Smylie on bass and Engelmann on guitar) reunited for a one-off performance in Niles, Michigan.
The following year, the original lineup of the band (Engelmann/Cinninger/Krojniewski) reunited in the North Carolina mountains to record the album Rockstars and Lawnmowers.
Engelmann fronted Asheville-based rock band Mother Vinegar from 2004–2007, who, along with Umphrey's McGee, performed a number of Ali Baba's Tahini songs in concert.
The band recorded Rockstars and Lawnmowers with former Mother Vinegar bassist Jeff Hinkle.  Ali Baba's Tahini has been hard at work on their new release, slated for Spring '09, which will feature new member and songwriter, Justin W. Powell (The Mantras) on keyboards.
A mini-tour through the midwest followed shortly after the release of Living Room.  ABT also did a one off appearance at Summercamp Music Festival to a crowd of over 4000 in 2011.

[[Ministry of Space]]

CATEGORIES: Sidewise Award for Alternate History winning works

Ministry of Space is a three-part alternate history mini-series written by Warren Ellis, published by Image Comics, starting in 2001. The book's art is by Chris Weston, and depicts retro technology in a believably 'British' style.
The story is set in an alternate history where soldiers and operatives of the United Kingdom reached the German rocket installations at Peenemünde ahead of the U.S. Army and the Soviets, and brought all the key personnel and technology to England, in a mirror of the real world's Operation Paperclip. Thus is created the Ministry of Space, whose mission is to develop British space technology and establish a firm foothold in space for Queen and Empire.
Elements of social commentary are present throughout the book, as is typical of Ellis' work, while the drama of the story is found in the lives of the first pioneers of space exploration (as in The Right Stuff). This social commentary is disguised in a snippet of dialogue here and a background detail in the art elsewhere, relying upon the readers' own observations to bring it to light.

Cecil Ralph "Tiny" Thompson (May 31, 1903 – February 9, 1981) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), first for the Boston Bruins, and later for the Detroit Red Wings. A four-time Vezina Trophy winner, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. He was a member of one Stanley Cup-winning team, as a rookie in the 1928–29 season with the Boston Bruins. At the start of the 1938–39 season, after ten full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he completed the season, and played another full one before retiring. During his NHL career, he recorded 81 shutouts, the sixth highest of any goaltender. After retiring from playing, he coached lower-league teams before becoming a noted professional scout. Thompson helped popularize the technique of catching the puck as a method of making a save. A competent puckhandler, he was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an assist by passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.

The country also has a flavorful material culture and a tradition in technology.
Russian culture started from that of the East Slavs, with their pagan beliefs and specific way of life in the wooded areas of Eastern Europe. Early Russian culture was much influenced by neighbouring Finno-Ugric tribes and by nomadic, mainly Turkic, peoples of the Pontic steppe. In the late 1st millennium AD the Scandinavian Vikings, or Varangians, also took part in the forming of Russian identity and Kievan Rus' state. Kievan Rus' had accepted Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman Empire in 988, and this largely defined the Russian culture of next millennium as the synthesis of Slavic and Byzantine cultures.[tpl]cite web|last=excerpted from Glenn E. Curtis (ed.)|title=Russia: A Country Study: Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods|publisher=Washington, DC: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress|year=1998|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|accessdate=20 July 2007[/tpl] After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the Third Rome idea. At different points in its history, the country was also strongly influenced by the culture of Western Europe. Since Peter the Great's reforms for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of European culture rather than pursuing its own unique ways. The situation changed in the 20th century, when the Communist ideology became a major factor in the culture of the Soviet Union, where Russia, or Russian SFSR, was the largest and leading part.
Nowadays, Russian cultural heritage is ranked seventh in the Nation Brands Index, based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from Western countries and the Far East. That's with the fact, that due to the relatively late involvement of Russia in modern globalization and international tourism, many aspects of Russian culture, like Russian jokes and the Soviet Art, remain largely unknown to foreigners.

Johannes Schöner (January 16, 1477 in Karlstadt am Main – January 16, 1547 in Nürnberg) (aka, Johann Schönner, Johann Schoener, Jean Schönner, Joan Schoenerus) was a renowned and respected German polymath. It is best to refer to him using the usual 16th-century Latin term "mathematicus", as the areas of study to which he devoted his life were very different from those now considered to be the domain of the mathematician. He was a priest, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, cosmographer, cartographer, mathematician, globe and scientific instrument maker and editor and publisher of scientific tests. In his own time he enjoyed a European wide reputation as an innovative and influential globe maker and cosmographer and as one of the continents leading and most authoritative astrologers.Norbert Holst, Mundus, Mirabilia, Mentalität: Weltbild und Quellen des Kartographen Johannes Schöner: eine Spurensuche, Frankfurt/Oder, Scripvaz, 1999.

The word Jäger (meaning "hunter" or "huntsman") is a characteristic term used for light-infantry or light-infantryman in German-speaking military context.
The mountain infantry of Austria have their roots in the three Landesschützen regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The mountain infantry of Germany carry on certain traditions of the Alpenkorps (Alpine corps) of World War I. Both countries' mountain infantry share the Edelweiß insignia. It was established in 1907 as a symbol of the Austro-Hungarian Landesschützen regiments by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These troops wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniforms. When the Alpenkorps came to aid the Landesschützen in defending Austria-Hungary's southern frontier against the Italian attack in May 1915, the grateful Landesschützen honoured the men of the Alpenkorps by awarding them their own insignia: the edelweiss. Together with the Fallschirmjäger (Paratroopers) they are perceived as the elite infantry units of the German Army.

James Brooks (October 18, 1906 – March 9, 1992) was an American muralist, abstract painter and winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts. Brooks was a friend of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner on Eastern Long Island. In 1947 he married artist Charlotte Park. Considered a first generation abstract expressionist painter, Brooks was amongst the first abstract expressionists to use staining as an important technique. According to art critic, Carter RatcliffArt International, February, 1973. pp 38-39 "His concern has always been to create painterly accidents of the kind that allow buried personal meanings to take on visibility." In his paintings from the late 1940s Brooks began to dilute his oil paint in order to stain the mostly raw canvas. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. Brooks had his first one-man exhibition of his abstract expressionist paintings in 1949 at the Peridot Gallery in New York.  The Courtauld Institute of Art (London), the Dallas Museum of Art (Dallas, Texas), the Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY), the Harvard University Art Museums, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, NY), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (Indianapolis, Indiana), the Sheldon Art Gallery (Lincoln, Nebraska), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), the Tate Gallery (London) and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota) are among the public collections holding work by James Brooks.

Grady Memorial Hospital, frequently referred to as Grady Hospital or simply Grady, is the largest hospital in the state of Georgia and the public hospital for the city of Atlanta. It is the fifth-largest public hospital in the United States, as well as one of the busiest Level I trauma centers in the country.http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists-and-statistics/20-largest-public-hospitals-in-the-united-states.html Historical segregation of its hospital units meant that it was also called "The Gradys," a name that still surfaces among elderly Atlanta residents, especially African-Americans. Located downtown next to the campus of Georgia State University, Grady is considered to be one of the premier public hospitals in the Southern United States.  It is named for Henry W.

The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the  Kingdom of Scotland. The unicameral parliament of Scotland is first found on record during the early 13th century, with the first meeting for which a primary source survives (referred to, like the contemporaneous Parliament of England, as a colloquium in the surviving Latin records) at Kirkliston (a small town now on the outskirts of Edinburgh) in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II of Scotland.K. Brown and R. Tanner, History of the Scottish Parliament, i, 'introduction'.
The parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Community of the Realm, the Three Estates ([tpl]lang-sco|Thrie Estaitis[/tpl]), the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament ([tpl]lang-en|old[/tpl]), met until prorogued sine die at the time of the Acts of Union in 1707. Thereafter the Parliament of Great Britain operated for both England and Scotland, thus creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain.Mann, Alastair, "A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament, Scottish Parliamentary Review, Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) Blacket Avenue Press

[[Castor Oyl]]
CATEGORIES: Comics characters introduced in 1919, Popeye characters

Castor Oyl is a fictional character, created in 1919 by cartoonist Elzie Crisler Segar for his comic strip Thimble Theater, now known as Popeye.
Castor Oyl is Olive Oyl's older brother. He was the main protagonist of Thimble Theater for years before the first appearance of the Popeye character in January 1929. A quick-witted yet diminutive adventurer, Castor Oyl continued to be an important character in Segar's Popeye strip, but played little (most usually no) role in the Popeye theatrical cartoons produced first by Fleischer Studios and then by Famous Studios. His most prominent appearance in the series is as a member of Popeye's orchestra in the 1935 short The Spinach Overture.
In the 1980 film directed by Robert Altman, Castor is a key character, and is played by actor Donovan Scott.  In the film, however, he is made Olive's younger brother and is considerably less sophisticated than his comic strip counterpart.
Castor Oyl is named after castor oil, a medicine often given to children back in the 1920s and 1930s. His mother Nana's name derives from "banana oil," an epithet similar to "baloney."  His father Cole's name derives from "coal oil," a now-obsolete term for kerosene.

This was one of the first demonstrations that many natural computational problems occurring throughout computer science are computationally intractable. This demonstration drove interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P = NP problem.

[[Codex Beneventanus]]

CATEGORIES: Gospel Books, 8th-century biblical manuscripts, British Library additional manuscripts

The Codex Beneventanus (British Library, Add. MS 5463) is an 8th-century illuminated Gospel Book.  According to a subscription on folio 239 verso, the manuscript was written by a monk named Lupus for one Ato, who was probably Ato, abbot the monastery St. Vincent on the Volturno, near Benevento.  Ato was abbot from 736-760.  
The codex contains the Vulgate version of the four Gospels, the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea, the letter of St. Jerome to Pope Damasus (Novum opus), the prologue of St. Jerome to the Gospels (Plures fuisse), and prologues and chapter lists for each of the Gospels.  The text is written on vellum in two columns in Uncial script with no division between words.  The running titles are in small uncials while the incipits and explicits are in capitals.  The incipits and explicits are written in alternating lines of red and black ink.  The subscription of Lupus is written in uncials, and also has alternating lines of red and black ink.  The text contains additional punctuation and annotations in a 10th-century Beneventuan hand.
There are 240 folios of 355 by 275 mm. The folios are generally gathered into quires of eight folios each. There are a few gatherings of ten folios and a few gatherings are lacking one or more folios.  The rear flyleaf (folio 240) is a piece of vellum from another manuscript and contains a fragment of a commentary on the Epistle to the Romans written in a 9th-century Carolingian minuscule that has 10th century Beneventan punctuation.
The manuscript has decorated canon tables, initials, and incipits and explicits.  The canon tables are underneath arches decorated with gold, red and blue.  Both sides of folio 4 have decorated arches, but are otherwise blank.  Each of the Gospels begins with an initial which is decorated in green, red, and gold.  The incipits and explicits are decorated with green red and black ivy leaves.
The manuscript was owned in the 8th century by the monastery of St. Vincent on the Voturno, and may have been produced there.  By the 13th century it was associated with St. Peter's convent in Benevento.  In the first half of the 18th century it was owned by Dr. Richard Mead, and was used by Dr. Richard Bentley in his collation of New Testament texts.  Dr. Mead may have acquired the manuscript in the 1690s when he traveled to Italy, however, the manuscript did not appear in the catalog of the sale of his library in 1754-55.  The manuscript was later owned by Anthony Askew (d. 1754). It was purchased by John Jackson in 1785 at the sale of Askew's manuscripts. The British Library purchased it in 1794 at the sale of Jackson's manuscripts.

The Anchorage Northern Knights were a team in the Continental Basketball Association from 1977 to 1982.
When the team joined the league, then known as the Eastern Basketball Association, it attracted national attention for being perhaps the most misplaced franchise in the history of professional sports. Playing in Anchorage, the team was 5,000 miles away from its nearest competitor, as all the other teams were based in the eastern Pennsylvania-New York-New Jersey area. League officials "began to see the publicity value a team in Alaska would have for the EBA, which, with an enlarged talent pool since the ABA folded, had been trying to upgrade its image from that of a nickel-and-dime Pennsylvania mill-town circuit—which is mostly what it had been—to something on the order of baseball's Triple-A leagues," wrote John Papnek in Sports Illustrated.
During the team's first two seasons, the Knights began their regular schedule with an extended homestand; then endured a mid-season bus trip to every CBA team in the league; then finished out the season with another homestand.
The Knights experienced success in the 1977-78 season, leading the league in attendance and often playing before sellout crowds.  They won the Western Division with a 24–7 record in 1977-78. The team advanced to the CBA Finals the following year, where they were swept in four games by the Rochester Zeniths, with whom they had begun to develop an impassioned rivalry. In 1979-80, the Northern Knights captured the CBA Championship by defeating Rochester in seven games.
Brad Davis played for the Northern Knights in the 1978-79 and 1979-80 seasons, capturing the CBA Newcomer of the Year Award in 1978–79. Davis then embarked on a long NBA career, highlighted by twelve seasons with the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, where he became the first player to have his jersey number retired by the NBA franchise.  Future NBA Clipper Ron Davis was a two-time CBA scoring leader; in 1979–80, he was CBA Most Valuable Player for the Anchorage squad.
Other favorite Northern Knights included Freeman Blade, Tico Brown, Steve Hawes, Arvid Kramer, Steve Hayes, Brad Branson, and Al Fleming.  The Knights were coached by Bill Klucas.

The sisters then went their own way, recording first under the name Birds of a Feather, and then as The Chanter Sisters, and it is under the latter that they enjoyed their only UK Singles Chart hit when "Sideshow" (not to be confused with the much bigger hit for Barry Biggs with the same title later the same year) entered the chart in July 1976 reaching number 43.
The sisters have been far more successful in their backup singing career. Their credits include work with Elton John, Long John Baldry, Phil Manzanera, Roxy Music, John Miles, The Secret Policeman's Ball, Van Morrison, Roger Waters, Meat Loaf, Joe Cocker and many other famous names. The pair also had uncredited bit parts as schoolgirls in the 1971 schlock horror film, Twins of Evil.
Although the sisters have predominantly worked together, Doreen has had the more extensive musical career, touring without her sister with several of the above named bands. However, the pair continue to work together in the recording studio, providing backup vocals for Chris Farlowe as recently as 2003.
Doreen also found success as a song-writer, being responsible for "Star", a UK hit in 1982 for Kiki Dee.

[[Deva (New Age)]]
CATEGORIES: New Age, Theosophical philosophical concepts, Deities, spirits, and mythic beings

[tpl]Other uses|Deva (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Deva[/tpl]
A deva in the New Age movement refers to any of the spiritual forces or beings behind nature.  The origin of word 'deva' comes from Sanskrit language. According to Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater devas represent a separate evolution to that of humanity. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the ecology function better.  It is asserted they can be observed by those whose third eyes have been activated.Hodson, Geoffrey, Kingdom of the Gods. 1952. ISBN 0-7661-8134-0
In addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the Sun, the indwelling solar deity of which Theosophists call the Solar Logos—these devas are called solar angels, or sometimes solar devas or solar spirits.  Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated.Leadbeater, C.W  A Textbook of Theosophy. 1912.Powell, A.E. The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution. London:1930. The Theosophical Publishing House. See the chart on page 44 called "The Evolution of Life"--this lifewave chart shows the various life forms that evolving souls inhabit as they reincarnate. The solar spirits living inside the Sun are shown at the top of the chart as the most advanced life forms in our solar system. Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other stars besides Sol; these are called stellar angels.
In the Findhorn material, the term refers to archetypal spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.
Some New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of etheric matter--elementals, nature spirits (including the various types of nature spirits such as fairies, ondines, etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article Deva (Hinduism).

[[Candy thermometer]]

CATEGORIES: Cooking utensils, Thermometers

A candy thermometer, also known as a sugar thermometer, is a thermometer used to measure the temperature and therefore the stage of a cooking sugar solution. (See Candy for a description of sugar stages.) These thermometers can also be used to measure hot oil for deep frying.
There are several kinds of candy thermometers available. These include traditional liquid thermometers, coil spring "dial" thermometers and digital thermometers. The digital thermometers tend to read the temperature more quickly and accurately, and some models have an alarm when the thermometer hits a certain temperature. Many models have markers for the various stages of sugar cooking.
A candy thermometer is similar to a meat thermometer except that it can read higher temperatures (usually 400 °F/200 °C or more).

Music journalists have noted the album for its innovative production, funk-based samples, self-assertive themes, ingenious lyricism, and complex rhyme patterns.
Although it charted modestly upon its release, Critical Beatdown has since been acclaimed by critics as a classic album of hip hop's "golden age" and new school aesthetic.

Sai Sha Road is a road in Hong Kong, which links together from Sai Kung District to Sha Tin District in the New Territories. The road also passes through some area along the coast of the Tolo Harbour in northern Sai Kung Peninsula that is under the administration of the Tai Po District. Before the area of Sha Tin New Town extended to Ma On Shan, the name of the road was called Nai Chung Access Road. The western end of Sai Sha Road was located in Nai Chung Bus Terminus in the early and mid-1980s until the first two housing estates in Ma On Shan was started to develop.
The western end of Sai Sha Road is located in the urbanized town centre of Ma On Shan in the Sha Tin District. Going towards the east direction, it then passes by some suburban areas  such as Wu Kai Sha (烏溪沙), Cheung Muk Tau (樟木頭), Sai O (西澳), Nai Chung (泥涌), Mak Pin (麥邊), Che Ha (輋下), Ma Ku Lam (馬牯纜), Tai Tung (大洞), Tin Liu (田寮), Nga Yiu Tau (瓦瑤頭), Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai (企嶺下老圍), Kei Ling Ha San Wai (企嶺下新圍) and Wong Chuk Wan (黃竹灣), until it reaches Sai Kung Town. 
Sai Sha Road has been well known of being narrow and precipitous in the suburban portion. Therefore, bus companies usually adopt buses of shorter length, such as the 10.6-metre version of the Dennis Trident model, for the bus routes that pass through such portions of the Sai Sha Road. The Government is planning to widen the road. The widening work in the area around the Wu Kai Sha Railway Station, which was opened in 2004, has already been finished.
Here are some of the bus routes that go via the suburban portion of the Sai Sha Road.

Mary Morgan Keipp (October 25, 1875, Selma, Alabama – 1961, Selma, Alabama) was a noted figure in the art photography movement of the early 20th century, exhibiting her photographs of rural Dallas County African-Americans in major exhibitions at the New York Camera Club (December 1899), the Annual Photographic Salon (November 1900), Dudley Galleries in London (October 1901), and the National Arts Club of New York Photo-Secession Exhibition (1902) organized by Alfred Stieglitz.
Born in Selma to a German immigrant father, Keipp began taking photographs as a hobby when she was 16.  When she went to nursing school in the Northeast she began exhibiting the photographs she took during her summers at home in Alabama's Black Belt. After graduating, she returned to Selma in 1904 and began her career as an Nurse anesthetist at King Memorial and Selma Baptist Hospitals. With no outlet to exhibit her work locally, the photographs were kept among her private belongings and not seen again until they were donated after her death to the Selma Depot Museum by her nephew's family.
Keipp's photographs depict rural African Americans going about their normal routines in the Reconstruction South. Typical subjects include laundresses, nannies, field hands, and children at play. No evident moralism or artistic propositions color her work, which occupies a place between documentary realism and impressionism.

The occurrence of Stewart's wilt in other eastern and mid-western states, and intermittently in Canada, coincides with the occurrence of the corn flea beetle (Chaetocnema pulicaria), the insect vector and overwintering host of P. stewartii. The primary vector of Pantoea stewartii is the corn flea beetle, (Chaetocnema pulicaria).[tpl]cite web|last=Plant and Insect Diagnostic Clinic|title=Stewart's Wilt|url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/info/plant-diseases/stewarts-wilt|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=2 November 2011[/tpl]  The bacterium overwinters in the gut of the adult beetle during the winter and come spring, is spread when adult beetles feed on the plant seedlings. The bacteria have also been known to spread from the endosperm of the plant seed to the young seedlings, but this is quite rare and its incidence is insignificant compared to insect transmission. Thus, survival of the insect vector through the winter months, especially in the north central U.S., is the key factor in development of the disease. The disease manifests in two phases: seedling wilt, when the growing point dies; and leaf blight, white lesions on the leaves of older plants. Sweet corn has proven to be more susceptible than field corn, although some hybrids and inbreds of popcorn and field corn are highly susceptible. One of the first forecasting systems designed was for preventing Stewart's Wilt.[tpl]cite web|last=Pataky|first=J.K.|title=Stewart's Wilt of Corn|url=http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/prokaryotes/Pages/StewartWilt.aspx|publisher=The Plant Health Instructor|accessdate=2 November 2011[/tpl] Apart from forecasting, Stewart's wilt severity can be controlled effectively through use of insecticides and resistant hybrids of corn, with resistant hybrids being the best means of control.

Davis was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 40, and established the Davis Phinney Foundation in 2004, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The Boulder, Colorado-based foundation is dedicated to improving the lives of people with Parkinson's disease – today and in future.

Phinney has looked to his son for inspiration and as a source of energy in his battle with Parkinson's. Before the 2008 Summer Olympics, where Taylor would compete in the men's individual pursuit, Davis told Juliet Macur of the New York Times:
 “I could easily slip into a very, very dark place with everything I’ve lost, so I have to focus on the pinpricks of light to stay positive,” he said. “But with Taylor, it’s easier. I just look at what he has been doing, and I’m instantly connected to a magnificent source of energy.”[tpl]cite web|last=Macur|first=Juliet|title=For the Phinney Family, a Dream and a Challenge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/sports/othersports/26cycling.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=March 26, 2008|quote=In August, if all goes well, he intends to be in Beijing, a new man watching his son ride fast, as he once did.

I just look at what he has been doing, and I’m instantly connected to a magnificent source of energy.'[/tpl]  
As Taylor was about to go to the Beijing Olympics late in 2008, Davis underwent deep brain stimulation in an effort to control some of his symptoms. Dr. Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University Medical Center, implanted two electrodes 2.5 inches into either side of Phinney's brain, powered by a pacemaker in his chest. According to ESPN, the procedure was risky and not promising, but worked instantly.[tpl]cite web|last=Reilly|first=Rick|title=Riding it out|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/8194683/davis-taylor-phinney|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 25, 2013|date=August 21, 2012|quote=Finally, in 2008, as Taylor was about to go to the Beijing Olympics, Davis decided to take a literal plunge.

And it instantly worked.[/tpl] Phinney explained:
 The doctor said, 'OK, let's try a little current now, and just like that, all these muscles that had been at war with each other suddenly were at peace. It was like Armistice Day. It was just like, 'Oh ... my ... god!' I looked at my wife and she was crying.

Unfortunately for Davis Phinney, the disease is setting in again. Doctors told him the brain pacemaker could turn the clock back on the progress of Parkinson's five years.

Dressed in a yukata, his skit always follows the same form. He says a supposed quote about someone famous, and then mocks the quote (and the person) and says "残念!" (zannen!, Too Bad!) Then he imitates the person and finishes that section with a "切り" (giri!, Slash!) as he makes a sword slash movement with his guitar. At the end of a set, he usually says some self-depreciating remark and ends yelling "切腹!" (seppuku!).  His popularity in this persona earned him an animated cameo in the Crayon Shin-Chan movie, "Crayon Shin-chan: The Legend of the Buri Buri 3 Minutes Charge" in which he played a monster that made fun of the sliding timescale of the cartoon (and thereby breaking the Fourth Wall).
After the novelty wore thin on the gimmick, he began to intermittently make appearances on variety shows under the Yoku Hata pseudonym and in regular street clothes. He has recently begun to bring back the "Guitar Zamurai" character sporadically, to play on its nostalgic appeal.  In 2008, he formed a clique of other one hit wonder comedians on the quiz/variety show, Quiz! Hexagon II called "Ippatsuya 2008" (一発屋２００８).

[[Spud (game)]]
CATEGORIES: Children's games, Games of physical skill, Tag variants

Spud is a Popular Game, for Children and adults, where players try to eliminate each other by catching and throwing an inflated and generally soft ball. It is related to "call ball" and "ball tag". As few as three may play, with no upper limit. A large, open area is required. The game begins with each player being assigned a number, in secret, with the highest number corresponding to the number of player. For example, if 5 people are playing, each player will be assigned one of the numbers 1 through 5. A player is chosen as 'It.'  The person who is It stands in the approximate center of the playing area, with one foot in front of the other. All of the other players must then touch one of their feet to its inward foot, and then step backwards 3 paces. This 3-step-backward set-up is required. When all of the players have stepped backward 3 paces, the person who is It throws the ball straight into the air and calls the number of another player. The ball must be thrown straight up. When the ball is thrown skyward, all of the players then dash away until the player whose number is called both (1) gains possession of the ball; and (2) calls out 'Spud!'  At that point, all of the players must freeze. If, while they were running, they were unable to stop immediately, those players must retrace their steps and return to the point that they were in contact with when Spud! was called. In no event may any of the players run around corners or hide behind trees. In all instances, they must be in sight of the player who has gained possession of the ball. At this point, the player who has the ball is allowed to take an identified number of giant steps toward one or more of the other players. Smaller, younger, or older players may be given the option of taking more steps. After the steps are taken, the person with the ball will try to hit one of the other players with the ball. The target player may not move his or her feet, but may duck, sway, bend, shimmy, and shift. If the target player comes into contact with the thrown ball in any way (even if he or she simply catches the ball), he or she is penalized with one letter (i.e., S P U or D), and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. If the target player does not come into contact with the thrown ball, the player who threw the ball is penalized with one letter, and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. When a player receives four penalty letters (S P U D), that person is required to go through a spanking machine, and a new game is begun. For another variation, a player who receives four Penalty letters is simply removed from the game, and the other players continue playing with their original penalty letters in place. When there are only 2 players left playing under this variation, there are two ways for the game to end. First, both players can be declared victors. Second, one of the removed players throws the ball into the air for the final round.
In another variation, the highest of the secretly-assigned numbers is 2 greater than the number of players. In this version, the 2 secretly unassigned numbers are referred to as 'ghost numbers.'  If the player throwing the ball into the air calls a ghost number, all players will then chase after the ball and try to touch it. While kicking the ball is permitted, players may not kick the ball if it is within 3 feet of another player (for purposes of safety). In this instance, the player may simply touch or punch the ball with another part of the body besides his or her feet. In this version, when a player is removed, his or her number also becomes a ghost number. In all instances, a player who wants to call a ghost number must throw the ball sufficiently high and in the air to remove any advantage that he or she would otherwise have.

[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)]]

CATEGORIES: African-American history of Alabama, Regions of Alabama

The Black Belt is a region of the U.S. state of Alabama. The term originally referred to the region's rich, black topsoil.  But because of the plantation agriculture supported by that topsoil, in which the workers were initially slaves and then sharecroppers, the population of the region was and is overwhelmingly black.  This sociological definition of the "Black Belt" refers to a much larger region of the Southern United States, stretching from Texas to Maryland but centered on the Black Belt of Alabama. 
In the antebellum and Jim Crow eras, the white elites of the Black Belt were powerful in Alabama state politics.  Montgomery, the Black Belt's largest city, has been the capital of Alabama since 1846.  Since the black population gained the right to vote, the voting patterns of the Black Belt have been in contrast to those of the rest of Alabama. 
Montgomery and Selma and other parts of the Black Belt were important centers of activity during the Civil Rights movement.

[[Ethyl methanesulfonate]]

CATEGORIES: Ethylating agents, IARC Group 2B carcinogens, Mutagens, Teratogens, Ethyl esters, Sulfonate esters

Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is a mutagenic, teratogenic, and possibly carcinogenic organic compound with formula CH3SO3C2H5.  It produces random mutations in genetic material by nucleotide substitution; particularly by guanine alkylation.  This typically produces only point mutations.  It can induce mutations at a rate of 5x10-4 to 5x10-2 per gene without substantial killing.  The ethyl group of EMS reacts with guanine in DNA, forming the abnormal base O-6-ethylguanine. During DNA replication, DNA polymerases that catalyze the process frequently place thymine, instead of cytosine, opposite O-6-ethylguanine. Following subsequent rounds of replication, the original G:C base pair can become an A:T pair (a transition mutation). This changes the genetic information, is often harmful to cells, and can result in disease.
EMS is often used in genetics as a mutagen. Mutations induced by EMS can then be studied in genetic screens or other assays.

[[Password synchronization]]
CATEGORIES: Identity management systems, Password authentication, Directory services

Password synchronization is a process, usually supported by software, through which a user maintains a single password across multiple IT systems.
Provided that all the systems enforce mutually-compatible password standards (e.g. concerning minimum and maximum password length, supported characters, etc.), the user can choose a new password at any time and deploy the same password on his own login accounts across multiple, linked systems.
Where different systems have mutually incompatible standards regarding what can be stored in a password field, the user may be forced to choose more than one (but still fewer than the number of systems) passwords.  This may happen, for example, where the maximum password length on one system is shorter than the minimum length in another, or where one system requires use of a punctuation mark but another forbids it.
Password synchronization is a function of certain identity management systems and it's considered easier to implement than  enterprise single sign-on (SSO), as there is normally no client software deployment or need for active user enrollment.

[[Load cell]]
CATEGORIES: Sensors

A load cell is a transducer that is used to convert a force into an electrical signal. This conversion is indirect and happens in two stages. Through a mechanical arrangement, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures the deformation (strain) as an electrical signal, because the strain changes the effective electrical resistance of the wire. A load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (quarter bridge) or two strain gauges (half bridge) are also available.[tpl]cite web|title=Wheatstone Bridge Diagrams and Equations|url=http://www.transducertechniques.com/wheatstone-bridge.aspx|publisher=Transducer Techniques[/tpl]  The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few millivolts and requires amplification by an instrumentation amplifier before it can be used. The output of the transducer can be scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer. The various types of load cells that exist include Hydraulic load cells, Pneumatic load cells and Strain gauge load cells.

[[Bart the Lover]]

CATEGORIES: The Simpsons (season 3) episodes, 1992 television episodes, Yo-yos

"Bart the Lover" is the sixteenth episode of The Simpsons third season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 13, 1992. In the episode Mrs. Edna Krabappel, Bart's teacher, feels increasingly isolated and, looking for a companion, places a personal ad in the newspaper. Bart, who was given a month's detention for breaking the class fish tank with his yo-yo, decides to get revenge by responding to the ad. He creates a new adult male alter ego named Woodrow, inspired by a picture of former President Woodrow Wilson, and Mrs. Krabappel becomes infatuated with "Woodrow". Meanwhile, Ned Flanders asks Homer to cut down on his swearing, so Homer starts using a swear jar.
The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered on Mrs. Krabappel that examined what it was like to have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially in response to the many complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free.
In its original airing on the Fox Network during February sweeps, the episode had a 12.9 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked 29th, up from the season's average. Marcia Wallace, the voice of Mrs. Krabappel, won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her role in the episode.

[[Self-service password reset]]

CATEGORIES: Identity management systems, Cryptographic attacks, Password authentication

Self-service password reset (SSPR) is defined as any process or technology that allows users who have either forgotten their password or triggered an intruder lockout to authenticate with an alternate factor, and repair their own problem, without calling the help desk. It is a common feature in identity management software and often bundled in the same software package as a password synchronization capability.
Typically users who have forgotten their password launch a self-service application from an extension to their workstation login prompt, using their own or another user's web browser, or through a telephone call. Users establish their identity, without using their forgotten or disabled password, by answering a series of personal questions, using a hardware authentication token, responding to a password notification e-mail or, less often, by providing a biometric sample. Users can then either specify a new, unlocked password, or ask that a randomly generated one be provided.
Self-service password reset expedites problem resolution for users "after the fact," and thus reduces help desk call volume. It can also be used to ensure that password problems are only resolved after adequate user authentication, eliminating an important weakness of many help desks: social engineering attacks, where an intruder calls the help desk, pretends to be the intended victim user, claims that he has forgotten his password, and asks for a new password.

On weekends the station concentrates on traditional folk, Celtic, blues, afropop and world music including syndicated programs.WUMB website history and overview pageWUMB website program description page  Overnight programming starting at midnight and usually through 5am is a repeat of a portion of the previous day's programming; an announcement of this fact is made at midnight. The station has received many awards for its folk music programming.Contact Us
WUMB-FM operates as a noncommercial public radio-style station which carries some NPR programming. HD Radio technology allows WUMB to transmit a high-quality digital signal.HD radio page wumb.org 
Due to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in New England, WUMB operates at a modest 160 watts, effectively limiting its coverage area to Boston itself and its innermost suburbs.  To widen its signal, it operates a network of seven repeater stations across eastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. WUMB-FM can also be heard on the Internet at both low bit rate for those with dial up connection and in stereo for those with broadband service. 
Since 1998 WUMB sponsored a live music festival, called the Boston Folk Festival through 2009 but renamed to WUMB Music Fest in 2010 and 2011.  The first festival was held at scattered sites in Boston's Back Bay.  Since then it has taken place on the University of Massachusetts-Boston campus.   The event's future is now in doubt, as the station cancelled the 2012 festival.WUMB Music Fest
Since 2011 the station has carried a portion of the Newport Folk Festival from NPR Music live on its website. In 2012 the coverage began on Saturday, July 28 and will conclude the next day. The audio of the festival is being carried on air and its usual on line audio streams replacing its usual programming. The website still has a page from the 2011 Festival which makes access confusing. The page for the 2012 festival with an embedded player and the schedule is at this url address.
Until 2013, WUMB broadcast with 660 watts, with a height above average terrain of 63 meters; after the station lost its then-transmitter site, the station moved to a new site and began broadcasting with its present 160-watt facility.

The flowers are produced in dense inflorescences (capitula) held above the plant on a 1–30 cm tall stem; the capitula is 1–3 cm in diameter, with numerous tightly packed purple, violet, pink or white flowers.[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl]
Globularia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora virgatella.
Several members of the genus, such as Globularia cordifolia and Globularia punctata, are cultivated and sold for garden use.
Under the old Cronquist system of plant classification, they were treated in their own family, Globulariaceae, but genetic evidence has shown that the genus belongs in the family Plantaginaceae.

[[Squround]]

CATEGORIES: Packaging, Ice cream

Squroundhttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3301/is_103_102/ai_73541469/ is a portmanteau for "square round" (cartons), referring to a compromise between a square and a round carton. It is also sometimes known as the scround.
The term applies almost exclusively to ice cream packaging design, where the switch to a squround from paperboard bricks, cylindrical half-gallons and other containers is motivated by consumer preference.  These packages are more rectangular than square, but the side edges are rounded.  The top and bottom surfaces are completely flat.
Pierre’s French Ice Cream, when announcing their switch in May 2003, cited several reasons:
Smith Dairy, which made the switch that same year for its Ruggles line of ice cream, cited other reasons.  They note that the packaging makes tampering more evident, and offers better protection from freezer burn.
Although squrounds are available in traditional half-gallon sizes, changes in U.S. federal regulations[tpl]Fact|date=May 2009[/tpl] covering ice cream have led since 2000 to increased use of a smaller 56-ounce volume.   The downsizing in carton size has not seemed to affect unit sales.
Mayfield Dairy, which announced the switch to squround cartons in January 2003, told Food Engineering in April that they expect to sell the same number of 56 oz. units in 2003 as it sold 64 oz. cartons in 2002. Breyers, which in 2000 was an early adopter of the smaller package for its "Ice Cream Parlor" brands, [tpl]As of|2005|lc=on[/tpl] uses the smaller package across all its ice cream flavors.  In 2008, they changed to an even smaller 48 oz container.

[[Flower of Life]]
CATEGORIES: Patterns, Religious symbols, Mathematics and mysticism

{{Blacklisted-links|1=
The Flower of Life is a name for a geometrical figure composed of multiple evenly-spaced, overlapping circles. This figure, used as a decorative motif since ancient times, forms a flower-like pattern with the symmetrical structure of a hexagon.
A "Flower of Life" figure consists of seven or more overlapping circles[tpl]cite web |title=OEIS|url=http://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C7%2C19%2C37%2C61&sort=&language=english&go=Search[/tpl], in which the center of each circle is on the circumference of up to six surrounding circles of the same diameter. However, the surrounding circles need not be clearly or completely drawn; in fact, some ancient symbols that are claimed as examples of the Flower of Life contain only a single circle or hexagon.
Drunvalo Melchizedek, an author from the New Age movement, has called these figures symbols of sacred geometry, asserting that they represent ancient spiritual beliefs, and that they depict fundamental aspects of space and time.[tpl]cite book |last= Melchizedek |first= Drunvalo |title= The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life Volume 1 |publisher= Light Technology Publishing |year= 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Melchizedek |first= Drunvalo |title= The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life Volume 2 |publisher= Light Technology Publishing |year= 2000[/tpl] Melchizedek claims that Metatron's Cube may be derived from the Flower of Life pattern, and that the Platonic solids within it were "thought to act as a template from which all life springs."Many New Age websites use this phrase as does the Dallas, Texas architect Stephen B. Chambers: [tpl]cite web |title=Steve Chambers: A Dallas architect reviews Dallas historical architecture and its preservation|url=http://chambersarchitects.com/blog/12-restoration--rehabilitation/35-renovation-of-magnolia-petroleum-co-at-2130-commerce-street-in-dallas.html|work=Stephen B.

The Flower of Life and the Seed of Life are linked by New Age authors with the Biblical prophet Enoch, the Archangel Metatron, the six days of Creation, the Vesica Piscis religious symbol, and Borromean rings.

[[Garrison school]]
CATEGORIES: Russian Empire, Education in Russia

Garrison schools ([tpl]lang-ru|гарнизо́нные шко́лы[/tpl]) in 18th century Russia were military schools that provided the primary education for the children of the military recruits. The institution of the Garrison schools was introduced by the ukase (manifest) of Tsar Peter the Great in 1721 primarily for the children of military recruits in the course of Peter's reform of the Russian military. This so-called military revolution transformed the military from an archaic militia-like force to the regular army, which drew upon military recruits called, predominantly from enserfed peasantry, to serve for 25 years, which, given the expected life span of most Russian serfs at the time, essentially meant that they would serve for life. The recruits and their children born after the recruitment were liberated from the serf status and a network of Garrison schools was created for the children's education. The boys, starting from the age of 7, were taught literacy, elementary math, "artillery and military engineering", but also fine arts and several trade professions, such as shoe-making, sewing, wood- and metal-working, etc. 
Initially 49 schools were founded, each for 50 boys aged 7 to 15. Upon completion of elementary study course, the boys' education was specialized as follows: 10 boys studied artillery and fortification, 20 studied music (drums and singing), 10 studied trade professions and 10 studied advanced writing (письмоводство). Most school graduates entered the military service. 
In 1798, the Garrison schools were renamed "Military institutions for the orphans" (военно-сиротские отделения) which in turn were transformed into Cantonist schools.

Low-tech Magazine, 24 de agosto de 2008 Traditionally, the term "scrubber" has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term is also used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to "wash out" acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.On Flue gas Condensation by Götaverken Miljö AB

The AMC Matador is a mid-size car that was built and sold by American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1971 to 1978. The Matador came in two generations: 1971 to 1973 and a major redesign from 1974 to 1978. The second-generation four-door and station wagon models were classified as full-size cars and did not share the distinctive styling featured by the Matador Coupe that was introduced in 1974.
Factory-backed AMC Matador hardtops and coupes competed in NASCAR stock car racing with drivers that included Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison winning a number of the races. The new Matador Coupe was featured in The Man with the Golden Gun, a James Bond film released in 1974. AMC Matadors were a popular vehicle in the police market as it outperformed most other police cars. It was also featured in many television shows and movies during the 1970s.
The Matador became AMC's largest automobile following the discontinuation of the flagship AMC Ambassador that was built on the same platform. Premium trim level Oleg Cassini and Barcelona versions of the Matador coupe were positioned in the "personal luxury car" market segment. Matadors were also marketed under the Rambler marque in foreign markets, as well as assembled under license agreements with AMC that included Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM), as well as built in right-hand-drive versions by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) and by Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) in New Zealand.

CATEGORIES: Christian radio stations in the United States, Christian contemporary radio stations, Radio stations in the Charlotte metropolitan area, Radio stations established in 1993, 1993 establishments in North Carolina

WRCM, known on-air as New Life 91.9, is a radio station in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It airs contemporary Christian music and identifies itself as "Charlotte's Number One Family Friendly Station".  It is a noncommericial listener supported ministry of Columbia International University in Columbia, South Carolina, broadcasting at 91.9 mHz, as well as 88.3 mHz in Boiling Springs, North Carolina.
The station is licensed to Wingate, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, with studios in another Charlotte suburb, Indian Trail, North Carolina.
Columbia International University, then known as Columbia Bible College, applied to the FCC for the license in 1982. Internally, this was known as The 92 FM Project. Other entities applied on top of CBC including Wingate College (now Wingate University) and a church in Waxhaw, North Carolina area. After 10 years of negotiations with the other groups, WRCM was granted the license and was signed on the air by founding general manager Ken Mayfield at 12 noon on June 14, 1993. Present at sign on were CIU president, Johnny Miller; CIU vice president John Davidson and former CIU president, Robertson C. McQuilken. (The station's call letters -RCM- were in honor of his father, Robertson C. McQuilken, the first president of Columbia Bible College.)
WRCM's first staff consisted of full-timers Ken Mayfield, the station's first general manager and afternoon personality, program director and morning host, Rodney Baucom and Karen Wycoff who served as mid-day announcer and secretary. Mayfield had built and managed another contemporary Christian station, WNOW, and had hosted a very popular Sunday morning Contemporary Christian music program for 7 years on Charlotte's 100,000 watt WBCY (now WLNK). Part-time staff members included Shelly Mitchell and Joe Paulo. Paulo stepped into the role of general manager shortly after Mayfield departed in 1999.
WRCM garnered immediate success with a 2.4 in its first Arbitron ratings. This success was in spite of the lack of advertising. Almost all of the "promotion" for the fledgling station had to come by word of mouth and from the station staff at Christian concerts. 
Original plans were for WRCM to be a satellite station of Columbia Bible College's original station, WMHK.  However, these plans were scrapped, and the station has been largely operated and programmed separately from WMHK.  However, longtime general manager Joe Paulo was recently named director of broadcasting at CIU, with oversight over both stations.  Under his watch, WMHK has begun simulcasting WRCM's "Family Friendly Morning Show," and the two stations both air the syndicated "Scott and Sam" show on weeknights.
Although the station identifies itself as "New Life 91.9, WRCM Wingate/Charlotte" and heavily promotes churches throughout the Charlotte metropolitan area, its signal is not as strong as those of the major FM stations in the Charlotte area.  For most of its history, it operated at only 10,000 watts, resulting in marginal coverage even in some parts of Charlotte.  In many of Charlotte's inner-ring suburbs, it could only be heard on car radios.  It has since increased its power to 30,000 watts.  However, it still operates from a tiny (by modern broadcasting standards) 495-foot tower near its studios in Indian Trail.  This is necessary to protect WSGE in Dallas, which is located on adjacent 91.7 FM.  As a result, it still only provides grade B coverage to large parts of the market.  Most Christian music fans in the western part of the market get a better signal from WMIT in Asheville.
WRCM's music rotation consists of six or seven current songs in heavy rotation and a mix of six or seven new songs and "classics" from the last two to five years in medium rotation played in a tight format, often back to back with only the station jingle separating songs from each other. 
New songs are chosen with the help of the listener advisory panel. 
The station often promotes live concerts by Contemporary Christian (CCM) musicians, and carries out its Christian mission by performing good works such as collecting donations of baby clothes to support mothers in need who might otherwise consider getting abortions. 
WRCM uses the "Charlotte's Number One" Radio Jingle package from RadioScape. 
Starting in 2014, WRCM was simulcast on WRZM in Boiling Springs, North Carolina.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/04/25/4863312/davidson-students-bring-shakespeare.html#.U1vtcFcvD40|title=Davidson students bring Shakespeare drama to the radio|last=Washburn|first=Mark|work=The Charlotte Observer|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.shelbystar.com/news/local/gwu-to-sell-88-3-radio-frequency-1.238786?page=1|title=GWU to sell 88.3 radio frequency|work=The Shelby Star|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=23156&Callsign=WRZM|title=Call Sign History (WRZM)|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl]

Gross rating point (GRP) is a term used in advertising to measure the size of an audience reached by a specific media or schedule. Specifically, GRPs quantify impressions as a percentage of the population reached rather than in absolute numbers reached. Target rating points express the same concept, but with regard to a more narrowly defined target audience.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010).

A chinois ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʃin.wɑ[/tpl]) is a conical sieve with an extremely fine mesh. It is used to strain custards, purees, soups, and sauces, producing a very smooth texture. It can also be used to dust food with a fine layer of powdered ingredient.[tpl]cite web|last=Alfaro|first=Danilo|title=Chinois: Definition|url=http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/Chinois.htm|work=About.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Chinois [tpl]![/tpl] Resource|url=http://www.smartkitchen.com/resources/chinois|work=Smartkitchen.com|publisher=Smart Kitchen Online Cooking School|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Kimball|first=Christopher|title=Chinois Sieves Review|journal=Cook's Illustrated|date=July 2012|issue=July 2012|url=http://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1373-chinois-sieves|accessdate=4 December 2013[/tpl] 
Chinois is a loanword from the French adjective meaning Chinese.
A related utensil is the tamis - a flat strainer through which food is pressed with a scraper or pestle.
A similarly-shaped utensil is the China cap, a reference to the conical Asian hats common in China. It is a perforated metal conical strainer with much larger holes than a chinois. A China cap is used to remove seeds and other coarse matter from soft foods, but produces a coarser-textured product than the chinois.
Both the chinois and the China cap often are used with a cone-shaped pestle. With the pestle tip placed in the bottom of the strainer, it is rolled against the sides of the device to work liquids and soft food through it. In this way, the chinois functions much like a tamis, and the China cap functions similar to a food mill.

A sulfonyl group can refer either to a functional group found primarily in sulfones or to a substituent obtained from a sulfonic acid by the removal of the hydroxyl group similarly to acyl groups. Sulfonyl groups can be written as having the general formula R-S(=O)2-R', where there are two  double bonds between the sulfur and oxygen. 
Sulfonyl groups can be reduced to the hydrocarbon with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4).
In inorganic chemistry, when the group -S(=O)2- is not connected to any carbon atoms, it is referred to as sulfuryl.

James Inglis (born ca. 1922 – died 8 May 1951) was a British man executed for murder at the age of 29.
Having confessed to strangling Alice Morgan, a 50-year-old woman who was working as a prostitute in Kingston upon Hull on 1 February 1951 after a quarrel over payment, Inglis opted to plead insanity at his trial.[tpl]cite book |title=The Encyclopaedia of Executions |last= Eddleston |first=John J. |year=2004 |publisher=John Blake Publishing Limited |location=London |isbn=1-84454-058-8 |page=794[/tpl] The jury did not believe his version of events, and on 20 April he was sentenced by Justice Ormerod to be hanged. He was jailed at Strangeways Prison to await execution. Because Inglis did not appeal against his sentence, execution was scheduled to take place only three weeks after the trial ended (according to law, after the passage of three Sundays).
On the morning of 8 May 1951, the executioner, Albert Pierrepoint and his assistant, Syd Dernley, escorted Inglis from his cell to the gallows immediately adjacent, and hanged him without delay. This was the fastest British hanging on record, taking just seven seconds from the time that Inglis was removed from his cell to the moment that the trapdoor opened.[tpl]cite book |title=Pierrepoint: A Family of Executioners |last=Fielding |first=Steve |year=2008 |publisher=John Blake Publishing Limited |location=London |isbn=978-1-84454-611-4 |pages=239–240[/tpl]  Dernley later related that Inglis practically ran to his execution, following the prison guard's advice to go quickly and "without fuss".
Inglis's execution is featured in the 2006 film Pierrepoint.

Krishan Kant (28 February 1927 – 27 July 2002) was the tenth Vice President of India from 1997 until his death.
Kant's first brush with politics came when he plunged into the Quit India movement, while he was still a student in Lahore. He took part in the Indian Independence Movement as a youth and continued to be involved in politics, eventually being elected to Parliament of India. He was part of the "Young Turk" brigade of Indian National Congress party during the time of Indira Gandhi. He held prominent offices in the Parliamentary and Organisational wings of Indian National Congress and later the Janata Party and the Janata Dal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/chairman/kant.asp |title=Rajya Sabha |publisher=Rajya Sabha |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22[/tpl]
He was a member of the Executive Council, for several years, of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.
Krishan Kant was the founding general secretary of the People's Union for Civil Liberties and Democratic Rights, of which Jayprakash Narayan was the President in 1976. He was expelled from the Indian National Congress in 1975 for his opposition to the Emergency. He was later a member of Lok Sabha till 1980. He was the chairman of Committee on Railway Reservations and Bookings from 1972 -1976.
He with Madhu Limaye was also responsible for the collapse of the Morarji Desai government installed by that coalition, by insisting that no member of the Janata Party could be the member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This attack on dual membership was directed specifically at members of the Janata Party who had been members of the Jan Sangh, and continued to be members of the right-wing RSS, the Jan Sangh's ideological parent. The issue led to fall of Morarji Desai government  in 1979, and the destruction of the Janata coalition"In Pursuit of Lakshmi: The Political Economy of the Indian State", By Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susanne H. Rudolph, University of Chicago Press, 1987. pp 457-459.
A strong protagonist of India going nuclear, Krishan Kant was a member of the executive council of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis.
Kant was appointed governor of Andhra Pradesh by the V.P. Singh government in 1989 and served in that position for seven years, becoming one of India's longest-serving governors. He stayed at that post till he was elevated as Vice-President of India.
He was elected vice-president by Parliament as the joint candidate of the Indian National Congress and United Front. He died in New Delhi. He is the only  Indian Vice President to die in office.

Robert Stephen Ingersoll (January 28, 1914 – August 22, 2010) was an American businessman and former diplomat. Ingersoll was Chief executive officer and Chairman of the Board of BorgWarner and his international business experience was an important factor in his selection as United States Ambassador to Japan from 1972 to 1973, and assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 1973 to 1974, both during President Richard Nixon's term in office. He served as United States Deputy Secretary of State from 1974 to 1976 under both Presidents Nixon and Gerald Ford.
Ingersoll was born on January 28, 1914 in Galesburg, Illinois. he attended the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1937.Wilcke, Gerd. "Personality: Sociology-Oriented Executive; Borg-Warner Chief Pursues 2 Goals in His Activity R.S. Ingersoll Seeks Company's Growth and Democracy", The New York Times, June 20, 1965. Accessed August 28, 2010. After two years with the Armco Steel Corporation, he was hired in 1939 by his father's company, Ingersoll Steel and Disc Company. The company was a subsidiary of Borg-Warner, and he was named in 1942 as works manager of the firm's Kalamazoo, Michigan plant and as head of its Chicago plant in 1945, before being named as division vice president in 1947 and president in 1950 and then as Borg-Warner administrative vice president in 1953. Ingersoll was named in 1956 as the firm's president and chief operating officer, succeeding his father in the post.Raebum, Jean. "R.S. Ingersoll Replaces Father As President of Borg-Warner; PRESIDENT NAMED FOR BORG-WARNER", The New York Times, April 28, 1956. Accessed August 28, 2010. He was named as that firm's chairman and chief executive in 1961.Staff. "Ingersoll Passing Chairmanship To Son at Borg-Warner Corp.; CHAIRMAN NAMED BY BORG-WARNER", The New York Times, September 18, 1961. Accessed August 28, 2010. As CEO, Ingersoll was an active supporter of Urban League programs, supporting "better housing, economic opportunities and voting rights for the colored race" and noting that "our labor force will be increasingly Negro". By 1972, the firm did business in 22 countries around the world and had global sales of $1.15 billion. Shifting to foreign car companies as U.S. domestic manufacturers bought production in house, by 1971 Ingersoll saw automobile transmission sales increase more than tenfold to 487,000 units in the preceding decade.Hevesi, Dennis. "Robert Ingersoll, who Served as Envoy to Japan, Dies at 96", The New York Times, August 28, 2010. Accessed August 28, 2010.
Ingersoll's experience in dealing with business ventures in Japan played a major role in his choice by President Nixon as United States Ambassador to Japan in 1972, where he was only the second person who was not a career diplomat to be chosen in the period following World War II and the first businessperson to be selected. Ingersoll helped deal with differences between the nations regarding Japan's $3.5 billion trade surplus with the United States, negotiating agreements that led to Japanese imports in excess of $1 billion worth of American agricultural and manufactured products. In 1974, he was named as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and served in that post until 1976. After the Lockheed bribery scandals were disclosed to the public, Ingersoll played a lead role in the State Department's handling of the affair, which he stated had done "grievous damage" to U.S. foreign relations, with Lockheed having that Lockheed had paid $3 million in bribes to the office of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and more than $1 million in improper payments to Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The scandal led to the downfall of governments overseas and the resignations of two senior Lockheed officials.

[[Civil registry]]
CATEGORIES: Public records, Vital statistics, Genealogy, Government, Administrative law, Civil registries

Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database is called civil register or registry, or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create legal documents that are used to establish and protect the civil rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of any life event which affects the registry. The first nation to establish a nationwide register over its population was Sweden in 1631. This register was organized by the Church of Sweden but on the demand of The Crown.
The United Nations defines civil registration as "the continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population as provided through decree or regulation in accordance with the legal requirements of a country. Civil registration is carried out primarily for the purpose of establishing the legal documents provided by the law. These records are also a main source of vital statistics. Complete coverage, accuracy and timeliness of civil registration are essential for quality vital statistics.United Nations Statistics Division: Civil registration systems
Vital events that are typically recorded include live birth, death, foetal death, marriage, divorce, annulment of marriage, judicial separation of marriage, adoption, legitimization and recognition.United Nations Handbook on Training in Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems (PDF, 33.5MB) Among the legal documents that are derived from civil registration are birth certificates, death certificates, and marriage certificates. A family register is a type of civil register which is more concerned with events within the family unit and is common in Continental European and Asian countries, such as Germany ([tpl]lang|de|Familienbuch[/tpl]), France, Spain, Russia (Propiska), China (Hukou), Japan (Koseki), and North and South Korea (Hoju).
Additionally, in some countries, immigration, emigration, and any change of residence may require notification. A register of residents is a type of civil register primarily concerned with the current residence.

Compare this list to the provisions stocked by a modern cruise ship.
Foodstuffs may well be in the hold for months, perhaps years, and must have been unpalatable to say the least. Two hundred years ago life ashore was tough and life at sea had the advantage that at least you would get three meals a day however grim they may have been.

The Adelaide Rams were an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Adelaide, South Australia. The team was formed in 1995 for the planned rebel Super League competition, which eventually ran parallel to the rival Australian Rugby League (ARL) competition in 1997. The Rams lasted two seasons, the first in the Super League competition in 1997 and the second in the first season of the National Rugby League (NRL) in 1998. The Rams were not a successful club, winning only 13 out of 42 games. However crowd numbers in the first season were the fifth highest of any first-grade club that year, but dwindled to sixteenth in the second season. The Adelaide club was shut down at the end of the 1998 season as a result of poor on-field performances, dwindling crowd numbers, financial losses and a reduction in the number of teams in the NRL. They remain the only team from the state of South Australia to have participated in top-level rugby league in Australia.

The Xihoumen Bridge ([tpl]zh|s=西堠门大桥|t=西堠門大橋[/tpl]) is a suspension bridge built on the Zhoushan Archipelago, the largest offshore island group in China.  The main span was completed in December 2007.   The entire bridge, along with Jintang Bridge, was opened to traffic on a test basis on 25 December 2009. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iabse.ethz.ch/conferences/pdf/FI_Workshop_ChineseBridgeTour.pdf|title=IABSE Workshop 2009 with Chinese Bridge Tour - Recent Major Bridges][/tpl]  It is the second-longest suspension bridge ranked by the length of the centre span. The opening date was put off because of a ship collision on 16 November 2009 that slightly damaged the side of Jintang Bridge.
The 5.3-kilometre-long suspension bridge connection has a 2.6-kilometre-long main bridge with a central span of 1,650 metres. The approaches total 2.7 kilometres. When it opened, there was only one bridge with a larger span, the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan. However, there are several other bridges planned or under construction that will also be larger. 
The bridge was built by the province of Zhejiang, at a cost of 2.48 billion yuan (approximately US$363 million). Construction began in 2005, and the first traffic crossed the bridge on 25 December 2009, at 11:58 p.m., local time.
The Xihoumen Bridge links Jintang and Cezi islands. Another bridge, the 27-kilometer-long cable-stayed Jintang Bridge, links Jintang Island and Zhenhai of Ningbo.  The two bridges are the second phase of a huge project started in 1999 to link the Zhoushan Archipelago to the mainland with five bridges. Construction of the other three bridges has been completed.

[[Alloparenting]]
CATEGORIES: Parenting

In biology and sociology, alloparenting is a system of parenting in which individuals other than the actual parents act in a parental role.  
One common form of alloparenting is a situation in which grandparents adopt a parental role.  This is sometimes named a "skipped generation household".  In 1997, 8% of children in the United States lived with their grandparents, with the grandparents being the caregivers in one third of those cases.[tpl]ref|TRPER[/tpl]
According to Deihl[tpl]ref|Deihl[/tpl], the Efé people of Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo practice alloparenting, with care for infants coming from siblings, grandparents, and older members of the community.  Deihl states that where siblings are alloparents this provides adolescents experience of being a parent, and that similar practice in the United States would reduce the rate of teenage pregnancy and make teenage parents "better parents when they do become parents".
In biology, "Cooperatively breeding vertebrate systems are characterized by individual ‘helpers’ that take care of young ones within the social group that are not their own offspring — a behaviour termed ‘alloparental care’. In mammals, care typically encompasses allolactation, pup-feeding, babysitting and carrying young."[tpl]ref|Lewis-Pusey 1997[/tpl] An example of this in nature is when  male Barbary macaques carry around unrelated infants and care for them for hours at a time.  Small, Meredith F. "Alloparental Behaviour in Barbary Macaques, Macaca Sylvanus." Animal Behaviour 39.2 (1990): 297-306   Another example is when warthog sows suckle piglets from other litters after the sows have lost their own litters.Jensen, S.P., Siefert, L., Okori, J.J.L., Clutlon-Brock, T.H. (1999). "Age Related Participation in Allosucking by Nursing Warthogs."

Epsilon Geminorum (ε Gem, ε Geminorum) is a star in the constellation of Gemini.  It has the traditional name Mebsuta (also Melboula or Melucta). Epsilon Geminorum is located on the outstretched right "leg" of the twin Castor. The apparent visual magnitude of +3.06 makes it one of the brighter stars in this constellation.
The distance to this star can be determined directly using parallax measurements, yielding a value of [tpl]Convert|840|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl], although this result has a relatively large margin of error of [tpl]Convert|40|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off[/tpl]. Because Epsilon Geminorum is located near the ecliptic it can be occulted by the Moon or a planet. Just such an occultation  took place on April 8, 1976 by Mars, which allowed the oblateness of the planet's outer atmosphere to be measured. Prior to that, the star was occulted by Mercury on June 10, 1940.

Delta Geminorum (δ Gem, δ Geminorum) is a star in the constellation Gemini. It has the traditional name Wasat. The traditional name comes from the Arabic word for "middle". It has an apparent visual magnitude of +3.53, allowing it to be seen with the naked eye. Wasat is only two-tenths of a degree south of the ecliptic, and therefore is occasionally occulted by the Moon and, more rarely, by a planet. The last occultation by a planet was by Saturn on June 30, 1857, and the next will be by Venus on August 12, 2420.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In 1930, the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered about 0.5° to the east of this star by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh.

[[Lambda Sagittarii]]

CATEGORIES: Sagittarius (constellation), Bayer objects, K-type giants, Stars with proper names

Lambda Sagittarii (Lambda Sgr, λ Sagittarii, λ Sgr) is the Bayer designation for a star within the southern constellation of Sagittarius. The star marks the top of the Archer's bow, whence its traditional name Kaus Borealis. 
With an apparent visual magnitude of +2.82, this is one of the brighter members of the constellation and, accordingly to the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, it is readily visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of [tpl]Convert|78.2|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] from Earth. Being near the ecliptic, Lambda Sgr is sometimes occulted by the Moon and, more rarely, by a planet. The last planet to pass in front of it was Venus, on 19 November 1984. The previous occasion was on 5 December 1865, when it was occulted by the planet Mercury.
Kaus Borealis is a subgiant star with a stellar classification of K0 IV. It has a mass 2.6 times that of the Sun. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is [tpl]nowrap|4.24 ± 0.05 mas[/tpl]. At the estimated distance of Lambda Sagittarii, this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun. This expanded outer envelope is radiating energy at an effective temperature of 4,770 K, causing it to glow with the cool orange hue of a K-type star. It appears to be rotating at a leisurely rate, with a projected rotational velocity of [tpl]nowrap|3.81 km s–1[/tpl].

Electra, also cataloged as 17 Tauri, is a blue-white giant star in the constellation of Taurus. The star is one of the nine brightest stars in the Pleiades open cluster. The most visible stars in this group are named for the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology.
The star has an apparent brightness of 3.72, the third brightest of the stars in the group. Electra belongs to the spectral class B6 IIIe and is approximately 370 light years from the Sun. Electra is one of the four Pleiades stars that is classed as a giant; one that is starting to expand as the internal hydrogen fuel in the core is exhausted.
The projected rotational velocity of this star is 181 km/s, making it a fast rotator. This is the velocity component of the star's equatorial rotation along the line of sight to the Earth. The estimated inclination of the star's pole is [tpl]nowrap|46.8° ± 1.6[/tpl], giving it a true equatorial rotational velocity of [tpl]nowrap|320 ± 18 km/s[/tpl]. The rapid rotation rate of this star flattens the poles and stretch the equator. This makes the surface gravity of the star non-uniform and causes temperature variation. This effect is known as gravity darkening, because it results in a variation of radiation by latitude. The rapid rotation extends the life span of the star by increasing the core density and reducing the radiation output.
This is classified as a Be star, which is a B-type star with prominent emission lines of hydrogen in its spectrum.[ref]
</ref> The Be stars have a rotation rate that is 1.5–2 times the rotation of normal B-type stars. This high rate of rotation may allow mass loss during even minor prominences.<ref>
</ref> Changes in the [[radial velocity]] measurements indicate that this star may have a companion, which would make Electra a [[spectroscopic binary]].<ref>
[/ref][ref]
</ref>
Infrared observations of this star showed an excess level of radiation equal to about 0.5 magnitudes. This emission is probably from a gaseous disk created by radiation-driven mass loss and rapid rotation of the star. These disks are created by an ejection of material roughly every ten years, which then settles into the equatorial plane about the star. However, the bright nebulosity that surrounds this star makes the observation uncertain.[ref]
</ref>
Electra is periodically occulted by the Moon and occasionally by other planets in our solar system. The last planetary occultation took place on May 9, 1841, when it was occulted by Venus.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

Pi Sagittarii (Pi Sgr, π Sagittarii, π Sgr) is a triple star system in the zodiac constellation Sagittarius. It has the traditional name Albaldah.
Albaldah has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.89, which is sufficiently bright to be readily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of roughly [tpl]Convert|510|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] from Earth. Because it is close to the ecliptic, Albaldah can sometimes be occulted by the Moon, and, very rarely, planets of the Solar System. The next occultation by a planet takes place on February 17, 2035, when it will be occulted by Venus.
The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of F2 II. The 'II' luminosity class is for a bright giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has followed an evolutionary track away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. Because it has nearly six times the mass of the Sun, it reached this stage in a mere 67 million years. The outer envelope is radiating energy at an effective temperature of about 6,590 K, giving it the yellow-white hue of an F-type star.
Pi Sagittarii has two nearby companions. The first is located at an angular separation of 0.1 arcseconds from Albaldah, or at least 13 Astronomical Units (AU).  The second  is 0.4 arcseconds away, which is 40 AU or more. Nothing is known about the orbits of these stars.

[[Henry Shepherd Pearson]]

CATEGORIES: 1775 births, 1840 deaths, Governors of Penang, History of Penang, Year of birth uncertain

Henry Shepherd Pearson (c.1775-1840) was acting Governor of Penang from 1807 to 1808.
According to "The Worthies of Westmorland", by George Atkinson, Henry Shepherd Pearson was the second son of Sir Richard Pearson and Hannah Shepherd. He was christened at Saint Mary the Virgin in Dover, Kent on 8 February 1777. Another source holds that he was born in Dover on 20 October 1776, and that his mother was the former Margaret Harrison.Burke, John Bernard (ed.) (1848). The Patrician, Vol. VI, p. 407. London: E. Churton. In 1820 he married Caroline Lyons, daughter of John Lyons of Antigua and Catherine Walrond, and had the following children:
When Pearson was writing his will (held in National Archives, PROB 11/1931, Image Reference 227/203) in July 1839] he noted that he was "formerly of Bombay" but currently was "of Liverpool House, Dover" (actually Walmer, Kent) and was residing in Boulogne sur Mer, Kingdom of France. He continued to live in Boulogne sur Mer and was there when he wrote a final codicil to his will on 14 January 1840. In his will Pearson wrote that he wished to be buried where he died in the plainest manner possible. Evidence from the proving of his will on 28 July 1840 would suggest that he died in Boulogne sur Mer in mid July 1840 and is probably buried there. Another source gives his date of death as 13 April 1840.

Daughters of the Dust is a 1991 independent film written, directed and produced by Julie Dash; it is the first feature film by an African-American woman distributed theatrically in the United States. It tells the story of three generations of Gullah women in the Peazant family on St. Helena Island in 1902, as they prepare to migrate to the North.
Featuring an unusual narrative device, the film is told by the Unborn Child. Ancestors are part of the movie, as the Peazant family has lived on the island since their first people were brought as slaves centuries before. The movie gained critical praise, for its rich language and use of song, and lyrical use of visual imagery. It won awards at the Sundance Film Festival and others. 
The film features Cora Lee Day, Alva Rogers, Barbara-O, Turla Hoosier, Vertamae Grosvenor, and Kaycee Moore. It was filmed on Saint Helena Island in South Carolina.
In 2004, Daughters of the Dust was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Dash has published two books related to the film: Daughters of the Dust: The Making of an African-American Woman's Film (1992), which includes the screenplay; and Daughters of the Dust: A Novel (1997), set 20 years after the events in the film.

Laraaji (born 1943) is an American musician. Born Edward Larry Gordon in Philadelphia, he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey.  He attended Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. on a scholarship to study composition and piano.  After studying at Howard, he spent time in New York pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian and actor. 
In the early seventies he began to study Eastern mysticism and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life.  It was also at this time he bought his first zither from a local pawn shop.  Converting it to an electronic instrument, he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano.  By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin busking in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York.
The following year he was "discovered" by Brian Eno while playing in Washington Square Park.  The result was his most widely-recognized release, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance, the third installment of  Brian Eno's Ambient series.  This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji.
This international exposure led to many requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to many meditation groups on cassette tapes.  It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as Swami Satchidananda and Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati, founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.
Another product of Laraaji's increasing enlightenment was the creation of the Laughter Meditation Workshops which he still presents around the globe.

The foyer of the Metro, designed by leading Australian stage designer Brian Thomson, features a lightweight plastic replica of the Art Deco crystal chandelier which once hung in Regent Theatre which formerly stood opposite the Metro in George Street.
Acts who generally perform at the Metro usually are indie-rock and alternative bands, often of international fame. It was the venue for the now-legendary Sydney concerts in 1995 by Jeff Buckley and a record seven sold out shows in a row over six days in 1996 by You Am I,Escape artists among many others. 
It has two separate performance spaces inside the building, The Forum (often simply called The Metro) and The Transit Lounge (which, in January 2007, was re-launched and re-branded as The Lair). Up until 2007 it was not uncommon for both spaces to be used on the same night for different acts, with the larger of the two, the Forum, generally hosting the more famous act. Since the launch of the Lair the space has seldom been used for a public performance, as its primary function was to house MTV Australia's The Lair live music programme.
For a brief period in the second half of 2006 the venue was known as The Century Theatre after it went into receivership and was acquired by Century Venues. It was changed back to The Metro Theatre by October 2006.
On 16 September 2009 the Metro was rebranded as the Virgin Mobile Metro, after a sponsorship deal had been made. Dappled Cities Fly and the Seabellies both played at the launch night on 29 September 2009.

Measurements during the Hipparcos mission give the pair an angular separation of 0.46 arcseconds with a difference in magnitude of 2.0. At their estimated distance, this angle is equivalent to a physical separation of around 4 Astronomical Units. This pair may form an eclipsing binary system with a period of 785 days (2.15 years), resulting in a magnitude change of 0.12 during each eclipse.
The primary component has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.2, which by itself would still make it the third brightest star in the constellation. It is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. However, examination of the ultraviolet flux from this star suggests it may instead be of spectral type K7. The fainter secondary companion has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.1, which, if it were a solitary star, would be bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. This is a hot, core hydrogen-fusing B-type main sequence star of spectral class B2 Vp. The secondary may itself have an orbiting stellar companion of spectral class F8:.

[[Guru Nanak and the Sacred Thread]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu philosophical concepts, Sikh philosophical concepts

Guru Nanak and the Sacred Thread is a sacred story of Sikhism.
Hinduism is the total vedic, tantric, yogic and bhakti approach of Indian saints towards a final goal of immortality. Hinduism has two main concepts:
1. Nirguna brahman
2. Saguna brahman
Nirguna brahman has very spiritualistic prospect. It pertains to "nothingness" that pervades whole cosmos, which is beyond action and is true "self" in everyone.
Saguna brahman is defined as "everythingness". Saguna brahman is a concept that covers day to day actions, the holy/unholy rituals performed by humans are classified as Saguna brahman. These outer rituals are also directed towards the same goal of Nirguna brahman, that is, totality and final immortality. It is believed that all actions are covered with Maya (Maya is the deluding or illusive power of the world; illusion by which the world is seen as separate from the ultimate singular Reality) so is even a purest ritual. However it does not mean there is no bad or good action.
While the knowledge of Nirguna brahman is covered in Upanishads (all 108 upanishads), Gita (Avadhuta Gita, Ashtavakra Gita, Bhagavad Gita), Sutra (Narada Bhakti Sutra, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali), and Yoga Vasishta. There are other scriptures and smritis like ManuSmiriti, which cover how the knowledge of brahman reflects on day to day life i.e. Shaguna brahman.
Thread ceremony is a ritual, same as the fasting, having shaved head as in Jainism and some sects of Hindus. But time and time again, it has been watched that people often forget final goal of Nirguna brahman and fall prey to rituals. They start to confuse rituals as final goal, whereas rituals are not goals by themselves. These rituals on the might provide a direction and reminder to attain the ultimate goal, that too, if done with good intention and knowledge. Therefore saints have always been trying to put forward the real essence of spirituality so did Sri Guru Nanak Dev, his advice that, the ultimate is Nirguna brahman and all rituals no matter how advanced their effects are cannot are under influence of maya. In other words, rituals are not the ultimate goals by themselves, if one attaches itself too much with ritual ceremonies without being aware of their significance, will get diverted and lost in maya and will not be able to achieve the ultimate goal.
Guru Nanak Dev was not alone in making such announcements and shunning rituals, other saints also did the same from time to time:
1. Adi Shankaracharya (the sage of Kevala Advaita) refused to heed to the priests and offered ceremony of his dead mother himself. He said he is always pure atman so independent of action.
2. Baba Namdev refused to worship idol when he found out Shiva is essence of everything.
3. Tilopa Brahmin saint of Bengal highly adored by Tibetan Buddhism also stood against traditional ways of worshiping.
The following story describes the details of Guru Nanak Dev refusing to wear janeu, considered as a sacred thread as it reminded one of its duties. But people at the time were blind faithed so cared more about ceremonies and ritual attached with wearing janeu or janou rather than understanding the hidden message it bring and follow it.
When Guru Nanak attained the age of nine years, his father was determined to invest him with the janeu (sacrificial thread of the Hindus). Until a boy is invested with the janeu, he is deemed almost an outcast. When the members of the family had gathered, and all the neighbours, secular and religious, had assembled; and all preliminary rites had been duly performed, Hardial, the family priest, proceeded to put the sacred thread around Nanak's neck. The boy caught the thread with his hand, and asked the priest what he was doing, and the advantage of putting on the janeu. The priest explained that the janeu was the basis of the Hindu religion, without which a man would only be a Sudra (there are four great varans or castes of Hinduism: Brahmans, the priestly class; Kshatriyas, the military class; Vaisyas, the trading class; and Sudras, the working and lowest of all classes. There are many subdivisions of these castes ), and by putting it on he would obtain greatness in this life and happiness in the next. On hearing this the young Guru uttered the following:
From Asa ki Var:
The priest explained that the custom of wearing a janeu descended from the Vedic ritual, and that no Hindu could be deemed religious without wearing it. The Brahman then familiarly addressed the Guru, 'Thou art but a child of yesterday, and are we not as wise as thou? Unless thou wear this thread thou shalt be deemed a person without religion.' Guru Nanak replied:
The Brahman priest, on hearing this, became angry, and asked the Guru if everyone else was a fool, and he alone, who had abandoned the customs of his forefathers, was wise. He then asked the Guru to tell him what a proper janeu was. The Guru replied:
The Guru then wound up his instruction on the subject as follows:
Guru Nanak's reluctance was in participating in rituals which have no benefit and relevance in living a pure life. The Amrit Sanskar of Sikhi cannot be compared to the Janeu as 1) it is not a guarantee you will be able to live a spiritual life 2) it is open to all, from any gender and non-discrimnatory on caste lines. The Five Ks for the Khalsa are an assertion of sovereignty; they have little, if any, spiritual power. They are to be utilised in a Sikhs temporal life as commanded by Guru Gobind Singh.

The Coast Guards consisted the active-duty members of Pakistan Army and commanded by one-star rank Brigadier who is headquartered in Karachi, Sindh Province of Pakistan. The Coast Guard are charged and mandated with protecting the coastal areas of Balochistan and Sindh Province while it conducts military exercises and operations relating to riverine warfare. The Coast Guards should not be confused with the Maritime Security Agency (MSA) of the Pakistan Navy, which is by law and constitution, charged with defence of coastal areas of the country, conducting military operations to maintain maritime law enforcement in national and international waters.
The Coast Guards were first established as the Maritime Security Agency in 1971 and constituted operationally in 1972 through a Presidential Ordinance. The Parliament restored the constitutional status of the Branch after passing and promulgating the "Coast Guards Act" in 1973 and recognized as one of the six uniformed services of Paramilitary Command. Since then, it has upgraded its facilities and fleet to bolster its capabilities of littoral patrolling of the coast line. In addition to land based troops, the Coast Guards also maintains a small fleet of patrol boats to perform its sea-borne duties, although the operations in deep water and dangerous undertaking are conducted by its counterpart Maritime Security Agency (MSA) of Pakistan Navy. The exact number of personnel and equipment held with Coast Guards remains classified. The Pakistan Coast Guards works under administrative control of Ministry of Interior in peace time whereas it will come under operational control of Pakistan Army in wartime situations.

The literal translation of, (早熟) is "early maturity" and the English title, 2 Young, is a pun on the words "too young". The controversial topic of a pre-marital pregnancy of a minor is what the plot of 2 Young is framed around. Although the seriousness of the subject matter is woven throughout the film and is treated with respect, the overall objective of director, Derek Yee, was to keep the film light with moments of situational and appropriate humor.
2 Young stars Jaycee Chan and Fiona Sit with a supporting cast including Eric Tsang, Teresa Mo, Anthony Wong, and Candice Yu, who play the parents of Jaycee's and Fiona's characters respectively.

In 1901, Henry was appointed to the list of executioners after repeatedly writing to the Home Office to offer his services.

Pierrepoint later persuaded his elder brother Thomas to join the family business and influenced his son Albert to do the same. In his nine-year term of office Henry carried out 105 executions. His career was finished when he arrived the day before an execution at Chelmsford Prison "considerably the worse for drink", and fought his assistant John Ellis.

Thomas William Pierrepoint (1870–1954) was one of the United Kingdom's executioners from 1906 until 1946. He was the brother of Henry and uncle of Albert.A grisly family tradition. BBC Nottingham. Retrieved on 17 October 2009.
He was born in Sutton Bonington,1871 Census: Sutton Bonington; RG10; Piece 3259; Folio 92; Page 11. Nottinghamshire, the second child and eldest son of Thomas and Mary Pierrepoint. He worked as a hangman for 39 years until his mid-seventies in 1946. He is credited with having carried out 294 hangings in his career,[tpl]Harvnb|Fielding|2008|pp=288–294[/tpl] although no precise figure has been verified, as some of these were in Ireland. Among those he executed was the notorious poisoner Frederick Seddon in 1912. During World War II he was appointed as executioner by the US Military and was responsible for 13 out of 16 hangings of US soldiers at the Shepton Mallet military prison in Somerset. In this capacity Pierrepoint carried out executions not only for murder but also rape which at the time was a capital crime under US military law though not in British law, and in most cases he assisted by his nephew Albert who was, in turn, "Number One" for the remaining three executions.
In 1940, his medical fitness for the job was questioned by a Medical Officer who called him "unsecure" and doubted "whether his sight was good". The Prison Commission discreetly asked for reports on his performance during executions in the following time, but evidently found no reason to take action, although one report said that Thomas Pierrepoint had "smelled strongly of drink" on two occasions when reporting at the prison. This however appears to clash with Thomas Pierrepoint's instruction to Albert when the latter acted as his assistant not to take a drink if on the job, and never to accept the drink customarily given to all witnesses at executions in the Republic of Ireland.
Thomas never officially "retired", rather his name was removed from the list of executioners and invitations to conduct executions ceased to arrive.
Thomas died at the home of his daughter in Bradford on 11 February 1954, aged 84.[tpl]Harvnb|Fielding|2008|p=257[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Italian ballerinas, Ballet choreographers, Italian choreographers, 1850s births, 1930s deaths

Lucia Cormani was a 19th and early 20th-century Italian ballet dancer and one of the founders of the Royal Academy of Dance.
Lucia's life is not well documented, in part because she never danced in the most famous female roles. She was probably born about 1854 and died shortly after 1934. Her name appears on posters of ballet performances in Berlin, Brussels, St Petersburg, Guatemala, Boston (1883) and New York (1884). In 1889 she appeared as the Premiere Danseuse Assoluta in Cinderella; Or, Ladybird, Ladybird, Fly Away Home at Her Majesty's Theatre, London http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/cinder/cin8.htm and in 1900 she danced the role of Canio in a Metropolitan Opera production of Pagliacci (Philadelphia).http://frankhamilton.org/ph/ph0.pdf
Because of her tall muscular frame, Lucia was several times cast as a "travesty dancer" (a woman dressed as a man) -- for example as a male pirate chief in the ballet "Algeria" in 1887, and as a sorcerer in "Enchantment." Such roles were sometimes added for effect in ballets without being properly integrated into the plot.
Lucia's greatest success was as a choreographer from about 1893 to 1911. In 1903 she choreographed a production of Carmen for the Alhambra Theatre in London.  She also taught, using the stage of the Alhambra since she had no studio of her own. In 1920, she collaborated with four other great dancers -- Adeline Genée, Tamara Karsavina, Edouard Espinosa, and Phyllis Bedells—to form the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing, which was later to become the Royal Academy of Dance. Between them, the five represented the principal dance training methods of the time - Genée the Danish school, Karsavina the Russian school, Cormani the Italian school, Espinosa the French school, and Bedells the English school.  In 1923 the Association began a series of Annual Matinées; ten of Cormani's students participated in the premier performance, dancing a tarantella.
Her collected letters are in the London Theatre Museum and there are dozens of photographs of Cormani in the National Portrait Gallery.

The Swan River Colony, established in June 1829, was the only British colony in Australia established on the basis of land grants to settlers. Under the conditions stipulated by the Colonial Office, settlers would be granted land in proportion to the value of assets and labour that they brought to the colony. To ensure "productive" use of land, settlers were not given full title to their grants until they had been sufficiently "improved".  The system of land grants continued until 1832, after which crown land was disposed of by sale at auction.

Hospital San Juan de Dios is the name of several hospitals in the Republic of Colombia. The most important are located in Bogotá, Cúcuta and Pamplona.
The one located in Cúcuta is now a library.
The hospital of this name in Bogotá houses the National Institute of Immunology ([tpl]lang|es|Instituto Nacional de Inmunología[/tpl]) where important work on vaccines for malaria is carried out. This is one of the oldest serving hospitals in Latin America. It was founded in 1723. It initially consisted of three buildings of republican architectural style. The main building was modeled after the Pasteur Institute in France. A more modern high-rise building was constructed in the 1960s to house the hospital, and the original buildings were left unrepaired. Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo housed his lab ([tpl]lang|es|Instituto Colombiano de Immunología[/tpl]) in the old buildings, remodeling them to their initial architectural beauty. Patarroyo's lab was one of the leading institutes in the world working on a vaccine for malaria. 
The hospital remained one of the main academic medical centers until 1999 and was the main hospital for Colombia's state medical school ([tpl]lang|es|Universidad Nacional[/tpl]). The hospital was owned by a foundation, and after the restructuring of the medical system in Colombia to a universal private insurance capitated system, the hospital became financially insolvent because it stopped receiving direct state support. The bankruptcy of the hospital led to expropriation of its assets by lenders. All of the equipment of Patarroyo's lab was repossessed and the lab closed. Currently the hospital remains closed.

Brian Bromberg (born December 5, 1960 in Tucson, Arizona) is an American jazz bassist and record producer who performs on both electric and acoustic instruments. Though he tends to gravitate towards the genre of smooth jazz, Bromberg has released some straight-ahead jazz records in which he performs with a trio, and has even ventured into more rock oriented jazz fusion territory as of late. His innovative and technically demanding style of playing extends to both electric and upright bass. On his acoustic bass albums, Bromberg performs jazzy interpretations of various pop and rock staples from the 60s and 70s completely solo. Regarding his work with electric bass, Bromberg, among other bassists, helped popularize the piccolo bass, or bass with each string tuned an octave up, by releasing several albums in which he plays both the bass line and melody. For instance, upon first listen many will be surprised to learn that, although soaring guitar can be heard throughout the album, Bromberg's 2005 release Metal contains only Bromberg on two overdubbed basses, one of which is heavily effects-laden to make it sound like an electric guitar.

[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]
CATEGORIES: 1768 novels, British novels, Sentimental novels, Novels by Laurence Sterne

A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy is a novel by Laurence Sterne, written and first published in 1768, as Sterne was facing death. In 1765, Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples, and after returning determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view. The novel can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimental Travels through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modeled the character of Smelfungus on him.[tpl]cite book | title=The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2006|edition=3rd | pages=1124 | editor=Head, Dominic | work=Travels through France and Italy[/tpl]
The novel was extremely popular and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the second half of the 18th century. Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical learning and objective non-personal points of view, A Sentimental Journey emphasized the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments, of manners and morals over classical learning. Throughout the 1770s female travel writers began publishing significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts. Sentiment also became a favorite style among those expressing non-mainstream views including political radicalism.
The narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick, who is slyly represented to guileless readers as Sterne's barely disguised alter ego. The book recounts his various adventures, usually of the amorous type, in a series of self-contained episodes. The book is less eccentric and more elegant in style than Tristram Shandy and was better received by contemporary critics. It was published on 27 February, and on 18 March Sterne died.

[[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund]]
CATEGORIES: Economy of the European Union

The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are financial tools set up to implement the regional policy of the European Union. They aim to reduce regional disparities in terms of income, wealth and opportunities. Europe's poorer regions receive most of the support, but all European regions are eligible for funding under the policy's various funds and programmes. The current Regional Policy framework is set for a period of seven years, from 2007 to 2013.
The Structural Funds are made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). 
Together with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up the great bulk of EU funding, and the majority of total EU spending.
Apart from funds under the Cohesion policy, there are other funds that have the potential to contribute to the regional development. These are:
The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund make up one of the largest items of the budget of the European Union. 
It is up to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to define the tasks, priority objectives and the organisation of the Structural Funds (the Regional Policy framework), through the ordinary legislative procedure and consulting the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions (leading to the publication of Regulations). 
Sections below present information about objectives that have been defined for the current programming period, which runs from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The overall budget for this period is €347bn: €201bn for the European Regional Development Fund, €76bn for the European Social Fund, and €70bn for the Cohesion Fund.
The objectives setup shapes the main focus of interventions (eligible activities and costs) and the overall allocations of funds from the EU budget. 
The key indicator for the division of regions under singular objectives is the Gross National Product per capita (GNP p.c.) level. This is subject to criticism based on the fact that GDP p.c. is unable to reflect the real socio-economic reality of regions. Some groups (e.g. Beyond GDP) and organisations propose the creation of a set of alternative indicators that could substitute the GDP and its derivates.Beyond-GDP.eu

The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion is a small society of evangelical churches, founded in 1783 by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon as a result of the Evangelical Revival.  For years it was strongly associated with the Calvinist Methodist movement of George Whitefield.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Methodism[/tpl]
John Marrant (1755 – 1791), an ordained minister with the Connexion, was a noted evangelist amongst the Cherokee Native Americans and the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia, some of whom settled in Sierra Leone.
In the 1850s English-speaking Quebecer John Molson built a church for the group near his brewery in Montreal, but it was poorly attended and soon became a military barracks.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VIkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=66UFAAAAIBAJ&dq=bishop-fulford&pg=4431%2C2334187
Today the church has 21 congregations in England and some in Sierra Leone. Of the UK churches six normally have full-time pastors — Eastbourne, Ely, Goring, St. Ives, Turners Hill and Ebley. Total attendance at all churches is approximately 1,000 adults and children.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cofhconnexion.org.uk/churches/todays-churches/ |title=Today's Churches |publisher=Countess Of Huntingdons Connexion |accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl]

Joseph Canisius Kabui (1954 – 7 June 2008) was a secessionist leader and the first President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, off the coast of Papua New Guinea, from 2005 to 2008. He was also the leader of the Bougainville People's Congress."Bougainville president Kabui dies", theage.com.au, 7 June 2008.
Kabui was a commander in the Bougainville Revolutionary Army during the war in Bougainville in the 1990s. In June 2005, after the island gained autonomy within Papua New Guinea, he was elected as President of Bougainville by a large majority, winning 38,000 out of 69,385 votes. 
While in office, he granted a Canadian company, Invincible Resources, access rights to 70% of Bougainville's mineral resources, and he was widely criticized for this decision. This was announced in 2008 with no prior discussion in Parliament, and shortly before Kabui's death it was expected that a motion of no-confidence would be presented against him. In an interview shortly before his death, he said that his dream was "to see Bougainville become a Kuwait of the Pacific"."Bougainville Parliament at odds over resources deal", ABC News (Australia), 17 June 2008.
Kabui went to Brisbane for medical treatment prior to his sudden death on 7 June 2008 at a hospital in Buka. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Kabui a "skilled mediator and peacemaker who had a genuine interest in the future of his people", and according to Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith, Kabui played a "key role in restoring Bougainville to peace following the bitter conflict on the island"."Funeral for Bougainville leader", BBC News, 10 June 2008. A state funeral was held for Kabui"Papua New Guinea holds state funeral for president of autonomous Bougainville island", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 10 June 2008.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=40274 |title=Hundreds of mourners attend state funeral in Port Moresby for Joseph Kabui |date=10 June 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl]"Kabui couldn't afford medicine: reports", AAP (smh.com.au), 11 June 2008. at the St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Boroko in Port Moresby on 10 June. His body was returned to Buka on 11 June, and a funeral mass was held for him in Buka on 12 June. His body was planned to be taken to Arawa, Panguna, and finally the village of Padorima in Central Bougainville. The Bougainville government declared a public holiday to mourn Kabui."Bougainville mourns president Kabui", smh.com.au, 12 June 2008.
Kabui was believed to have died of a heart attack. In an interview with the Port-Courier, a newspaper in Papua New Guinea, that he gave 12 hours before his death, Kabui said that he had stopped taking his heart medicine four months beforehand and was taking a water tonic instead because the medicine was too expensive. He dismissed suggestions of seeking help, saying that "I am not a man that would ask for things that concern me", and he also said that he had missed a medical check-up because he was too busy with work. His next check-up was scheduled for later in June, but he noted that the necessary trip to Australia was expensive as well.
Vice-President John Tabinaman became Acting President following Kabui's death. The existing method for filling a vacancy in the presidency is to hold a new popular election, and Tabinaman described this as likely, while also noting the possibility of a constitutional amendment that would instead allow Parliament to elect one of its members as President.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=40403 |title=Bougainville constitution change mooted to choose Kabui successor |date=17 June 2008 |work=Radio New Zealand International |accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl] Planning for a new popular election subsequently began."PNG to fund Bougainville presidential election", ABC Radio Australia, 10 July 2008.

Epsilon Scorpii (ε Sco, ε Scorpii) is a star in the southern zodiac constellation of Scorpius. Patrick Moore introduced the name Wei but this seems to be a misreading; Wěi (尾), meaning the Tail, was originally the name of a Chinese asterism or Xiù comprising the stars ε, μ1-2, ζ1-2, η, θ, ι, κ, υ, and λ Scorpii.Ridpath, Ian, Tales''. This star has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.3, making it the fifth brightest member of the constellation. Parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission provide an estimated distance to this star of around [tpl]Convert|63.7|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl].
Epsilon Scorpii has a stellar classification of K1 III, which indicates it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved into a giant star. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is [tpl]nowrap|5.99 ± 0.06 mas[/tpl], which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of nearly 13 times the radius of the Sun. Presently it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of helium at its core, which, considering the star's composition, places it along an evolutionary branch termed the red clump. The star's outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 4,560 K, giving it the orange hue of a cool K-type star. It is classified as a variable star, although it only varies by around 0.01–0.02 magnitudes. Epsilon Scorpii is an X-ray source with a luminosity of [tpl]nowrap|(1.5–1.6) × 1027 erg s–1[/tpl].

James Glynn (1800–1871) was a U.S. Navy officer who in 1848 distinguished himself by being the first American to negotiate successfully with the Japanese during the "Closed Country" period.
James Glynn entered the United States Navy on March 4, 1815.  He became a lieutenant in 1825, a commander in 1841, and served on the California coast during the Mexican-American War.  He was put in command of the sloop-of-war USS Preble (16 guns) and sent to China. 
In Canton, he learnt from the Dutch consul about the imprisonment at Nagasaki of 18 American sailors from the whaleship Lagoda, who had been shipwrecked on the northern Japanese island of Yeso on June 5, 1846.  Although the coast of Japan was poorly known, and the American Commander James Biddle, with the ships USS Columbus and USS Vincennes had been recently repelled by the Japanese in the bay of Edo (Tokyo), Glynn was ordered by David Geisinger to leave for Nagasaki, where he arrived on April 17, 1849. 
The sailing orders to Captain Glynn recommended both caution and firmness in his enterprise:
The Japanese tried to block the entrance to Glynn's ship, but he forced his way through a row of boats and anchored in the middle of the bay of Nagasaki.  Despite Japanese menaces, he insistently demanded the release of the prisoners, and threatened an intervention of the United States.  With some help from the Dutch in the negotiations, the prisoners were finally delivered to him on April 26.
The sailors had suffered throughout their internment, and after several attempts to escape were put in cages where several died of exposure.  Another had hanged himself, and was left hanging in his cage for two days.  Ranald MacDonald was also among the party of the rescued, although he had travelled to Japan of his own will and taught English to several Japanese during his internment in Nagasaki, becoming the first American to teach English in Japan.
The Preble returned to Hong Kong and the prisoners finally returned to the United States on December 31, 1849, where the story of their harsh internment made a sensation.
Following his voyage, Glynn made a proposition to the United States government to open relations with Japan through diplomacy, and, if necessary, by a show of strength.  His recommendation paved the way for the expedition of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 and 1854.
Glynn was made a captain in 1855.

[tpl]Other uses|Officium (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Officium[/tpl]
Officium (plural officia) is a Latin word with various meanings in Ancient Rome, including "service", "(sense of) duty", "courtesy", "ceremony" and the like. It also translates the Greek kathekon and was used in later Latin to render more modern offices.
However, this article is mainly concerned with the meaning of "an office" (the modern word office derives from it) or "bureau" in the sense of a dignitary's staff of administrative and other collaborators, each of whom was called an officialis (hence the modern official).
The Notitia Dignitatum gives us uniquely detailed information, stemming from the very imperial chanceries, on the composition of the officia of many of the leading court, provincial, military and certain other officials of the two Roman empires c. AD 400. While the details vary somewhat according to rank, from West (Rome) to East (Byzantium) and/or in particular cases, in general the leading staff would be about as follows (the English descriptions and other modern "equivalents" are approximate):
Below those "dignities", there were often a few hundred minor officials, often slaves or freedmen, doing the clerical drudgery, not deemed worthy of any more detailed mention. They are only referred to collectively, by various terms in the plural, such as cohortalini (apparently the diminutive of cohortalis, the very term suggesting significant number; see cohors amicorum).

[[Anaplerotic reactions]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration

Anaplerotic reactions (from the Greek ἀνά= 'up' and πληρόω= 'to fill') are those that form intermediates of a metabolic pathway. Examples of such are found in the Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) Cycle (also called the Krebs or citric acid cycle). In normal function of this cycle for respiration, concentrations of TCA intermediates remain constant; however, many biosynthetic reactions also use these molecules as a substrate. Anaplerosis is the act of replenishing TCA cycle intermediates that have been extracted for biosynthesis (in what are called cataplerotic reactions).
The TCA Cycle is a hub of metabolism, with central importance in both energy production and biosynthesis. Therefore, it is crucial for the cell to regulate concentrations of TCA Cycle metabolites in the mitochondria. Anaplerotic flux must balance cataplerotic flux in order to retain homeostasis of cellular metabolism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Owen O, Kalhan S, Hanson R |title=The key role of anaplerosis and cataplerosis for citric acid cycle function |journal=J.

[[Clear-air turbulence]]
CATEGORIES: Atmospheric dynamics, Weather hazards to aircraft, Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena, Turbulence, Wind

Clear-air turbulence (CAT) is the turbulent movement of air masses in the absence of any visual cues such as clouds, and is caused when bodies of air moving at widely different speeds meet.Stull, B. R., 1988 An introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology, Kluwert Academic Publishers 666 pp.
The atmospheric region most susceptible to CAT is the high troposphere at altitudes of around [tpl]convert|7000|-|12000|m|ft[/tpl] as it meets the tropopause. Here CAT is most frequently encountered in the regions of jet streams. At lower altitudes it may also occur near mountain ranges. Thin cirrus cloud can also indicate high probability of CAT.
CAT can be hazardous to the comfort, and even safety, of air travel.  An increase in clear-air turbulence is an expected effect of global warming.  In the journal Nature Climate Change Paul Williams of the University of Reading and Manoj Joshi of the University of East Anglia reported moderate to severe transatlantic turbulence would be 40 to 170 percent more frequent in a world that had twice as much atmospheric carbon dioxide as pre-industrial times did.[tpl]doi|10.1038/nclimate1866[/tpl]Rising carbon dioxide means more air turbulence April 8, 2013 Vol.183 #9 Science NewsClimate Change Could Equal Teeth-Rattling Flights April 08, 2013 NPRWarming Planet Means Bumpier Flights; "Climate models and turbulence algorithms forecast that, by mid-century, clear-air turbulence will be more violent and transatlantic flights will hit it twice as often"  April 8, 2013 Scientific American Transatlantic flights 'to get more turbulent 8 April 2013 BBC

S6. was a Scottish-Canadian musician, best known as a member of the multi-platinum selling band Platinum Blonde.
MacLean was born in Glasgow. A former hairdresser, he was a member of the group The Hairdressers, and then was a founding member of The Suspects in 1979. That band changed its name to The Deserters in 1981, and released two albums, The Deserters and Siberian Nightlife.MacNeil, Jason. "MacLean died of 'natural causes'", Sun Media, 2008-11-24.

MacLean was bassist and keyboardist, and songwriter for some songs, on their 1985 album Alien Shores. He was also part of the band for Contact in 1987, and for their 1990 album Yeah Yeah Yeah, when the band was renamed The Blondes. MacLean then released two solo albums in the 1990s, without the backing of major-label financing. In 1990, his solo debut Don't Look Back was released on a new label, Justin,Mayes, Alison.

MacLean created the music company hMh Music, and was its artistic director. An academy officially opened in Toronto on September 2, 2008, and featured programs such as audio engineering and DJ arts.
MacLean had a big influence in getting Platinum Blonde back together after a 20-year absence, but he wouldn't live to see it come to fruition.  MacLean had commented to Platinum Blonde's lead singer Mark Holmes “hundreds of times” that Platinum Blonde should re-unite. Holmes once quoted MacLean as saying, “Let’s get back together. Music doesn't have any rock stars anymore.” In November 2008, Holmes took up MacLean's long-standing offer to make a guest appearance at one of his shows at the Mod Club in Toronto, a club founded by Holmes, and they performed a collection of Platinum Blonde hits.
MacLean was found dead on November 24, 2008 of a heart related problem, around three hours after the show with Mark Holmes.Askew, Stacey.

Until 1 January 2007, Ebeltoft municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in Aarhus County on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula in central Denmark.  The region lies in a geographic region known as southern Djursland, and more specifically Mols.  The municipality covered an area of 276 km², and had a total population of 14.997 (2005).

[[The Dancers at the End of Time]]

CATEGORIES: Novels by Michael Moorcock, Science fiction book series, Time travel literature, Dying Earth subgenre

The Dancers at the End of Time is a series of science fiction novels and short stories written by Michael Moorcock, the setting of which is the End of Time, an era "where entropy is king and the universe has begun collapsing upon itself".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scwu.com/bookreviews/h/MoorcockMichaelDancersattheEndofTimeThe.shtml|author=Steven Wu|title="Dancers at the End of Time, The", review|accessdate=13 April 2006[/tpl] The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, who create flights of fancy using power rings which draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. Space travellers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clichéd. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th Century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in The End of All Songs.Omnibus edition, Granada. [tpl]cite book|title=The End of All Songs|quote=So shall they dance, until the end of time|page=650[/tpl]  "Ernest Wheldrake" had been a pseudonym used by Algernon Charles Swinburne.Edmund Gosse, The Life of Algernon Swinburne (1917), p44.
The original trilogy (An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands, and The End of All Songs) was published between 1972 and 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.co.uk/sweetdespise/moorcock/bib/|accessdate=13 April 2006|title=Bibliography of works by Michael Moorcock|author=Ian Davey[/tpl] The trilogy purports to tell the last love story in human history. Other stories in this sequence include The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming (also known as A Messiah at the End of Time) which is a rewrite of the novella Constant Fire. Several short stories, some of which were included in the collection Legends from the End of Time, were published in New Worlds 7–10 (the paperback revival of the magazine). Short stories featuring Elric ("Elric at the End of Time"), and Jerry Cornelius ("The Murderer's Song") also feature characters and places from the End of Time.
Main characters in the series include Jherek Carnelian, one of the few humans at the End of Time to have been born naturally, rather than created; Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from the late 19th century; the enigmatic Lord Jagged; and Miss Mavis Ming in the eponymous The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming, which also features the Fireclown. (The 1993 Millennium omnibus edition of Legends from the End of Time ostensibly assembles all the stories and The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming – under the title Constant Fire – but was affected by severe printing errors and omits the final six lines of Elric at the End of Time and all but the final chapter of Constant Fire. These were corrected for the 1997 Orion edition.)

Alfred Hamish Reed [tpl]post-nominals|country=NZL-cats|Kt.|CBE[/tpl]  (1875-1975) was a New Zealand publisher, author and entrepreneur.  A. H. Reed was born at Hayes, Middlesex, England, on 30 December 1875, the son of James William Reed and Elizabeth Reed.  He migrated to New Zealand with his parents in 1887. After some experience in Northland as a kauri gum-digger, he moved to Dunedin where, in 1897, he became manager of the Typewriter Co. An early childhood leg problem denied him access to active duty during World War I, and he was retained at an army base as a clerk due to his shorthand skills. He entered the bookselling trade when he founded the firm of A. H. and A. W. Reed, a leading publisher of New Zealand-related non-fiction and reference works, in association with his nephew Alexander Wyclif Reed. In 1932, he branched out as a publisher and in 1935 he became an author.
Reed also undertook walking and mountain-climbing expeditions. He climbed Mount Taranaki/Egmont (aged 80), Mount Ruapehu (aged 83), Ngauruhoe (aged 85), walked from North Cape to Bluff, now known as the Te Araroa Trail (aged 85) and from East Cape to Cape Egmont (aged 86), walked through Marlborough (aged 87) and through Otago, Canterbury, Westland, and the Haast (aged 88).
In 1938 Reed and his wife established the Alfred and Isabel and Marian Reed Trust for the promotion of Christianity, education, literature and philanthropy for the people of New Zealand. The trust has amassed a collection of rare books and manuscripts for the Dunedin Public Libraries, including one of the most comprehensive collections of manuscripts and early printed Bibles in the Southern Hemisphere.
The A. H. Reed Memorial Kauri Park Scenic Reserve, near Whangarei, commemorates his association with the district.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.planmyplay.co.nz/play/whangarei-ah-reed-memorial-kauri-park-whangarei-falls | title=AH Reed Memorial Kauri Park | work=Plan My Play | date=Oct 24, 2011 | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | author=Julie Crean (Editor)[/tpl]

Delta Ursae Majoris (Delta UMa, δ Ursae Majoris, δ UMa) is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It has the traditional names Megrez [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|ɡ|r|ɛ|z[/tpl], and Kaffa. Megrez has an apparent magnitude of +3.3, making it the dimmest of the seven stars in the Big Dipper asterism. Parallax measurements yield a distance estimate of [tpl]Convert|58.4|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on[/tpl] from Earth.
Megrez has 63% more mass of the Sun and is about 1.4 times the Sun's radius. It has a stellar classification of A3 V, which means it is an A-type main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. It shines at 14 times the luminosity of the Sun, with this energy being emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 9,480 K. This gives it the white hue typical of an A-type star.
This star has an excess emission of infrared radiation, indicating the presence of circumstellar matter. This forms a debris disk around an orbital radius of 16 Astronomical Units from the star. This radius is unusually small for the estimated age of the disk, which may be explained by drag from the Poynting–Robertson effect causing the dust to spiral inward.
It has two faint companions, an 11th magnitude star at an angular separation of 190 arcseconds, and a 10th magnitude star 186 arcseconds away.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Megrez is a marginally outlying member of the Ursa Major moving group, an association of stars that share a common motion through space and likely formed in the same molecular cloud. The space velocity components of Delta Ursae Majoris in the galactic coordinate system are V, W = +1.17, –11.52[tpl]nowrap| km s–1[/tpl].

Each NECBL team plays an eight-week, 44-game schedule during June and July, with a playoff in early August.  Like the Cape Cod Baseball League and other amateur leagues, the NECBL is a showcase for top college-level players, giving professional baseball scouts a chance to see prospective pros playing against each other.

Chlorocruorin is an oxygen-binding hemeprotein present in the blood plasma of many annelids, particularly certain marine polychaetes. Its affinity for oxygen is weaker than that of most haemoglobins. A dichromatic compound, chlorocruorin is noted for appearing green in dilute solutions, though it appears light red when found in concentrated solutions.
Its structure is very similar to erythrocruorin (which is likewise very similar to multiple subunits of myoglobin) and it contains many 16-17kDa myoglobin-like subunits arranged in a giant complex of over a hundred subunits with interlinking proteins as well with a total weight exceeding 3600kDa. The only significant difference between chlorocruorin and erythrocruorin is that chlorocruorin carries an abnormal heme group structure.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Pallavicini A, Negrisolo E, Barbato R, et al. |title=The primary structure of globin and linker chains from the chlorocruorin of the polychaete Sabella spallanzanii |journal=J.

[[Truck Festival]]

CATEGORIES: Music festivals in Oxfordshire, Recurring events established in 1998, 1998 establishments in England, Annual events in the United Kingdom

Truck Festival is an annual independent music festival in Oxfordshire, England. It was started in 1998 by the Bennett family (including the brothers Robin and Joe of the band Goldrush), who decided that mainstream festivals such as Glastonbury had become too commercial and predictable. It is held in July at Hill Farm in Steventon, near Abingdon-on-Thames. The festival also gave birth to the Truck Records label in 1999.
The main stage is constructed from three large flatbed trucks, and a common misperception is that this is where the name of the festival comes from. However in 2007 Robin Bennett wrote on the official Truck website: "Contrary to popular belief, the name Truck actually came from a compilation CD I picked up, 'Ten Trucking Greats', the soundtrack of the movie Convoy."This Is Truck website - About the Festival
Truck has grown somewhat since its inception, but with an annual attendance of around 5,000 it is dwarfed by the likes of Glastonbury (around 150,000 people) and Reading/Leeds. Part of Truck's appeal for fans is that it can be viewed as a microcosm of these larger festivals, with a similar layout and facilities but on a more manageable scale. Due to a variety of factors, chiefly the layout of Hill Farm, it is highly unlikely that Truck has any potential for significant growth in the near future.
Hill Farm remains very much a working farm, shutting down only temporarily to allow the festival to take place each year. One of Truck's six stages is the so-called "Barn That Cannot Be Named"—a cow-shed with a stage set up at one end—which, despite the rich smell of manure, remains an ever-popular place to watch bands at the festival. The Barn mainly plays host to metal, emo, hardcore and punk acts during the day, then on Saturday evening turns into an arena for drum and bass and other dance music, returning to its rock incarnation on Sunday.
Other stages include Trailer Park (renamed The Village Pub in 2008), a marquee in the main arena which features the more esoteric indie bands during the day, and breakbeat on Saturday night; the Lounge (renamed the Beat Hive in 2008), a smaller marquee which used to specialise in more ambient and chilled performances during the day, and trance during the night but now plays host to a number of local, national, and international bands and DJs as well as a range of electronic music; the Market tent, which is set in the market area a short walk from the main field and features mainly folk-oriented music, becoming a retro disco/karaoke venue on Saturday night; and the Theatre/Fringe tent (renamed the Pavilion in 2008), which hosts non-musical acts such as theatrical performances, stand-up comedy, performance art and spoken-word performers.
The festival prides itself on its family atmosphere, with all of the site services being provided by local groups: the food stall is run by the local Rotary Club, and ice cream is sold by the local vicar. All profits from the festival go to charity.
A compilation album is released each year on Truck Records to coincide with the festival, featuring tracks (mainly studio recordings) from various bands playing at the festival.
A number of sister festivals have been launched in recent years. The annual Wood festival, at Braziers Park in Oxfordshire, was first held in 2008 and is run with an emphasis on the environment. EquiTruck has been held in January every year since 2006,BBC - Oxford - Entertainment - Equitruck at the midpoint between Truck Festivals, and is run by the Truck Festival bar staff. UniTruck was created out of the abandoned 2007 Truck Festival, which had to be moved to Oxford Brookes University at short notice. The first two festivals (in July and November 2007) were held at Oxford Brookes, followed by an event in December 2007 at Bucks New University in High Wycombe, which has become an annual event (now in November). Truck America was launched in April 2010, at the Full Moon Resort in New York.Truck America
After a difficult 2011, with poor ticket sales threatening the future of the festival, Robin and Joe Bennett announced they would be stepping down. The festival continued in 2012 under the management of the Y Not Festival and the event was sold out.Hughes, Tim.

Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah or 'Sultan Sir Abdu'l Hamid Halim Shah II ibni Ahmad Taj ud-din al-Mukarram Shah [tpl]Abbr|KCMG|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George[/tpl], (4 June 1864 – 13 May 1943) was the 25th Sultan of Kedah. He reigned from 1881 to 1943. He was the son of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Mukarram Shah and Wan Hajar.
During his reign, the Sultan had asked for a $2,500,000 loan from Siam during a state financial crisis in 1905. The loan was extended with the proviso that a Financial Advisor from the court of Siam be accepted and a State Council be created to assist the Sultan in the administration of all public affairs. This resulted in the promulgation of a new constitution on 29 July 1905. The state council were run by his brothers followed by their sons. The formation of the State Council thus curbed the Sultan's administrative powers.
The Sultan had several wives and partners; Che Manjelara, Che Sofiah, Sharifah Fatimah Binti Syed Idrus, Sharifah Seha Binti Syed Hussein, Che Spachendra, Sharifah Mariam and Che Laraseh. The Sultan's seventh son and twentieth child with Makche Manjelara, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who would later became the first Prime Minister of Malaysia.
He was succeeded by Sultan Badlishah.

SX-Windows was a non-preemptive multitasking operating system, using the event driven paradigm. It runs on top of the Human 68k DOS operating system which resembled MS-DOS—it is very similar to the relationship between Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS.
SX-Window was a standard window system for Sharp Corporation's X68000 series in Japan. It was introduced for X68000 in 1989, and came preinstalled on the X68000 EXPERT model. It was developed by Hudson. The look and feel of the GUI is like NeXT, and its API is similar Macintosh Programmer's Toolkit. It has a garbage collection system without MMU unit of MPU, but it's difficult to program because all pointers derived from handles become invalid once any API is called. X68000 was very powerful for game software, but this GUI was very slow as no hardware acceleration card was supported for this window system. Only few applications and games were developed for this system. Final version number is 3.1.

Humor Risk (1921) was the first Marx Brothers film. The short film was never released and is now considered a lost film. The print may have been accidentally thrown away when left in the screening box overnight.Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers (Hardcover), Simon Louvish. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition (2000). Another version of the story says Groucho, unhappy with the film's quality, intentionally burned the negative after a particularly bad premiere screening.
Four of the five Marx Brothers are known to have been in this short film. It was directed by comedy film director Dick Smith (1886-1937), and was the first film written by Jo Swerling, who later co-wrote It's a Wonderful Life, Gone with the Wind and many other films. Jobyna Ralston is most often mentioned as the female lead. However, some sources say that Mildred Davis—star and later wife of Harold Lloyd—was also in the film. The Marxology entry for Humor Risk and the SilentEra entry state that the leading lady could have been one of two other actresses, Esther Ralston or Helen Kane.SilentEra entry

[[Zemirot]]

CATEGORIES: Jewish liturgical poems, Hebrew words and phrases, Hebrew-language songs, Shabbat, Jewish music, Religious music, Vocal music

Zemirot or Z'mirot ([tpl]lang-he|זמירות[/tpl]) (Yiddish: Zmiros; Biblical Hebrew: Z'miroth; singular: zemer/z'mer) are Jewish hymns, usually sung in the Hebrew or Aramaic languages, but sometimes also in Yiddish or Ladino.  The best known zemirot are those sung around the table during Shabbat and Jewish holidays.  Some of the Sabbath zemirot are specific to certain times of the day, such those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon.  In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook (siddur), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer (kiddush) for each meal.  Other zemirot are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.
The words to many zemirot are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the Middle Ages.  Others are anonymous folk songs that have been passed down from generation to generation.  The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.
The melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems. One famous hymn, Adon Olam, (Ruler of the Universe) has been set to literally hundreds of different tunes.  Jews of different backgrounds enjoy sharing the various versions when they meet around the Sabbath table.   New tunes continue to be written today for the same ancient lyrics. It is now rare, however, for new zemer-type lyrics to be written.
The term zemirot is used by Spanish and Portuguese Jews to refer to the sequence of psalms in the morning service, known to other communities as pesuke de-zimrah.

[[How Important Can It Be?]]

CATEGORIES: 1955 singles, Songs written by Bennie Benjamin, Songs written by George David Weiss, 1955 songs

"How Important Can It Be?" is a popular song written by Bennie Benjamin and George David Weiss and published in 1955. The lyrics of the song find the narrator asking her lover why her indiscretions with other boyfriends before him matter at all, now that she loves him so and vows to be true to him.
It was popularized in 1955 by Joni James. It was again recorded and popularized by rockabilly artist Wanda Jackson in 1962. There is also a successful recording of this song by Sarah Vaughan. 
The versions by James and Jackson, though short pieces at 2 minutes and 30 seconds, are classic and timeless, and capture the emotion of the singer.
The 1950s version by Joni James was used in the popular Academy Award-winning motion picture LA Confidential.
The song was first presented to James by the music publisher Tommy Valando, according to her international fan club president Wayne Brasler of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. James recorded it at her first session in New York City, after moving from her hometown of Chicago, with arranger David Terry. However, after listening to the playback she and her career director and future husband Tony Acquaviva felt, in her words, "something was missing." She came up with the idea of a shuffle beat and male chorus in the style of The Four Aces, and planned to redo the song at her next session. 
Meanwhile, Sarah Vaughan recorded the song, then Teresa Brewer, then Lou Monte. The Vaughan version was just about to come out when James recorded her second version, which MGM Records rush-released, stepping on a James hit headed up the charts to number one, "When We Come of Age". The label tried promoting both singles, but "Important" quickly overshadowed "Age". Beyond that distraction, the flip side of "Important", the lush ballad "This Is My Confession" got big radio and jukebox play.

"I Don't See Me in Your Eyes Anymore" is a popular song, written by Bennie Benjamin and George David Weiss and published in 1949. The song was popularized that year by Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra (vocals by The Stardusters) and by Perry Como.
The song received renewed popularity in 1974, when country singer Charlie Rich released a cover version he had recorded during the mid-1960s. Rich's rendition reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in June 1974, crossing the Top 50 Of the "Hot 100" survey and peaking in the top ten of the "Easy Listening" chart.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

[[Electoral division of Casuarina]]

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of the Northern Territory

Casuarina is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. It was first created in 1974 and was named after the adjacent suburb of Casuarina. Casuarina is an entirely urban electorate, covering only 18 km² and taking in the suburbs of Brinkin, Nakara, Tiwi and part of Alawa, as well as the Charles Darwin University. There were 5,031 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012.
For the first three decades of its existence, Casuarina, like most seats in the Darwin area, was a stronghold for the Country Liberal Party. Clare Martin did nearly manage to take the seat for the Australian Labor Party upon the retirement of long-serving CLP member Nick Dondas in 1994, but lost out to the CLP's Peter Adamson, who held the seat for the next seven years. It was still widely presumed to be a safe Liberal seat in 2001, when it fell to the ALP in one of the most surprising results of the 2001 election. The seat appears to now be a safe Labor seat, as Vatskalis easily held the seat at the 2005 election with a massive swing in his favour and easily retained it in 2008 and 2012.

Peter Heywood (6 June 1772 – 10 February 1831) was a British naval officer who was on board [tpl]HMS|Bounty[/tpl] during the mutiny of 28 April 1789. He was later captured in Tahiti, tried and condemned to death as a mutineer, but subsequently pardoned. He resumed his naval career and eventually retired with the rank of post-captain, after 29 years of honourable service.
The son of a prominent Isle of Man family with strong naval connections, Heywood joined Bounty under Lieutenant William Bligh at the age of 15 and, although unranked was given the privileges of a junior officer. Bounty left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit from the Pacific, and arrived in Tahiti late in 1788. Relations between Bligh and certain of his officers, notably Fletcher Christian, became strained, and worsened during the five months that Bounty remained in Tahiti.
Shortly after the ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented followers seized Bligh and took control of the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were captured in Tahiti by the search vessel [tpl]HMS|Pandora|1779|6[/tpl], and held in irons for transportation to England. The subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive.
In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed and with five others was sentenced to hang. However, the court recommended mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command at the age of 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.

The Estadio Azul, is a 35,000-seat stadium located in Mexico City. This sports facility is currently used for association football matches and previously (until 1990) for American football. It is the home of Mexican football club Cruz Azul; it has been also home for Atlante F.C. (hence the nickname Estadio Azulgrana) and several home matches of the Mexico national football team, especially in the early 1990s.
Both times when Mexico hosted the World Cup, Estadio Azul did not host any games mainly due to the age of the structure, the bad parking facilities and the complex traffic patterns.
A peculiarity of this stadium is that it is built as a pit; the playing field is below street level. Another oddity is that just beside the stadium is the Plaza México, the world's largest bullring.

A rough translation of these lyrics in English is as follows:
From the vine came the grape, from the grape came the wine, from the wine a dream of love,
I am dreaming of returning with you, Maria close to your heart,
We see the life of my Maria, more beautiful eyes do not exist,

He was involved with improvements to the Shire Hall in Monmouth under "Royal assent" where he and Edward Haycock made the building extend down Agincourt Street creating room for a new staircase and larger courts. Hopper took up residence in Monnow Street in Monmouth whilst this was happening.
In 1840 he exhibited designs for Butterton Hall in Staffordshire.

Commander Thomas Hayward (1767-1798?) was a British sailor who was present during the Mutiny on the Bounty. He was born in Hackney, where his father was a minor official.
Hayward's oldest sister, Ann, was a close friend of Betsy Betham, who married William Bligh. Through Betsy, Hayward managed to obtain a position as a midshipman on the Bounty. His service on the Bounty seems to have been lacklustre, but he remained loyal to Bligh and a staunch opponent of Fletcher Christian, who disliked him immensely.  He was the second person ordered into the boat carrying the loyalists, the first being Bligh himself. Heywood also disliked Hayward, calling him a 'worldling', raised a little in society, as a result of which he typically affected airs and graces beyond his station.
Upon returning to England with Bligh, Hayward set out as third lieutenant under Captain Edward Edwards on [tpl]HMS|Pandora|1779|6[/tpl]. Although they succeeded in finding some of the mutineers on Tahiti, and Hayward evidently performed well, it was an unfortunate voyage, ending with Pandora shipwrecked, and for the second time in as many years Hayward found himself without a ship, in an open boat making for safety.  He eventually returned to England with other survivors from the Pandora, after which his career is uncertain. It has been suggested, based mainly on nearly illegible papers, that Hayward commanded HM Sloop Swift.  If so, he drowned when the ship was lost with all hands in a typhoon in the South China Sea in 1798.
Hayward is frequently confused with Peter Heywood -a fellow Bounty midshipman- because of the their similar sounding names; for instance, in the 1984 de Laurentiis The Bounty film, Hayward was characterized as one of the mutineers who decided to stay at Tahiti.

Founded perhaps as early as 1780, the Bullingdon was originally a sporting club, dedicated to cricket and horse-racing, although dinners gradually became its principal activity.

The Primera Junta or First Assembly is the most common name given to the first independent government of Argentina. It was created on 25 May 1810, as a result of the events of the May Revolution. The Junta initially had representatives from only Buenos Aires. When it was expanded, as expected, with the addition of the representatives from the other cities of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, it became popularly known instead as the Junta Grande (Grand Council). The Junta operated at El Fuerte (the fort, where the modern Casa Rosada stands), which had been used since 1776 as a residence by the Viceroys.

[[Darwin's tubercle]]

CATEGORIES: Ear, Human anatomy

Darwin's tubercle is a congenital ear condition which often presents as a thickening on the helix at the junction of the upper and middle thirds. The feature is present in approximately 10.4% of the population.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=A. |title=An anthropometric study of the ear in an adult population |journal=International Journal of Anthropology |volume=1 |pages=135–43 |year=1986 |doi=10.1007/BF02447350 |issue=2[/tpl] This acuminate nodule represents the point of the mammalian ear.
This atavistic feature is so called because its description was first published by Charles Darwin in the opening pages of The Descent of Man, as evidence of a vestigial feature indicating common ancestry among primates. However, Darwin himself named it the Woolnerian tip, after Thomas Woolner, a British sculptor who had depicted it in one of his sculptures and had first theorised that it was an atavistic feature.
The gene for Darwin's tubercle is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and has incomplete penetrance, meaning that those who possess the gene will not necessarily present with the phenotype.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Laura |last1=Spinney |year=2008 |title=Vestigial organs: Remnants of evolution |journal=New Scientist |issue=2656 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19826562.100-vestigial-organs-remnants-of-evolution.html |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61231-2 |volume=198 |pages=42[/tpl]

[[Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee]]

Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee ([tpl]lang-pl|Polrewkom[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ru|Польревком[/tpl]) (July–August 1920) was a revolutionary committee created under the patronage of Soviet Russia with the goal to establish a Polish Soviet Socialist Republic.
Polrevkom was created on July 23, 1920, in Moscow by the "Polish Bureau" of Bolsheviks, with chairman Julian Marchlewski. The decision was made during the initial successes of the Red Army during the Polish-Soviet War with the goal of providing administration of the Polish territories. The Committee was declared "provisional", because it was assumed that after a Soviet victory the power would be transferred to the Polish Communist Workers' Party.
The Polrevkom was assembled on July 24 in Smolensk, with its headquarters in an armored train, which quickly proceeded to Minsk (July 25), Wilno (July 27), and arrived to Białystok on July 30, 1920. It set up permanent headquarters in the Branicki Palace and issued public proclamations. For their efforts they received from Moscow over 2 billion rubles.Zbiór afiszów i druków ulotnych 1944-1950, nr z 376, sygn. 262 "Wystawa - 50 lat Archiwum w Białymstoku",[tpl]pl icon[/tpl] retrieved on: August 9, 2007. It is seen, like many other Bolshevik revolutionary committees, as a Bolshevik puppet government.[ref]Evan Mawdsley, The Russian Civil War,  Pegasus Books, 2007
ISBN 1-933648-15-5, Google Print, p.255[/ref]
The committee consisted of the following members:
The Polrevkom activity was related to the North-Western front of the Red Army. The South-Western front of the Red Army supported a similar Galician Revolutionary Committee (Galrevkom), seated in Tarnopol in Eastern Galicia.
The TKRP had very little support from the ethnic Polish population and recruited its supporters mostly from the ranks of Jews; 1918 Białystok were it was set up had about 75% Jewish majority.Ronald Grigor Suny, The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-508105-6, Google Print, p.106
On 22 August 1920 the Polrevkom moved out of Białystok to Minsk with the defeat of the Red Army, and was dissolved soon afterwards. A significant number of the key persons involved were later instrumental in creation of the Polish Autonomous District within the Soviet Union.

She was launched on 28 November 1940, and was fitted for minesweeping. She served in World War II; her commanding officer for parts of 1943 and 1944 was Lieutenant Orme G. Stuart.
On 9 January 1944 Abelia encountered a U-Boat while on convoy escort duty, and moved to attack with depth charges. Lieutenant Stuart ordered an increase in speed at 950 yards to prevent being torpedoed, not knowing that the U-boat was equipped with T5 torpedoes, for which he would have needed to increase speed at 700 yards. Abelia was hit and lost her rudder, and the U-boat escaped.
She was sold in 1947 and became the merchant vessel Kraft in 1948. She was renamed Arne Skontorp in 1954. She was eventually scrapped in December 1966.

KDFX-CA is the low-powered, Class A Fox-affiliated television station for the Inland Empire's Coachella Valley licensed to Indio/Palm Springs, California. It broadcasts an analog signal on UHF channel 33 and a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 39 (or virtual channel 33.2 via PSIP) from a transmitter on Edom Hill in Cathedral City. 
Owned by the News-Press & Gazette Company, the station is sister to ABC affiliate KESQ-TV, Class A CBS affiliate KPSP-CD, low-powered CW affiliate KCWQ-LP/LD, and low-powered Telemundo affiliate KUNA-LP/LD. All five outlets share studios at Melanie Place in Palm Desert. Syndicated programming on this station includes How I Met Your Mother, The Simpsons, Family Guy, Anderson, and The Nate Berkus Show among others. KDFX can also be seen over-the-air on KESQ's forth digital subchannel. 
This can be seen on UHF channel 43.4 from the same Edom Hill transmitter which redirects to virtual channel 33.2 via PSIP. Along with other major Coachella Valley television stations, the station identifies itself on-air using its cable designation (Fox 11) rather than its over-the-air channel position. The unusual practice stems in part from the area's exceptionally high cable penetration rate of 80.5% which is one of the highest in the United States.

Dodd was born and brought up in Wrexham, Denbighshire where his father Charles was a headmaster at Victoria School. It was a family of modest means but studious inclinations; one of his three brothers, C. H. Dodd, achieved particular distinction as a New Testament scholar. Having attended Grove Park Grammar School in the town he went up to New College, Oxford in 1911, and after graduating in history, joined the RAMC (2nd West Lancashire Field Ambulance) in 1914 with whom he saw active service in France.
Dodd was appointed Lecturer in History at University College, Bangor in 1919, and succeeded Sir John Edward Lloyd as Professor of History there in 1930, a post he retained until his retirement in 1958. He also taught in the Extra-Mural Department, and was stalwart of the WEA (Workers' Educational Association) and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. In retirement he was Curator of Bangor museum, and taught at Bangor Normal College (now part of the University of Wales, Bangor). 
He was a founder member of the Denbighshire Historical Society and edited a history of Wrexham to coincide with the Borough Centenary Celebration in 1957. He was made a freeman of the Borough of Wrexham in 1963. A centenary celebration of his birth was held in Wrexham in 1991.
Though not a native speaker, Dodd was a supporter of the Welsh language and brought up his children as Welsh speakers, at a time when the language had far less social status than now.

The Blaze magazine (titled Fusion before September 2012) is a publication founded and edited by Glenn Beck and published by Beck's Mercury Radio Arts. (The former title Fusion was taken from Beck's talk radio program's motto, The Fusion of Entertainment and Enlightenment.)
The magazine is sixteen pages and is published monthly except for February and August. It features several recurring items, including "Stu's 3rd to Last Page", and "By the Numbers" (a listing of trivial facts related to the issue). Other articles deal with politics, pop culture, and society, and are generally written with humorous intent. Some issues have themes (Halloween, Valentine's Day, etc.) that most of the articles adhere to.
Those who attended the 2005 Glenn Beck: On Ice tour received the premiere issue (July 2005), featuring a puppet-like replication of Beck ice skating with training wheels on the cover.
Beck is credited as the magazine's editor-in-chief, with Kevin Balfe as creative director and Liz Julis as managing editor. Beck himself writes little or none of the material, but is involved in overseeing the process to make sure it matches his "voice."
Contributing editors credited in the magazine (and responsible for most of the written content) include: Balfe, Julis, Pat Balfe, Ted Bell, John Bobey, Rick Bovay, Sam Boykin, Stu Burguiere, Evan Cutler, Steve Helling, Timothy Hogan, Scott Mendenhall, Eric D. Snider, and Jason Wright.

Lieutenant Commander Orme G. Stuart, DSC (20 February 1914 – 4 February 1990) was a businessperson and officer with the Royal Canadian Navy.
He served as a reservist in the Royal Canadian Navy before the Second World War and was seconded to the Royal Navy during the war. From February until August 1943, he commanded the Flower-class corvette HMS Pennywort, and in August was transferred to command HMS Abelia.
On 9 January 1944 Commander Stuart's ship encountered a U-Boat while on convoy escort duty, and moved to attack with depth charges. He ordered an increase in speed at 950 yards to prevent being torpedoed, not knowing that the U-boat was equipped with T5 torpedoes, for which he would have needed to increase speed at 700 yards. Abelia was hit and lost her rudder, and the U-boat escaped.
Stuart next commanded the Captain-class frigate Fitzroy, during which time he played a key role in sinking two U-boats. On 27 March 1945 U-722 was sunk near the Hebrides by depth charges from Fitzroy and her sister ships Redmill and Byron. On 8 April 1945 U-1001 was sunk off Land's End by Fitzroy and Byron. For these victories Stuart was awarded the DSC.  
After the war, he lived in Prince Rupert, British Columbia and had four children.  He also became president of the local Chamber of Commerce.  He died in Vancouver in 1990.

Mammy Kate was a house slave who belonged to future Governor Stephen Heard (1740–1815) of Georgia. She lived in what was then Wilkes County, Georgia, now Elbert County, Georgia. 
In an 1820 letter she was said to be the "biggest and tallest" black woman the writer had ever seen and had "proven herself to be a strong, a kindly, a never failing friend to Colonel Heard and his family."McIntosh, John H., History of Elbert County, Georgia, 1790-1935, p. 221. Of pure African descent, she claimed to be the daughter of a great king.
Heard suffered a great deal at the hands of the Tories. They forced his wife out into a snow storm, and she and their young, adopted daughter died from exposure. Then he was captured by the British and sentenced to death.
Ostensibly to care for his needs, Kate followed him to his prison. One morning she presented herself with a large covered basket on her head. She told the sentry on duty that she was there to pick up Colonel Heard's soiled linen and was admitted to his cell. There she put Heard, who was a small man, in the basket and calmly sauntered pass the guard with him in the basket balanced on her head.
The previous night she had secreted two of Heard's fine Arabian horses—Lightfoot and Silverheels—on the outskirts of Augusta, where he was imprisoned. She carried Heard to where she had hidden the horses, and she and Heard rode away. It is said that on the ride he offered to set her free, but she responded by telling him that he could set her free, but she was never going to set him free.
He gave her freedom and a deed to a small tract of land and a four-roomed house, but she continued to serve the Heard family, turning over on her death bed her children to his family.McIntosh, p. 23

[[Broadband Global Area Network]]

CATEGORIES: Internet service providers, Broadband

The Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) is a global satellite internet network with telephony using portable terminals.  The terminals are normally used to connect a laptop computer to broadband Internet in remote locations, although as long as line-of-sight to the satellite exists, the terminal can be used anywhere.  The value of BGAN terminals is that unlike other satellite Internet services which require bulky and heavy satellite dishes to connect, a BGAN terminal is about the size of a laptop and thus can be carried easily.  The network is provided by Inmarsat and uses three geostationary satellites called I-4 to provide almost global coverage.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2009/02/26/4016324.htm | title=INMARSAT: Inmarsat Broadband Goes Global[/tpl]

The Security and Freedom Enhancement (SAFE) Act is legislation proposed by Senators Larry Craig (R-ID), John E. Sununu (R-NH) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) which would add checks and balances to the USA PATRIOT Act. This legislation, which was introduced in the House on April 6, 2005, would curtail some powers of the USA PATRIOT Act by requiring court reviews and reporting requirements. 
The SAFE Act would also revise the definition of "terrorist" to exclude certain groups of people such as anti-war protesters and abortion demonstrators.
This legislation was introduced to provide an alternative to the USA PATRIOT Act that some felt was too overreaching in its effort to fight terrorism.

[[Inveresk]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in East Lothian, Musselburgh

Inveresk (Gaelic: Inbhir Easg) is a village in East Lothian, Scotland situated immediately to the south of Musselburgh. It forms one of the finest conservation areas in Scotland having been designated a conservation area since 1969. It is situated on slightly elevated ground on the north bank of a loop of the River Esk. This ridge of ground, 20 to 25 metres above sea level, was used by the Romans as the location for a  fort in the second century AD.Burnet,JEM (1999) A reason for Inveresk. Courtyard Press, Inveresk. ISBN 0-9537450-0-7
The element "Inver", from the Gaelic inbhir, refers to the confluence of the river Esk with the Firth of Forth. [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.spns.org.uk/PNsMIDLOTHIANv3.pdf | title = The Placenames of Midlothian | accessdate = 2012-07-04 | last = Dixon | first = Norman | format = PDF[/tpl] "'The mouth of the R. Esk' v. G. inbhir, inbhear: 'the confluence of a stream with the sea.'"
The village was formerly in the Midlothian parish of the same name and developed distinctly from the separate burgh of Musselburgh.
Inveresk is notable for its fine street of 17th- and 18th-century houses. Inveresk Lodge is now privately leased, but the adjacent Inveresk Lodge Garden belongs to the National Trust for Scotland, and its west facing gardens overlooking the river Esk are open to the public. This was formerly the mansion of James Wedderburn who had made his fortune as a slave-owning sugar plantation owner in Jamaica. When his son by one of his slaves, Robert Wedderburn, travelled to Inveresk to claim his kinship he was insultingly rejected by his father who gave him some small beer and a broken or bent sixpence. This experience turned Robert Wedderburn to radicalism.

Iolanta, Op. 69, ([tpl]lang-ru|Иоланта[/tpl]) is a lyric opera in one act by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, his last. The libretto was written by the composer's brother Modest Tchaikovsky, and is based on the Danish play Kong Renés Datter (King René’s Daughter) by Henrik Hertz, a romanticised account of the life of Yolande de Bar. In the original Danish play, the spelling of the princess's name was "Iolanthe", which was a cause of confusion with the Gilbert and Sullivan opera of that name.Henry Irving had produced a version of King René's Daughter in 1880, in London, under the name Iolanthe, so Gilbert asked his producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, to request Irving's permission to use the name. See Ainger, Michael. Gilbert and Sullivan – A Dual Biography, Oxford University Press (2002), p. 212; and Bradley, Ian. The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan, Oxford University Press (1996), p. 364 The play was translated by Fyodor Miller and adapted by Vladimir Zotov. The opera received its premiere on 18 December 1892 in St. Petersburg.

The song was released on R.E.M.'s 1992 album Automatic for the People and was later released as a single in 1993, reaching #17 in the UK Singles Chart.Chartstats – UK Chart details
The song was placed on R.E.M.'s Warner Bros. "best of" album In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003 in 2003, although Peter Buck's personal sleeve notes on the song were not complimentary.

[[Nelson rules]]

CATEGORIES: Quality control tools, Technical communication, Statistical charts and diagrams

Nelson rules are a method in process control of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). Rules,  for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first postulated by Walter A. Shewhart Engineering Statistics Handbook 6.3.2, NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods National Institute of Standards and Technology, Dec 2006 in the 1920s.  The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an article by Lloyd S Nelson.Lloyd S. Nelson, "Technical Aids," Journal of Quality Technology 16, no. 4 (October 1984), 238-239.
The rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based around the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.
The above eight rules apply to a chart of a variable value. 
A second chart, the moving range chart, can also used but only with rules 1, 2, 3 and 4. Such a chart plots a graph of the maximum value - minimum value of N adjacent points against the time sample of the range.
An example moving range: if N = 3 and values are 1, 3, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5 then the sets of adjacent points are (1,3,5) (3,5,3) (5,3,3) (3,3,2) (3,2,4) (2,4,5) resulting in moving range values of (5-1) (5-3) (5-3) (3-2) (4-2) (5-2) = 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3.
Applying these rules indicates when a potential "out of control" situation has arisen. However there will always be some false alerts and the more rules applied the more will occur. For some processes, it may be beneficial to omit one or more rules. Equally there may be some missing alerts where some specific "out of control" situation is not detected. Empirically, the detection accuracy is good.

CATEGORIES: Animal rights, Animal shelters, Animal welfare, Cats as pets, Dogs as pets, Domesticated animals, Feral animals, Population ecology

The phenomenon of overpopulation in domestic animals refers to the surplus of domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, and exotic animals. In the United States alone, between 5-7,000,000 animals are brought to shelters each year. 3-4,000,000 of those animals are subsequently euthanized. This is sometimes attributed to the fact that most shelters do not have the resources for the long-term care of these animals.[tpl]cite web|author=The Humane Society of the United States |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html |title=HSUS Pet Overpopulation Estimates : The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Humanesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24[/tpl] As a result, most humane societies, animal shelters and rescue groups urge animal caregivers to have their animals spayed or neutered to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters.

[[Dough scraper]]
CATEGORIES: Cooking utensils

A dough scraper is a tool used by bakers to manipulate dough and to clean surfaces on which dough has been worked. It is generally a small sheet of stainless steel (approximately 3"×5" or 8 cm × 13 cm) with a handle of wood, plastic, or simply a roll in the steel blade along one of the long sides. 
Bakers and pastry chefs use this tool to help pick up, turn, and portion dough. When finished, the dough scraper can be used to scrape up the little bits of dough that have dried onto the kneading surface during the forming process. It can also be used in a more generic kitchen role to transfer sliced or diced foods from cutting board to pan.
This tool is known by a variety of names, including dough scraper, dough cutter, dough knife, pastry cutter, bench scraper, board scraper, and bench knife.
Some modern varieties of this tool have handles of nylon or silicone and even feature both straight and curved edges. These are intended primarily for the use of scraping cutting boards and bowls rather than working dough.  These uses have introduced further variants of the name, including terms such as bowl scraper or chopper, scooper, scraper.

Dysplastic nevi often grow to larger than ordinary moles, and may have irregular and indistinct borders. Their color may not be uniform, and may range from light pink to very dark brown.  They usually begin as flat, but parts may raise above the skin surface.  See ABCDE and "ugly duckling" characteristics below.  
Dysplastic nevi can be found anywhere, but are most common on the trunk in men, and on the calves in women.

[[Tympanostomy tube]]

CATEGORIES: Audiology, Diseases of middle ear and mastoid, Pediatrics, Surgery

A tympanostomy tube (also known as a grommet, T-tube, ear tube, pressure equalization tube, vent, PE tube or myringotomy tube) is a small tube inserted into the eardrum in order to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period of time, and to prevent the accumulation of fluid in the middle ear.  The operation to insert the tube involves a myringotomy and is performed under local or general anesthesia. The tube itself is made in a variety of designs.  The most commonly used type is shaped like a grommet.  When it is necessary to keep the middle ear ventilated for a very long period, a "T"-shaped tube may be used, as these "T-tubes" can stay in place for 2-4 years.  Materials used to construct the tube are most often plastics such as silicone or Teflon.  Stainless steel tubes exist, but are no longer in frequent use.

[[Image:Two hybrid assay.svg|thumb|400px| Overview of two-hybrid assay, checking for interactions between two proteins, called here Bait and Prey.

A. Gal4 transcription factor gene produces two domain protein (BD and AD), which is essential for transcription of the reporter gene (LacZ).

B,C. Two fusion proteins are prepared: Gal4BD+Bait and Gal4AD+Prey. None of them is usually sufficient to initiate the transcription (of the reporter gene) alone.

D. When both fusion proteins are produced and Bait part of the first interact with Prey part of the second, transcription of the reporter gene occurs.
]]
Two-hybrid screening (also known as yeast two-hybrid system or Y2H) is a molecular biology technique used to discover protein–protein interactions and protein–DNA interactions by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively.
The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.

The RT-21 was the first mobile ICBM developed by the Soviet Union, it's innovative concept and design created by Alexander Nadiradze. The RT-21M Pioner (SS-20 Saber)'s, as well as their succeeding missile complexes would rely on the SS-16 base concept and was used by Nadiradze for many of his later projects. The program became mired in a series of treaty complications, including questions regarding its use of theatre missile launchers. Ultimately, it is unlikely that the RT-21 reached deployment, and by the mid-1980s, the program had been scrapped.

The aircraft served on battleships and cruisers in a seaplane configuration, being launched by catapult and recovered from a sea landing. The wings folded back against the fuselage for storage aboard ship. When based ashore or on carriers the single float was replaced by fixed wheeled landing gear.
Curtiss delivered 258 SOC aircraft, in versions SOC-1 through SOC-4, beginning in 1935. The SOC-3 design was the basis of the Naval Aircraft Factory SON-1 variant, of which the NAF delivered 64 aircraft from 1940.

[[Nicotiana alata]]

CATEGORIES: Tobacco, Nicotiana, Garden plants

Nicotiana alata is a species of tobacco. It is called Winged Tobacco, Jasmine Tobacco, tanbaku, and sometimes Persian Tobacco, though the latter name is also used for Nicotiana persica.
Unlike the latter species, which is of some commercial importance in the production of Iranian Tobacco Company cigarettes, N. alata is mainly grown as an ornamental plant; numerous cultivars and hybrids are derived from it. In Iran, narghila tobacco is sometimes produced from N. alata; it is not chopped like cigarette tobacco, but broken up by hand.
Has a lovely fragrance in the evening to night. Most varieties bloom late-afternoon to evening. Seedlings do best when gradually introduced to outdoor environment over the course of a week. Plants tend to self-sow. (Color may be the original or occasionally several colors on one plant).
Deadhead spent flower stalks for best blooming results.

The University of New Hampshire at Manchester (or UNHM) was established in 1985 as the sixth college of the University of New Hampshire.[tpl]cite web| title=UNH Manchester – University System of New Hampshire| publisher=usnh.edu| accessdate=2009-02-05| url=http://www.usnh.edu/institutions/unhm.shtml[/tpl] Located in Manchester, UNH Manchester provides associate's, bachelor's, and master's, with special emphasis on programs that address urban issues. UNH Manchester has a collaborative agreement with the neighboring New Hampshire Institute of Art that allows students interested in pursuing a degree in Fine Art to transfer into the Institute's BFA program.  The college also has an articulation agreement with the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences campus in Manchester which allows students to dual enroll in the pre-pharmacy or physician assistant programs. UNH Manchester also has established an international partnership with the Institute at Palazzo Rucellai in Florence, Italy, which allows students from its Politics and Society program to study abroad.
Each semester approximately 1,500 students commute to the city campus to take classes in the University Center building, where the college moved during the 1999 through 2001 academic years from its old campus on Hackett Hill near Hooksett, New Hampshire; for more than a decade, the college had maintained both campuses, with the bulk of the campus and most support functions on Hackett Hill and limited class offerings in the former textile mill building. Due to its central location in Manchester, the largest city in the state, UNH Manchester is within a thirty minutes' drive of half the state's population. For this reason, and the lack of on-campus housing, the school considers itself to be the University's "commuter college."
University Center is located at 400 Commercial Street on the banks of the Merrimack River in Manchester's historic millyard.  The [tpl]convert|75000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] building, built in 1880, formerly housed the machine shop of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.
UNH Manchester is a college of the University of New Hampshire. The University of New Hampshire is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc.

The stadium has a roof over the field and the stands, like other indoor ballparks. However, it lacks a wall behind the stands so that natural air comes into the field. This makes it possible for home runs to leave the stadium, something not possible in typical domed stadiums.
The stadium was built in 1979 without the roof and named [tpl]nihongo|Seibu Lions Stadium|西武ライオンズ球場|Seibu Raionzu Kyūjō[/tpl] as the new home field of the Lions that moved from Fukuoka to Tokorozawa that year. The installation of the roof took place in two phases: the first phase after the 1997 season, and the second phase after the 1998 seasons. At the beginning of the 1998 season, the stadium was renamed Seibu Dome although the domed roof had not completed yet.

The Cave of the Winds was a natural cave behind Bridal Veil Falls at the Niagara Falls.
The cave was some [tpl]convert|130|ft[/tpl] high, [tpl]convert|100|ft[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|30|ft|0[/tpl] in depth. It was discovered in 1834, and originally dubbed Aeolus' Cave, after the Greek god of winds. Guided tours began officially in 1841, and continued until a rock fall in 1920 made it clear the passage was no longer safe. The tour officially reopened in 1924, now bringing visitors to the front of the Bridal Veil instead of behind it, on a series of decks and walkways. Tropical storm-like conditions can be experienced, as winds can reach up to 68 mph underneath the falls.
The cave was obliterated in a massive 1954 rockfall and subsequent dynamiting of a dangerous overhang.
Today, the "Cave of the Winds" is the name of a tourist attraction near the same site. An elevator takes people from the area between the American and Canadian Falls down to the level of the Niagara River at the base of the American Falls. A series of redwood decks and platforms allow sightseers to walk right up to the base of the Bridal Veil Falls with water crashing down right on them and flowing beneath the decking.
The decking is removed each fall due to the potential damage caused by ice buildup at the falls and re-installed each spring by park officials for sightseers to enjoy the experience. The decking is not secured to the rocks below by bolts or other construction materials; the wood beam supports are simply wedged into the rock crevices.

[[Church tabernacle]]

CATEGORIES: Christian religious objects, Eucharistic objects, Church architecture

A tabernacle is the fixed, locked box in which, in some Christian churches, the Eucharist is "reserved" (stored). A less obvious container, set into the wall, is called an aumbry.
Within Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and in some congregations of Anglicanism and Lutheranism, a tabernacle is a box-like vessel for the exclusive reservation of the consecrated Eucharist. It is normally made of metal, stone or wood, is lockable and secured to its altar to prevent the consecrated elements within from being removed without authorization. The "reserved Eucharist" is secured there for distribution at services, for availability to bring Holy Communion to the sick, and, especially in the Western Church, as the center of attention for meditation and prayer. The term "tabernacle" arose for this item as a reference to the Old Testament tabernacle which was the locus of God's presence among the Jewish people - hence, it was formerly required (and is still generally customary) that the tabernacle be covered with a tent-like veil or curtains across its door when the Eucharist is present within.
By way of metaphor, Catholics and Orthodox alike also refer to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Tabernacle in their devotions (such as the Akathist Hymn or Catholic Litanies to Mary), as she carried within her the body of Christ in her role as Theotokos.

[[Stadium seating]]
CATEGORIES: Concerts, Roller coaster technology

Stadium seating or theater seating is a characteristic seating arrangement that is most commonly associated with performing-arts venues, and derives its name from stadiums, which typically use this arrangement. In stadium seating, most or all seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them so that the occupants of further-back seats have less of their views blocked by those further forward. This is especially necessary in stadiums where the subject matter is typically best observed from above, rather than in-line or from below. In addition to sports venues and performing arts venues, many other venues that require clear audience views of a single area use stadium seating, including religious institutions, lecture halls, and movie theaters.
An alternative to stadium seating is to place the focal area at a higher level than the audience so that the audience may look above those people in front of them to see, avoiding blocked sight-lines (like the green circle in the illustration, right). One example of this is floor seating of a concert which has a raised stage; seats are commonly all at an equal height on the actual floor of a venue, such as the floor seats at a concert held in a sports arena.
Because the increased angle of stadium seating, seats are typically (but not universally) installed on a stepped floor surface which also functions as a staircase in the aisles. This is as opposed to the common usage of a flat, often slightly sloped, floor used in many standard seating venues (such as many stage theaters). There has been some criticism of stadium seating[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] because, due to the stepped layout, it is usually not possible for disabled people in wheelchairs to move about. Venues with stadium seating generally place handicapped seating among the row which is at the level of the concourse which feeds the seating area, leaving more space than rows above or below it, and leaving chair-less space(s) for wheelchairs.
The trains on some roller coasters are also configured in tiers; this seating configuration is also sometimes called stadium seating. Three prominent examples of roller coasters whose trains use this type of seating are Millennium Force at Cedar Point,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] which opened in 2000, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] which opened in 2005, and Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, which opened in 2007.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Converting sloped-floor theaters to stadium seating often requires raising the ceiling and adding risers, so owners of movie theaters often judge conversion as not cost effective.[tpl]cite news |first=Richard |last=Connelly |work=Houston Press |title=A Loew(s) Blow |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-03-15/news/a-loew-s-blow/ |date=March 15, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2011[/tpl]

[[Computer Output to Laser Disc]]

CATEGORIES: Content management systems

Computer Output to Laser Disc (COLD), now also called enterprise report management (ERM), systems are used to capture, archive, store, and retrieve large-volume data such as accounting reports, loan records, inventories, shipping and receiving documents, and customer bills. These systems are typically implemented to replace paper creation and microfiche solutions.  The term COLD has been superseded by the Enterprise Content Management Industry (AIIM), ANSI, and ISO with the term "enterprise report management".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl]
ERM (previously referred to as COLD) systems usually work by capturing data from print streams[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] and storing it on hard drives, storage area networks, or optical media. The data is then retrieved via web browsers or fat clients. ERM systems are part of enterprise content management.
In 2002, Mason Grigsby — widely regarded as "The Father of COLD" for his seminal work with INSCI in the late 1980s — promoted a name change for the technology and pointed out that "ERM" more accurately describes the process. The use of laserdiscs was replaced by the use of other optical storage technologies and is only one of several appropriate media for computer report storage.

[[Aliens Appeals Board of Sweden]]

Aliens Appeals Board (Utlänningsnämnden, UN) was a Swedish government agency that answered to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The agency was located in Stockholm.
The Board's powers were similar to those of a court of law. It tried cases under the old Swedish Aliens Act of 1989 and the Swedish Citizenship Act. It also bore a responsibility for the development of case law in these areas. Its decisions could not be appealed, although in special cases the Board would submit an application to the Swedish Government for a decision.
The Aliens Appeals Board was discontinued and replaced by Migration Courts on 31 March 2006 when the new Aliens Act entered into force. The new rules of jurisdiction and procedure mean that individuals appealing against the decisions of the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) will be able to obtain an oral hearing in a Migration Court, in accordance with the provisions governing administrative courts. The opposite party in court proceedings will be the Swedish Migration Board.

Faurot Field [tpl]IPAc-en|f|ɔː|ˈ|r|oʊ[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ[/tpl] at Memorial Stadium is the home field of the University of Missouri Tigers in Columbia, Missouri. It is primarily used for football. In 1972, Memorial Stadium's playing surface was named Faurot Field in honor of longtime coach Don Faurot. During the offseason, soccer goals are set up in the end zones and it is used for intramural matches. It also hosts the annual "Providence Bowl" game between Hickman and Rock Bridge high schools (so named because both schools are located on Providence Road in Columbia, and Faurot is roughly equidistant between the two) and in the past has been home to the MSHSAA football championships, now held in St. Louis (taking advantage of the climate-controlled atmosphere of the Edward Jones Dome).  It is the second largest sports facility by capacity in the state of Missouri, second to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.
When full, Faurot Field would be the ninth-largest city in the state of Missouri.
The stadium is a typical horseshoe-shaped stadium, with seating added on in the "open" endzone. The horseshoe is completed by a grass berm in the curved end, which is used for general admission on game days. The berm is famous for the giant block "M" made of painted white stones located behind the endzone.
There is road between the field and the stands around the entire length of the horseshoe, taking the place of the track, removed in the mid-1990s.

Hollingworth Lake is a [tpl]convert|130|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] reservoir at Smithy Bridge, in Littleborough — part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, in Greater Manchester, England. The lake was originally built as the main water source for the Rochdale Canal, but developed as a tourist resort from the 1860s, and became known as the Weighver's Seaport. Hotels were built around it, at least two of which had outdoor dancing stages with gas lighting.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] Tourism was helped by the arrival of the railway in 1839, which brought day-trippers and weekend visitors from Manchester, Bradford and Leeds. 
The popularity of the lake as a resort declined in the early twentieth century, and the area was used as an army camp during the First World War. The canal company sold the reservoir, with seven others, to the Oldham and Rochdale Corporations for water supply in 1923, by which time the canal was in terminal decline. After the Second World War, boating rights were bought by Rochdale Council, who developed the area into the Hollingworth Lake Country Park in 1974. There has been a steady increase in facilities since, and it is now a thriving centre for water sports and other activities.
The lake was used for training by Captain Matthew Webb[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl], before he became the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, and was used for the "World Professional Mile Championship", a long-distance swimming event, in the 1880s. It is home to the Hollingworth Lake Rowing Club, which has been in continuous existence since 1872.

It is a popular preparation, particularly in France. Oscillococcinum is manufactured by a French company, Boiron, its sole manufacturer. There are, however, other manufacturers who make similar preparations. Oscillococcinum is used in more than 50 countries. In France, it has been in production for over 65 years.
The preparation is derived from duck liver and heart, diluted to 200C—a ratio of one part duck offal to 10400 parts water. This is such a high dilution that the final product likely contains not a single molecule of the original liver. Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an "imprint" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo.

Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine. With the molecular formula Au2Cl6, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl4, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as "gold chloride", "acid gold trichloride" or even "gold(III) chloride trihydrate." Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light.

[[Metadata (CLI)]]
CATEGORIES: Common Language Infrastructure

Metadata, in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), refers to certain data structures embedded within the Common Intermediate Language code that describes the high-level structure of the code. Metadata describes all classes and class members that are defined in the assembly, and the classes and class members that the current assembly will call from another assembly. The metadata for a method contains the complete description of the method, including the class (and the assembly that contains the class), the return type and all of the method parameters. 
A CLI language compiler will generate the metadata and store this in the assembly containing the CIL. When the run-time executes CIL it will check to make sure that the metadata of the called method is the same as the metadata that is stored in the calling method. This ensures that a method can only be called with exactly the right number of parameters and exactly the right parameter types.
The Windows Runtime application platform, present in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, makes use of the CLI metadata format to describe component interfaces for code written in any of the supported programming languages. A difference in use within the Common Language Runtime is that an assembly typically does not contain any CIL instructions.

The village is located at the crossroads of the A34 with the B5392 approximately half-way between Alderley Edge and Congleton.

Redesmere, created as a feeder reservoir for the ornamental lakes of Capesthorne Hall in the late 18th century, once had an island. According to popular belief the island floated, and it is marked as such on the 1842 One Inch Ordnance Survey map, though the 1975 1:25000 Ordnance Survey map shows that it had become joined with the bank by then.The Floating Island of Redesmere Local legend says that it came into being as a result of a vow by a knight who believed his lady was unfaithful, and that he would not look on her face again until the island floated. Soon after he fell ill, but she remained loyal to him and nursed him back to health. There then followed a storm which tore the island from the bottom of the lake, and it floated ever since, clearing the lady's name.[tpl]cite book | last = Hope | first = Robert Charles | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England | publisher = Elliot Stock | year = 1893 | location = London | pages = 6 | url = | doi = | id =  [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Hole | first = Christina | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Traditions and Customs of Cheshire | publisher = Williams and Norgate Ltd | year = 1937 | location = London | pages = 60 | url = | doi = | id =  [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Woods | first = Frederick | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Further Legends and Traditions of Cheshire | publisher = Shiva Publishing Ltd | year = 1983 | location = Cheshire | pages = 8 | url =  | doi =  | id = ISBN 0 906812 56 9 [/tpl]

Serbian cuisine ([tpl]lang-sr|српска кухиња / srpska kuhinja[/tpl]) is a heterogeneous cuisine, sharing characteristics of the Balkans (especially former Yugoslavia), the Mediterranean (especially Greek), Turkish, and Central European (especially Austrian and Hungarian) cuisines.
The national dishes include pljeskavica (a ground beef patty), ćevapi (grilled minced meat), and sarma. The national drink is the plum brandy šljivovica. 
Serbian food is characterized not only of elements from Serbia, but of elements from the former-Yugoslavia as a whole. Peasantry has greatly influenced the cooking process. During the centuries under Ottoman rule, the Balkans were influenced by the rich oriental cuisine and some of the most traditional Serbian dishes have common roots with those of Greece and Turkey. Centuries of Austrian and Austro-Hungarian rule richly influenced Serbian cuisine, especially Serbian desserts.
In recent times, the Serbian diaspora has spread the cuisine across the world.

[[Dysteleology]]

Dysteleology is the philosophical view that existence has no telos or final cause from purposeful design. The term "dysteleology" is a modern word invented and popularized by Ernst Haeckel.[tpl]cite journal|title=Natural Selection and Dysteleology|author=Romanes, George J.|journal=Nature|volume=9|pages=361–2|date=1874-03-12|doi=10.1038/009361a0|issue=228[/tpl] Dysteleology is an aggressive, yet optimistic, form of science-oriented atheism originally perhaps associated with Haeckel and his followers, but now perhaps more associated with the type of atheism of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, or Christopher Hitchens. Unlike traditional philosophical and religious perspectives, modern philosophical naturalism sees existence as having no inherent goal. Philosophical schools that have rejected dysteleology include German idealism (including the philosophies of Hegel and Schelling), Integral theory, and some adherents to the Anthropic principle.

[[IBM 702]]

CATEGORIES: IBM vacuum tube computers, IBM 700/7000 series, 1953 introductions

The IBM 702 was IBM's response to the UNIVAC—the first mainframe computer using magnetic tapes. Because these machines had less computational power than the IBM 701 and ERA 1103, which were favored for scientific computing, the 702 was aimed at business computing.Emerson W. Pugh, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, IBM's 360 and early 370 systems, MIT Press, 1991, ISBN 0-262-16123-0 pp. 26-27
The system used electrostatic storage, consisting of 14, 28, 42, 56, or 70 Williams tubes with a capacity of 1000 bits each for the main memory, giving a memory of 2,000 to 10,000 characters of seven bits each (in increments of 2,000 characters), and 14 Williams tubes with a capacity of 512 bits each for the two 512-character accumulators.
A complete system included the following units:
The 702 was announced September 25, 1953 and withdrawn October 1, 1954, but the first production model was not installed until July 1955.Charles J. Bashe, Lyle R. Johnson, John H. Palmer, & Emerson W. Pugh, IBM's Early Computers, MIT Press, 1986, ISBN 0-262-02225-7 pp. 176-178  The successor to the 702 in the 700/7000 series was the IBM 705, which marked the transition to magnetic core memory.
Fourteen 702s were built.  The first one was used at IBM.  Due to problems with the Williams tubes, the decision was made to switch to magnetic core memory instead.  The fourteenth 702 was built using magnetic core memory and the others were retrofitted with magnetic core.

[[Cleopatra Selene I]]

Cleopatra Selene I (Greek:η Κλεοπάτρα Σελήνη) was the daughter of Ptolemy VIII Physcon by his niece Cleopatra III of Egypt. She was the wife of three different kings; including queen consort to Ptolemy IX Lathyros of Egypt, and later queen of Syria.
Originally she was named Selene, only adding the Ptolemaic throne name Cleopatra after her marriage with Lathyros.Strabo, Geographica 16, p. 749; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.420. whom she married after his wife, her sister Cleopatra IV, was forced out by her mother. (115 BC).Justin 39.3.2 Selene was not, however,  made co-ruler, unlike many of the sister-wives of Ptolemaic kings. 
She bore Lathyros at least one daughter, Berenice III and two sons,Justin 39.4.1 including Ptolemy XII and possibly another son, also named Ptolemy. 
In 107 BC, as relations deteriorated between Lathyros and his mother and co-ruler, Cleopatra III, he was forced to leave Egypt and his wife, first to Cyprus to raise an army, and then to south Syria from whence he tried, in 103 BC, to invade Egypt. 
In the meantime, Cleopatra III  established an alliance with  one of the warring Syrian kings, Antiochus VIII Grypus, giving him Cleopatra Selene I as his wife.Justin 39.4.4 (His previous wife, (Cleopatra?) Tryphaena, Cleopatra Selene's I older sister, had been killed in 111 BC by his stepbrother Antiochus IX Cyzicenus).
In Syria, the civil war between Grypus and Cyzicenus over the throne in Antioch lasted until 96 BC, when Grypus was assassinated in Antioch. Cyzicenus, after capturing the capital, married Cleopatra Selene I. (Cyzicenus had been married to Cleopatra Selene's I older sister, Cleopatra IV, who had been killed by Grypus in 112 BC)
Cyzicenus, however, was not to live much longer. Grypus had five sons with Cleopatra Tryphaena; all of them competing for the throne of Antioch. In 95 BC, Cyzicenus was killed during a battle with Seleucus VI Epiphanes, the eldest son of Grypus.
After Cyzicenus' death, his son with Cleopatra IV, Antiochus X Eusebes, married his stepmother, Cleopatra Selene I, and regained Antioch again, with the death of Seleucus VI.  Cleopatra Selene I bore him two sons, one of them being Antiochus XIII Asiaticus.
Antiochus X was killed either in 92 BC in a battle with the Parthians, or in 83 BC. After his death Cleopatra Selene I fearing for her safety, left Syria and for the relative safety of Cilicia.
Following the assassination of her nephew Ptolemy XI Alexander II (80 BC), Cleopatra Selene I remained the only  legitimate surviving member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. She claimed the throne of Egypt for her sons from her fourth marriage, but the people of Alexandria chose the illegitimate Ptolemy XII Auletes as new king. Cleopatra Selene I sent her sons to Rome to present their claims before the senate, but they were unsuccessful, returning home two years later.Cicero, In Verrem actio 4.61-68 
Finally, in 69 BC the Armenian king Tigranes the Great besieged Cleopatra Selene I in Ptolemais, seizing and brutally killing her  in Seleucia.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 13.420; Strabo, Geographica 16, p. 749
One year later, the Romans disrupted the Armenian state, and Cleopatra Selene I's son, Antiochus XIII, the last king of the Seleucid dynasty, tried unsuccessfully to unify the state. Finally, in 63 BC, the Romans captured Syria and the Hellenistic state that Seleucus I Nicator (Greek :Σέλευκος Νικάτωρ) created 240 years before, became part of Rome.

[[Dan Ingram]]

CATEGORIES: 1934 births, Living people, American radio personalities, Radio personalities from New York City, National Radio Hall of Fame inductees, Hofstra University alumni, People from Hempstead (town), New York

Daniel Trombley "Dan" Ingram (born September 7, 1934 in Oceanside, New York) is an American Top 40 radio disc jockey with a forty-year career on radio stations such as WABC and WCBS-FM in New York. "Big Dan"  started broadcasting at WHCH Hofstra College, Hempstead, New York, WNRC, New Rochelle, New York, and WALK-FM, Patchogue, New York.  
Ingram is a well regarded DJ from his era. He was noted for his quick wit and ability to convey a humorous or satiric idea with quick pacing and an economy of words—a skill which has made him uniquely suited to, and successful within, modern personality-driven music radio. He is among the most frequently emulated radio personalities, cited as an influence or inspiration by numerous current broadcasters. One of Ingram's unique skills was his ability to "talk up" to the lyrics of a record, meaning speaking over the musical introduction and finishing exactly at the point when the lyrics started. 
Dan was well known for playing doctored versions of popular songs.  The Paul McCartney & Wings song My Love Does it Good became My 'Glove' Does it Good.  The stuttering title refrain of Bennie and the Jets went from three or four repetitions to countless.  In the same vein, the distinctive refrain added to Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Swede, Ooga-ooga-ooga-chucka would start repeating and listeners would never know when it would end. (Other examples include Paul Simon's 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover, and "rearranging" the spelling of "S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y" on the Bay City Rollers' Saturday Night.) 
Dan's longtime closing theme song was "Tri-Fi Drums" by Billy May.  An edited version of the song was used for broadcast.
Dan is not related to Clarke Ingram, another top 40 radio personality in New York City who worked at Z-100 during the early 1990s.  Clarke has said that he was reluctant to use "Ingram" (his real name) because of Dan's prominence, but that Z-100 encouraged him to do so because at the time Dan was not on the air at any station.  About six months later, Dan returned to the air, doing weekends at WCBS-FM, and the two occasionally competed in the same time slots.  Some listeners mistakenly assumed that Clarke was Dan's son, or another relative.  (A photo of Dan and Clarke meeting each other for the first time appeared in the radio trade publication FMQB in 1997.) However, Dan's son, Chris, is currently a DJ at WVOS-FM in Monticello, NY.
Dan commented occasionally about the pronunciation of his name: jingles often are heard pronouncing his last name as "Ing-ram," but Dan has said it is correctly pronounced "In-gram." As a tribute to Dan in later years, ESPN's Chris Berman would do the same when saying the name of New York Giants wide receiver Mark Ingram, pronouncing it "Marrrrrk In-gram".
Dan was interviewed about his career by Mark Simone on WABC Post-Rewound show on May 29, 2006. While discussing a lawsuit filed against him by another person who used his name, he said "shit". While the dump button managed to erase that profanity from the air, his second profanity ("fuck") accidentally went on the air due to a delay problem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2006/060605/nerw.html |title=NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush |accessdate=2006-07-09 |last=Fybush |first=Scott |date=2006-06-05 |publisher=FybuishMedia.com[/tpl]

Her identification with feminism and her focus on bioethics both occurred “by accident”(p. 27) during the writing of her first book, The Sceptical Feminist: A Philosophical Enquiry (Routledge, 1980; Penguin, 1982) – bioethics being central to the abortion debate.http://www.philosophers.co.uk/wpt.htm The book proved to be controversial within and outside feminism, e.g. in regard to standards of rationality,Christine Battersby, Recent work in feminist philosophy, Philosophical Books 1991, 32:4, p. 200 fashion and style, and her liberal stance.Imelda Whelehan, Modern feminist thought: from the second wave to "post-feminism", 1995, Edinburgh University Press, pp. 39–40
Her second book, Human Nature After Darwin: A Philosophical Introduction (Routledge, 2001) explores the so-call Darwin Wars, including what implications Darwinism raises for philosophy and the application of critical thinking to various arguments put forward in the debate.

[[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]]
CATEGORIES: 1813 births, 1869 deaths, Opera composers, Romantic composers, Russian composers, People from Belyovsky District

Alexander Sergeyevich Dargomyzhsky ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Серге́евич Даргомы́жский[/tpl]) ([tpl]OldStyleDate|February 14|1813|February 2[/tpl][tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl][tpl]OldStyleDate|January 17|1869|January 5[/tpl]) was a 19th-century Russian composer. He bridged the gap in Russian opera composition between Mikhail Glinka and the later generation of The Five and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.
Dargomyzhsky was born in Troitsko village, Belyovsky District, Tula Governorate, and educated in Saint Petersburg. He was already known as a talented musical amateur when in 1833 he met Mikhail Glinka and was encouraged to devote himself to composition. His opera Esmeralda (libretto by composer, based on Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame) was composed in 1839 (performed 1847), and his Rusalka was performed in 1856; but he had little success or recognition either at home or abroad, except in Belgium, until the 1860s, when he became the elder statesman, but not a member, of The Five.
His last opera, The Stone Guest, is his most famous work, known as a pioneering effort in melodic recitative.  With the orchestration and the end of the first scene left incomplete at his death, it was finished by César Cui and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and was much prized by The Five for what was perceived as its progressive approach to operatic expression.  It was premiered in 1872, but never became a lasting standard operatic repertoire item.
Dargomyzhsky also left some unfinished opera projects, among them an attempted setting of Pushkin's Poltava, from which a duet survives.  Besides operas, his other compositions include numerous songs, piano pieces, and some orchestral works.
He died in Saint Petersburg in 1869, aged 55.

[[Cheltenham Racecourse]]
CATEGORIES: Horse racing venues in England, Sports venues in Cheltenham

Cheltenham Racecourse is a racecourse for horse racing events, located at Prestbury Park,
The racecourse has a scenic location in a natural amphitheatre just below the escarpment of the Cotswold Hills, at Cleeve Hill, with a capacity of 67,500 spectators. The racecourse also has its own steam railway station (of the same name), although this no longer connects to the national rail network but has since rather been the current southern terminus of the preserved Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.
The main racecourse has two separate courses alongside each other, the Old Course and the New Course. The New Course has a tricky downhill fence and a longer run-in for steeplechases than the Old Course. Hurdle races over two miles on the New Course also have a slight peculiarity in that most of the hurdles are jumped early on in the race with only two hurdles being jumped in the last seven furlongs.
There is also a cross-country course which is laid out inside the main racecourse and is used for cross-country steeplechases.
The racecourse is the home of The Centaur, one of the largest auditoria in the South West of England. This multiple-use complex seats over 2,000 people for conferences and around 4,000 standing for concerts.[tpl]Ref|bbccent[/tpl] It is also home to the Steeplechasing Hall of Fame. The racecourse is the venue for the annual Greenbelt festival and Wychwood Music Festival. The University of Gloucestershire holds its graduation ceremony and summer ball at the racecourse.
From 2008, the racecourse and "The Jockey Club" were in talks with Cheltenham Town F.C. about a possible move to the racecourse. This would have meant the building of a new stadium with a double sided stand, one side in the stadium and the other for watching the races. Talks went on for a while but in December 2011, Cheltenham Town F.C. decided against the move due to the financial gap, which the football club's chairman Paul Baker described as "In the millions".
On 19 July 2013, Cheltenham Racecourse is to have a £45m redevelopment and is to include a new 6,500-capacity grandstand and royal box has been unanimously approved by planners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-23371696|title=Cheltenham Racecourse's £45m development approved|work=BBC News|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl]

Hailu Shawul (also spelled Shawel; Shawil) (Amharic: ሃእሉ ሻዉል; born 1936) is an Ethiopian engineer and the chairman of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD). He was born in Northern Shewa.
Hailu Shawul was the chairman of Kinijit and succeeded Professor Asrat Woldeyes as the head of the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO). However some sources dispute his presidency and show that the AAPO's split into two factions - the All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) and the United Ethiopian Democratic Party-Medhin - was due to Hailu Shawel not gaining the presidency and thus creating his own party. Many believe that the division was tactically mediated by the EPRDF government interference.Antony Shaw, "Some thoughts on the CUD and other opposition parties", Sidama Concern, published 1 December 2005 (accessed 26 October 2009) He contributed to the transformation of the AAPO into the multi-ethnic AEUP, which was one of several that united October 2004 in the CUD, with the goal of fielding candidates in the May 15, 2005 general elections.
As a result of the protests that followed the general elections, the government placed Hailu Shawul under house arrest for a period. When the CUD held an initially peaceful protest the highly armed government security forces augmented the situation by using excessive forces which turned it violent, leading to the deaths of more than 200 peaceful demonstrators in the capital alone and unknown number in countryside in October 2005. The government claimed death of four police officers. Hailu Shawel and 23 other CUD leaders were arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason and genocide."Jailed Ethiopia opposition head risks blindness" (Sudan Tribune) Still imprisoned in December, Hailu Shawul joined with other CUD prisoners on a hunger strike, which has aggravated his diabetes and threatens his vision. As a result of the hunger strike, Hailu Shawul has lost much of his sight,Jailed opposition leader losing sight, failing health (Ethiomedia) and gained access to medical care only after being visited by foreign diplomats."Hailu Shawel admitted to hospital" (Ethiomedia) On December 2007 the Ethiopian Federal Supreme Court pardoned all twenty-four of the CUD members after they pled guilty and made public apologies; his fellow CUD member, Birtukan Mideksa, who was imprisoned and pardoned with him, claims that their pleas and apologies were coerced.
After being freed from prison, Hailu Shawul traveled to America in January 2008 to get medical care for his diabetes.

[[Medical Implant Communication Service]]
CATEGORIES: Bandplans, Implants, Medical technology

Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) is the name of a specification for using a frequency band between 402 and 405 MHz in communication with medical implants. It allows bi-directional radio communication with a pacemaker or other electronic implants. The maximum transmit power is very low, EIRP=25 microwatt, in order to reduce the risk of interfering with other users of the same band. The maximum used bandwidth at any one time is 300 kHz, which makes it a low bit rate system compared with WiFi or Bluetooth. The main advantage is the additional flexibility compared to previously used inductive technologies, which required the external transceiver to touch the skin of the patient. MICS gives a range of a couple of meters.
The standard is defined by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI):

Scholarship on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict recognizes Land Day as a pivotal event in the struggle over land and in the relationship of Arab citizens to the Israeli state and body politic. It is significant in that it was the first time since 1948 that Arabs in Israel organized a response to Israeli policies as a Palestinian national collective. An important annual day of commemoration in the Palestinian national political calendar ever since, it is marked not only by Arab citizens of Israel, but also by Palestinians all over the world.Schulz and Hammer, 2003, p. 77.

A samba school ([tpl]lang-pt|Escola de samba[/tpl]) is a club or dancing school. They practice and often perform in huge square-compounds ("quadras de samba") devoted to practicing and exhibiting samba, an African-Brazilian dance. The schools (which are structured more like a guild than a school in the usual senseRenata de Sá Gonçalves, "The traditional samba school dance as a performative experience", https://www.mecon.nomadit.co.uk/pub/conference_epaper_download.php5?PaperID=6753&MIMEType=application/pdf accessed 12 Mar 2014) have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro-Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system.,Dils A., Albright A., (eds.) "Moving History / Dancing Cultures - A Dance History Reader", Wesleyan University Press 2001:169. and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development.Guillermoprieto, A., "Samba", Jonathan Cape 1990:23-25. The phrase "escola de samba" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals. In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with particular shanty towns ("favela"). Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers."Samba", a documentary directed by Theresa Jessouroun, 2001. Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly carnival parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a "carnavalesco" or carnival director. From 2005,http://cidadedosambarj.globo.com/2012/por/agosto.htmlhttp://cidadedosambarj.globo.com/2012/por/condominio.html some fourteen of the top samba schools in Rio have used a specially designed warehouse complex, the size of ten football pitches,http://cidadedosambarj.globo.com/2012/por/projeto.html called Samba City (Cidade do Samba) to build and house the elaborate floats.  Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the porest in Brazilian society."Imperatriz do Carnival" a documentary directed by Fernando Schultz, 2004. The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America.

The Stone Guest (Каменный гость in Cyrillic, Kamennyj gost'  in transliteration) is an opera in three acts by Alexander Dargomyzhsky from a libretto taken almost verbatim from Alexander Pushkin's play of the same name which had been written in blank verse and which forms part of his collection Little Tragedies.
It was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, 16 February 1872 (Old Style).The Stone Guest (ru: Опера Даргомыжского «Каменный гость»)ru: Опера `Каменный гость`
According to the composer's wishes, the last few lines of tableau 1 were composed by César Cui, and the whole was orchestrated by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Many years later, Rimsky-Korsakov revised his own orchestration of the opera, rewrote a few of Dargomyzhsky's own original passages, and added an orchestral prelude. This version, completed in 1903 and first performed in 1907 at the Bolshoi Theatre, is now considered the standard version.

Bruce McKinley Shanks (1908 – 1980) was an American editorial cartoonist who worked for the Buffalo Evening News during the middle of the 20th century. There he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for "The Thinker" (August 10, 1957), which showed "the dilemma of union membership when confronted by corrupt leaders in some labor unions"."Editorial Cartooning". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-17.
Shanks was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of George Shanks, who owned a local sign painting business.  From 1924 to 1927, he attended Lafayette High School, where he was taught by art instructor Elizabeth Weiffenbach, who later (1936-1939) also influenced the style of science-fiction cover artist Kelly Freas.  Shanks began his employment with the Buffalo Evening News as a copy boy.  His first cartoons appeared in the sports pages.  
One character created by Shanks was Olaf Fub, a name dervied from 'Buffalo' spelled backward.  A drawing of Fub and the phrase, "Olaf Fub sez ..." continued to introduce the commentary of Evening News writers on local events even well after Shanks' death.  
Another character who appeared frequently in Shanks' editorial cartoons was John Q. Public. That name was created by Vaughn Shoemaker, another editorial cartoonist, and is now a placeholder name in the United States. Shanks' cartoons were widely distributed by syndicators throughout the U.S. and the world at the height of his career, so he may have contributed to the establishment of the placeholder.
Beside the Pulitzer, Shanks won eight Freedom Foundation awards and several Page One Awards from the American Newspaper Guild.

[[Ignition coil]]
CATEGORIES: Ignition systems, Electromagnetic coils, Engine components

An ignition coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system which transforms the battery's low voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel.  Some coils have an internal resistor while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12 volt supply. The wire that goes from the ignition coil to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads.
Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points, and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil.  A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses. 
Ignition systems are not required for diesel engines which rely on compression to ignite the fuel/air mixture.

Giovanni Battista Zupi or Zupus (c. 1590 – 1650) was an Italian astronomer, mathematician, and Jesuit priest.
He was born in Catanzaro. In 1639, Giovanni was the first person to discover that the planet Mercury had orbital phases, like those of the Moon and Venus. His observations demonstrated that the planet orbited around the Sun. This occurred thirty years after Galileo's first telescope design, and Zupi's was only slightly more powerful. He died in Naples.
The crater Zupus on the Moon is named after him.

According to the 2009 Kenyan census, Turkana number 855,399, or 2.5% of the Kenyan population, making Turkana the third largest Nilotic ethnic group in Kenya, after the Kalenjin and the Luo, slightly more numerous than the Maasai, and the tenth largest ethnicity in all of Kenya.  Although this figure was initially controversial and rejected as too large by Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya, a court ruling (Feb 7, 2012) by Justice Mohammed Warsame stated that the Kenyan government accepts the 2009 census figures for Turkana.[tpl]cite web|title=No Repeat Census for North Eastern, Turkana|url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/national/national/61496-no-repeat-census-for-north-eastern-turkana|work=The Star|accessdate=10 February 2012|author=Kiplagat, Sam|date=Feb 8, 2012[/tpl]
The language of the Turkana, an Eastern Nilotic language, is also called Turkana; their own name for it is ŋaTurkana or aŋajep a ŋaTurkana.
The Turkana people call themselves ŋiTurkana (The Turkana). The name means the people of Turkan. They are mainly semi-nomadic pastoralists.
The Turkana are noted for raising camels and weaving baskets. In their oral traditions they designate themselves the people of the grey bull, after the Zebu, the domestication of which played an important role in their history. In recent years, development aid programs have aimed at introducing fishing among the Turkana (a taboo in some sections of The Turkana society) with very limited success.
Famous Turkana include Paul Ereng the 1988 800M Olympic Champion and 800M form indoor world record holder; supermodel Ajuma Nasenyana, and key Kenyan government officials including: Kenyan Ambassador to Thailand, H.E. Dr. Richard Titus Ekai; Minister of Labour, Hon. John Kiyonga Munyes - MP; and Hon. Ekwee Ethuro, current Speaker of the Senate and former MP for Turkana Central.

Leeroy Thornhill (born 8 October 1968, Barking, East London) is an English electronic music artist and formerly a rave dancer and occasionally keyboardist of the British rave act The Prodigy. He has produced solo work under the names Longman and Flightcrank. He was born in Barking but raised in Rayne near Braintree in Essex, and grew up as a football and James Brown fan. Thornhill joined The Prodigy along with Keith Flint after they met Liam Howlett at a local rave club. Both were dancers for the band's live show. Thornhill's height is 6 foot 7 inches (200 cm), a whole foot taller than Flint who is 5 foot 7 inches (170 cm) and his style of dance can be described as a 'technical running on the spot'. This style of dance has reportedly had a major influence in the development of the Melbourne Shuffle underground rave dance style, and thus Thornhill was interviewed for the underground dance documentary Melbourne Shuffler to talk about his dancing.
In 2000 Thornhill left the band and went on to record various EPs under the guises of Longman and Flightcrank, however these projects never saw any substantial success. He now DJs at large venues and is still in touch with The Prodigy. During The Prodigy's 'Their Law' tour Thornhill was the DJ support act at several venues. He also works as a regular DJ. He also remixed tracks for other artists, such as the Italian Subsonica's Nuvole Rapide.
Thornhill is currently working with Hyper and appears on their live shows. He appeared at the V Festival in 2007 in Chelmsford, Essex.
His latest project is the creation of Nu skool breaks record label Electric Tastebuds.Electric Tastebuds He has recently signed breakbeat act The Wrongstar Society to the label.
In October 2008, a music video was created for "Everything U Need", a track by Thornhill's Smash Hi-Fi project. The video was Directed by Philip Carrer and Bleeding Apple.

[[Short ram air intake]]

CATEGORIES: Automotive accessories, Vehicle modification

The short ram air intake is a form of aftermarket air intake for automobiles with internal combustion engines.
It replaces the OEM air intake with a short metal pipe and a conical air filter inside the engine bay. A significant increase in intake air volume will only occur in an engine where the factory intake piping was designed with baffles and other sound absorbing materials (rubber, etc.).
The term ram, albeit commonly used, is somewhat a misnomer.  A true ram air intake device is something that enhances intake pressure or in the case of resonant systems such as Chrysler's Sonaramic, increases the torque with a peak at a certain RPM.
There is still some open debate on this issue, but some believe that a problem with short ram air intakes is that the air entering the intake is at a higher temperature due to the proximity of the engine, which may reduce some power. This may be partially offset by an increase in the volume of air entering the engine. To counter intake heat problems, many short ram intakes include some form of heat shield. Moving the intake inlet port further away from the engine block will also help to alleviate the problem and some users use a cold air intake where the inlet air is at or close to ambient temperature.  However, others claim that Short Ram Intakes (SRIs) or similar Warm Air Intakes (WAIs) offer benefits over Cold Air Intakes (CAIs) which include better MPG due to a more complete burning of fuel. Users with forced induction engines often opt for short ram intakes because compressors adjacent to the engine, especially turbochargers, heat the incoming air and negate much of the benefits of a cold air intake. Additional problems can result from using a short ram intake in cars utilizing a mass airflow sensor though most of today's sensors automatically adjust without issue. Turbulence in the intake airflow produced by the filter or piping, or a change in intake diameter at the point where the airflow is measured can produce inaccurate airflow readings. The error in airflow then translates to an error in the amount of added fuel. In the worst case, the air/fuel ratio can run lean, causing detonation and possibly engine failure although the airflow sensor will generally detect and correct the throttle to compensate for the warmer air. This can also be solved by modifying/elongating the intake piping, replacing the airflow meter, or by replacing/remapping the engine control computer to provide the correct amount of fuel for the intake airflow at all engine speeds.
A harmless but noticeable result of using a short ram air intake is an increase in intake noise, which may manifest as a sucking sound, and the loss of any silencing properties that the factory intake had.

[[Continuous data protection]]

CATEGORIES: Computer data, Computer backup

Continuous data protection (CDP),  also called continuous backup or real-time backup, refers to backup of computer data by automatically saving a copy of every change made to that data, essentially capturing every version of the data that the user saves. It allows the user or administrator to restore data to any point in time.[tpl]cite web|last=Behtash |first=Behzad |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/services/disaster_recovery/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224700991 |title=Why Continuous Data Protection's Getting More Practical | work = Disaster recovery/business continuity |publisher=Informationweek |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/How-to-Use-Continuous-Data-Protection-to-Improve-Backup-Disaster-Recovery/ The technique was patented by British entrepreneur Pete Malcolm in 1989.US Patent 5086502  “A method of operating a data processing system” filed Nov 13, 1989.
CDP runs as a service that captures changes to data to a separate storage location. There are multiple methods for capturing the continuous changes involving different technologies that serve different needs. CDP-based solutions can provide fine granularities of restorable objects ranging from crash-consistent images to logical objects such as files, mail boxes, messages, and database files and logs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Continuous_Data_Protection.htm |title=An Overview of Continuous Data Protection |publisher=Infosectoday.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]

Charles Melville Hays (May 16, 1856 – April 15, 1912) was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway. He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway.  He became Vice-President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada. 
Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.
Hays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada.[tpl]cite web|title=Charles Melville Hays: Daring to Dream|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_RB_text_Hays.html|work=Canadian National History Railblazers|publisher=Canadian National Railway|accessdate=March 19, 2012[/tpl]   He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP.  He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS Titanic.

CATEGORIES: Mathematics-related lists, Knot theory, Outlines

Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone.  In precise mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3.  Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

[[Improved Touring]]
CATEGORIES: Sports Car Club of America

Improved Touring is a category of classifications for cars in amateur road racing defined by the Sports Car Club of America. The class is used by other sanctioning bodies with compatible rules, such as the International Conference of Sports Car Clubs.
The classifications within the Improved Touring group define cars that will run together competitively in a road race. While cars in different classifications may be on the track simultaneously, the only positioning that matters is between cars of the same classification.
The rules for the class include the General Competition Rules (GCR), a section of the SCCA rulebook that defines the basic setup and preparation for cars in any class of SCCA racing. Improved Touring cars are also subject to the rules in the Improved Touring Category Section (ITCS) of the rulebook, which define the specific classes and provide the class-specific rules.

CATEGORIES: Ships of the line of the Royal Navy, Chatham-built ships, 1805 ships

HMS ''Revenge'' was a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 13 April 1805. She was designed by Sir John Henslow as one of the large class 74s, and was the only ship built to her draught. As a large 74, she carried 24 pdrs on her upper gun deck, rather than the 18 pdrs found on the middling and common class 74s.
Newly commissioned, and captained by Robert Moorsom, she fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, where she sailed in Collingwood's column.
In October 1810, Revenge captured the French privateer cutter Vauteur off Cherbourg after a five-hour chase. Vauteur had been armed with 16 guns, but she threw 14 of them overboard during the chase. She had been out of Dieppe for 45 hours but had made no captures. She was the former British cutter John Bull, of Plymouth, and was restored to Plymouth on 19 October.Lloyd's List, 23 October 1810.http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1810/10-23-1810.jpg - accessed 10 November 2013.
Revenge served until 1842, being broken up in 1849. She was one of the first warships of the Royal Navy to be painted with the Nelson Checker.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]

[[Blind approach beacon system]]

CATEGORIES: World War II British electronics, Aeronautical navigation systems

A blind approach beacon system or beam approach beacon system (BABS) is an automatic radar landing system developed in the early 1940s.
It is a responder (or transponder) mounted in a Hillman van and placed at the end of the runway. In some cases fixed sites were installed and by the mid-1950s Standard 9 vans were in use. It was interrogated by a Rebecca unit mounted in an aircraft. It responded by transmitting dots on one side of the runway and dashes on the other. The strength of the reception in the aircraft depended on the aircraft's position relative to the centre line of the runway. The aircraft's equipment could then determine its position relative to these dots and dashes.
This is an early version of the localizer from the more modern instrument landing system (ILS). The localizer uses two tones (90 and 150Hz) modulated on a carrier (108-111.975 MHz) and transmitted on a wide aperture antenna array, this can be seen at almost all airports at the end of the runway. The strengths of which (or Difference in Depth of Modulation) are detected by electronics in the aircraft and present the pilot with an indication to fly left or right and indeed up or down with a co-located glidepath (328.6 to 335.4 MHz) equipment. See instrument landing system for further details.

Chemoprophylaxis refers to the administration of a medication for the purpose of preventing disease or infection. Antibiotics, for example, may be administered to patients with disorders of immune system function to prevent bacterial infections (particularly opportunistic infection). Antibiotics may also be administered to healthy individuals to limit the spread of an epidemic, or to patients who have repeated infections (such as urinary tract infections) to prevent recurrence.
In some cases, chemoprophylaxis is initiated to prevent the spread of an existing infection in an individual to a new organ system, as when intrathecal chemotherapy is administered in patients with malignancy to prevent further infection.
The use of chemoprophylaxis is limited primarily by two factors:  risk and financial costs.

[[Assembly (CLI)]]
CATEGORIES: Common Language Infrastructure

An assembly in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. There are two types: process assemblies (EXE) and library assemblies (DLL). A process assembly represents a process that will use classes defined in library assemblies. CLI assemblies contain code in CIL, which is usually generated from a CLI language, and then compiled into machine language at run time by the just-in-time compiler. In the .NET Framework implementation, this compiler is part of the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
An assembly can consist of one or more files. Code files are called modules. An assembly can contain more than one code module. And since it is possible to use different languages to create code modules, it is technically possible to use several different languages to create an assembly. Visual Studio however does not support using different languages in one assembly.

The Racquet Club of Philadelphia (RCOP) is a private social club and athletic club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It has facilities for squash, real tennis, and racquets.
Established in 1889, the club started its life in a modest facility at 923 Walnut Street. Under the leadership of George D. Widener, the current 16th Street Clubhouse was built by noted architect Horace Trumbauer. Historian Nathaniel Burt described the new 1907 Clubhouse as "by far the best appointed...of all Philadelphia clubs."Nathaniel Burt, Perennial Philadelphians: The Anatomy of an American Aristocracy, Little, Brown and Company, 1963 (reprinted 1999), p. 268 The clubhouse is one of the first reinforced concrete structures designed in Philadelphia, and also includes the world's first above grade swimming pool, designed by the noted bridge builders Roebling Construction Company. The building's red-brick, Georgian design, is evocative of historic Philadelphia, and the Clubhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
The club was the site of the invention of squash doubles by Frederich C. Tompkins.  The new building had a space that was too large for a standard squash court but too small for further locker facilities and Tomkins recommended that it be used for squash doubles.History of the Sport of Doubles Squash CanadaOrigin of Doubles Part 1 squashtalk.com
The Racquet Club's athletic facilities include 3 international squash singles courts, 1 squash doubles court, a real tennis court, a racquets court, and a fitness facility. The club also has overnight rooms for the use of members and sponsored guests, as well as a bar and serves lunch daily. The club is open to members 365 days a year. Located on 16th Street between Walnut and Locust, it is in the heart of Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square area.
The club has hosted several international real tennis, racquets, and doubles squash tournaments and championships.  It was once home to multiple national amateur U.S. champion Morris Clothier and national and world champion Jay Gould II.
The U.S. Squash Hall of Fame was briefly at the club until moving to Yale University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ussquash.com/functions/content.aspx?id=1366|title=Hall of Fame & Museum|publisher=U.S. Squash|accessdate=2 March 2010[/tpl]

One of the important success stories of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm is the decoding of capacity-approaching error-correcting codes, such as LDPC and turbo codes.
A factor graph is an example of a hypergraph, in that an arrow (i.e., a factor node) can connect more than one (normal) node.
When there are no free variables, the factor graph of a function f is equivalent to the constraint graph of f, which is an instance to a constraint satisfaction problem.

[[Chemical imbalance]]

CATEGORIES: Aetiology of psychiatric disorders, Neuroscience, Psychoactive drugs

Chemical imbalance is one hypothesis about the cause of mental illness. Other causes that are debated include psychological and social causes.
The basic concept is that neurotransmitter imbalances within the brain are the main causes of psychiatric conditions and that these conditions can be improved with medication which corrects these imbalances. The phrase originated from the scientific study of brain chemistry. In the 1950s the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants were accidentally discovered to be effective in the treatment of clinical depression.Drugs and the Brain: Antidepressants
These findings and other supporting evidence led scientist Joseph J. Schildkraut (1934–2006) to publish his paper called "The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders" in 1965.The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence. 1965 article - Schildkraut 7 (4)  524 - J Neuropsychiatry Clin NeurosciJoseph J. Schildkraut obituary, New York Times (July 8, 2006) Schildkraut associated low levels of neurotransmitters with depression.
Research into other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia also found that too much activity of certain neurotransmitters such as dopamine was correlated to these disorders. In the scientific community this hypothesis has been referred to as the "Monoamine hypothesis". This hypothesis has been a major focus of research in the fields pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy for over 25 yearsJohan A Den Boer: Looking Beyond the Monoamine Hypothesis. European Neurological Review, 2006;6(1):87-92 and led to the development of new classes of drugs such as SSRIs (selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors).Mental Illness - GSU Biology 4102 / 6102
This conceptual framework has been challenged within the scientific community, though no other demonstrably superior hypothesis has emerged. While the hypothesis has been shown to be simplistic and lacking, there is sufficient evidence to consider it as a useful heuristic in the aiding of our understanding of brain chemistry and explaining pharmacotherapy.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schildkraut | title = The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders: A review of Supporting Evidence | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=150108 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 122 | issue = 5| page = 509 [/tpl]
Wayne Goodman, Chair of the US Food and Drug Administration Psychopharmacological Advisory Committee, has described the serotonergic theory of depression as a "useful metaphor" for understanding depression, though not one that he uses with his own psychiatric patients.Television adverts for antidepressants cause anxiety, from New Scientist. Published November 12, 2005; accessed November 17, 2007. Recently, psychiatrist Peter Kramer stated that the serotonin theory of depression had been declared dead prematurely.http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/200804/the-chemical-imbalance-theory-dead-or-alive The "Chemical Imbalance" Theory: Dead or Alive? Kramer argues that recent scientific research actually shows a definitive role for serotonin deficiency in depression. An analysis of the studies Kramer cites argues that such statements are premature.http://chemicalimbalance.org/?p=6 Is Clinical Depression Caused by a Serotonin Imbalance?

The NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship was the secondary singles championship in the National Wrestling Alliance's St. Louis Wrestling Club and Central States Wrestling promotions in the 1970s and 1980s. It was usually dominated by the area's top star, Harley Race, and as such it was considered a "stepping stone" to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (although only Race, Terry Funk, Kerry Von Erich and Ric Flair made it; Gene Kiniski and Dory Funk, Jr. were already former World Champions upon winning the Missouri title). 
Previous versions existed in 1899, 1921, 1933 to 1934, 1937, 1947, 1950, and 1954 to 1955, but it was only in 1972 that a serious championship was established. It was shelved in 1986, as the Central States promotion was being consolidated under Jim Crockett Promotions in order to counter the World Wrestling Federation's national expansion. NWA Midwest revived the title in 2002 and it existed until 2012.  NWA Central-States Championship Wrestling (CCW) crowned a new champion on March 29th, 2014.

[[Overseas country of France]]
CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of France

Overseas country is the new designation for the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia. French Polynesia was formerly an overseas territory until the constitutional reform on 28 March 2003 created the overseas collectivities. Then, on 27 February 2004 a law was passed giving French Polynesia the particular designation of overseas country while recalling that it belongs to the category of overseas collectivity. However, the Constitutional Council of France ruled that this description was merely a designation and not a legal status, as that would have been unconstitutional.
The territory's new status meant a certain autonomy for French Polynesia in the Pacific region which translated into the transfer of new areas of legal responsibility (civil law, commercial law, labour law) while protecting its autonomy regarding health, development and
town planning and the environment. In addition, they now have the power to oppose the application in French Polynesia of laws voted by the French Parliament which do not respect these areas of responsibility. Furthermore, it established French Polynesian citizenship based on permanent residency, which is a requirement for the right to vote in regional elections. However, France maintains control over justice, security and public order, currency, defence, and foreign policy.
New Caledonia, which has the unique status of a sui generis collectivity, is also sometimes incorrectly referred to as an overseas country. However, if the people of New Caledonia choose to remain part of France in a referendum on independence scheduled for 2014 or later, the community may become an overseas country.

[[The Speech]]

CATEGORIES: Young Wizards, Fictional languages

The Speech is an idealized language found throughout modern fantasy/science fiction. It is considered a central language, the root of all tongues, and in some cases the true describing words that made the universe. Unifying characteristics of this language in many books include:
A popular example of this is used in the Young Wizards series of novels by Diane Duane.  All creatures and things understand and, to a degree, can speak the Speech intuitively, but specifically, it is the wizards who use it as their primary language and means of performing their works of magic.  It is incredibly detailed and describes things which other languages cannot.  Describing something inaccurately in the Speech may result in catastrophic effect (including changing the nature of the thing or being therein mis-described); therefore, wizards are advised to never curse or lie in the Speech.  Spells are described in the Speech; the wizard tells the object/subject what he/she wants to happen to it.  With a final word, the spell can be let loose to do what it was supposed to do.
Letters written in the Speech have been described in several of the books as Arabic-seeming in nature. In Deep Wizardry, Nita's father mistakes the writing on the title page of Nita's Manual for Arabic letters.
Other examples include the Pellinor series by Alison Croggon, in which the Bards of the land, magic users and Light bringers, use the Speech, and Christopher Paolini's Eragon, Eldest and Brisingr, in which a dead language called the Ancient Language is used for spellcasting and by elves.

[[Workweek and weekend]]

CATEGORIES: Working time, Weeks, Labor rights, Labour relations, Labor history

The workweek and weekend are those complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively.  The legal working week (British English), or workweek (U.S. English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labour. In most Western countries it is Monday to Friday; the weekend is a time period including Saturday and Sunday. Some people extend the weekend to Friday nights as well. In some Christian traditions, Sunday is the "Lord's Day" and the day of rest and worship. Jewish Shabbat or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday, leading to a Friday-Saturday weekend in Israel. Muslim-majority countries usually have a Thursday-Friday or Friday-Saturday weekend. The French Revolutionary Calendar had ten-day weeks (called décades) and allowed décadi, one out of the ten days, as a leisure day.
The present-day concept of the weekend first arose from the Dies Solis (Day of the Sun) decreed by Emperor Constantine and from the Biblical Sabbath.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  The Christian Sabbath itself was just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the twentieth century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, following changes in employer expectations. Proposals have continued to be put forward for further reductions in the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.

[[Sci-Fi SKANE]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish musical groups

Sci-Fi SKANE is a musical collaboration of Swedish musicians Thomas Öberg and Jonas Jonasson, members of Swedish rock groups bob hund and Bergman Rock.
 Sci-Fi SKANE was started in 2005, and the goal was stated as being to "create stupidity and dance". 
The word SKANE in the name is regarded as an ironic anglification of Skåne, the area the band originates from.
Sci-fi SKANE's musical style is of the same nature as bob hund's and Bergman Rock's style, but without live drums, and dominated by keyboards and programmed sounds. However, the somewhat ironic tone known from bob hund and Bergman Rock is present both in the music and in the lyrics.
So far Sci-Fi SKANE has released two singles: a cover of Canned Heat's "Going Up The Country" called "Jag har aldrig bott vid en landsväg" and another song called "Vi kommer försent till bluesen". 
The duo's debut album Känslan av att jorden krymper växer (roughly translated: The feeling that the Earth is shrinking is growing/increases) was to be released in Sweden by Silence Records on November 16, 2005, but due to errors in the printing of its phosphorescent cover, the release was delayed.

CATEGORIES: Musical groups established in 1982, Musical groups disestablished in 1986, American New Wave musical groups, Trent Reznor

Option 30 was a new wave band from the early 1980s founded by Timothy K. ("TK") Smith on guitars and vocals, Jim Nordstrom on bass and saxophone, and Todd Nero on drums. The band also featured a young Trent Reznor on keyboards and lead vocals.
Option 30's style was similar to that of Falco and early albums by The Police. The band managed to record one demo (see below) before Reznor left for The Innocent then onto Exotic Birds and finally, forming his own band, Nine Inch Nails. The demo was shelved until after the success of Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, when it was re-released.
The band performed at clubs in and around Northwestern and Central Pennsylvania, and Northern Ohio as often as three times a week.  After Reznor departed, the band continued on as a power trio with Smith on lead vocals.  At this point, the band began performing a number of additional original songs penned by Smith and Nordstrom.  Option 30 broke up in 1986.

[[C-sharp major]]

CATEGORIES: Musical keys, Major scales

C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] major (or C-sharp major) is a major scale based on C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], consisting of the pitches C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], D[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], E[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], G[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], and B[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]. Its key signature has seven sharps (see below: Scales and keys).
Its relative minor is A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] minor, and its parallel minor is C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl] minor. Its enharmonic equivalent is D[tpl]music|flat[/tpl] major.
A harp tuned to C-sharp major has all its pedals in the bottom position. Because all the strings are then pinched and shortened, this is the least resonant key for the instrument.
Although most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D-flat major because it has just five flats as opposed to the seven sharps of C-sharp major, Johann Sebastian Bach chose C-sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier. In Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6, Franz Liszt takes the unusual step of changing key from D-flat major to C-sharp major near the beginning of the piece. Maurice Ravel selected C-sharp major as the tonic key of Ondine from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit.  Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, Op. 17, in the key of C-sharp major.
Louis Vierne used C-sharp major for the "Dona Nobis Pacem" of the Agnus Dei of his Messe Solennelle in C sharp minor.

[[Jimmy Sangster]]

CATEGORIES: 1927 births, 2011 deaths, English film directors, English screenwriters, Hammer Film Productions

James Henry Kinmel Sangster (2 December 1927 – 19 August 2011) was a Welsh screenwriter and director, known for his work for horror film producers Hammer Film Productions, including scripts for The Curse of Frankenstein (the first British horror movie to be shot in colour) and Dracula (US: Horror of Dracula).http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8745357/Jimmy-Sangster.html
Sangster originally worked as a production assistant at the studio, as well as assistant director, second unit director and production manager. After Hammer Films Productions' success with The Quatermass Xperiment, Sangster was approached to write The Curse of Frankenstein, to which he said, "I'm not a writer. I'm a production manager."  According to Sangster, Hammer Films' response was, "Well, you come up with a couple of ideas and if we like it, we'll pay you. If we don't like it, we won't pay you. You're being paid as a production manager, so you can't complain." He later turned to direction with The Horror of Frankenstein and Lust for a Vampire (both 1970) for the studio, but with far less success. His third (and last) film as director was 1972's Fear in the Night, which resurrected the psychological woman-in-peril thriller Sangster had begun with his script for Taste of Fear in 1961. All three of these films featured actor Ralph Bates, one of Hammer's best-known actors of the latter period of the company. 
Sangster scripted and produced two films for Bette Davis, The Nanny (1965) and The Anniversary (1968).
Other scriptwriting credits included The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) which starred Donald Sinden and in which Sangster appeared as Winston Churchill.
He is survived by his third wife, the actress Mary Peach and by a son from an earlier marriage, Mark James Sangster http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8745357/Jimmy-Sangster.html and two grandchildren, Claire and Ian Sangster.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]

Michèle Le Dœuff (born 1948) is a French philosopher with a scholarly interest in the philosophy of Francis Bacon, and Sir Thomas More's utopianism. She questions the boundaries of philosophy, while insisting upon philosophy's importance (for example, in "Ants and Women"). She is critical of professional philosophers' neglectful attitude to science, and argues that disputes within sciences are often epistemological (that is, properly philosophical). In Hipparchia's Choice (1989) she questions philosophy's pretensions to being a unique practice which achieves a pure clarity: philosophy is inevitably shaped by language, metaphor, and power relations. According to Le Dœuff feminists make a special contribution. Their critique of gender categories in philosophy, science, and the humanities is empirical, philosophical, political, and interdisciplinary. Feminists see clearly how discourses are elevated to the status of 'philosophical' by a process in which social power is involved.Frazer 2005. p. 508.

The Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir (also known as the Stade Olympique de Colombes, or simply Colombes to the locals) is a rugby, track and association football stadium in Colombes, near Paris, France.  Named in memory of French rugby player Yves du Manoir in 1928, it was the main stadium for the 1924 Summer Olympics and had a capacity of 45,000 at the time.1924 Olympics official report. pp. 50–5, 96, 121, 152, 216, 222, 238, 248, 318, 339, 375, 499, 503, 536. [tpl]fr icon[/tpl] During the 1924 games, it hosted the athletics, some of the cycling, some of the horse riding, gymnastics, tennis, some of the football, rugby, and two of the modern pentathlon events (running, fencing). It was later expanded to a capacity of over 60,000. Colombes was also the venue for the 1938 World Cup Final between Italy and Hungary.
Colombes hosted a number of French Cup finals and home games of the French national football and rugby union teams into the 1970s. It remained the country's largest stadium until the renovated Parc des Princes was inaugurated in 1972. By that time, Colombes' capacity had dropped to under 50,000 due to more stringent safety regulations. The national rugby union team played its last game at Colombes in 1972, and the national football team last played there in 1975.
French professional football team RC Paris used Colombes as their home ground until 1985 or so, then moved on to other stadia before coming back in the 2000s.
Racing Métro 92 rugby club have never left. They originally planned to redevelop Yves-du-Manoir into a 15,000-seat stadium to be shared with Racing Club de France football Colombes 92, but have since decided to build a completely new stadium, tentatively known as Arena 92, in nearby Nanterre. It remains to be seen whether the Racing Club Paris football club will move as well.
The stadium was portrayed in the film Escape to Victory starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine, but the stand-stadium used in the filming was the Hidegkuti Nándor Stadion in Budapest, Hungary.

An event consists of a group of supposed shoppers who congregate at a large superstore (usually a Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, Asda, or Sainsbury's) and slowly push empty shopping carts silently through store aisles. Participants will not purchase anything and seek to form a lengthy chain of non-shoppers, continually weaving and "whirling" through a maze of store aisles for up to an hour at a time. Participants describe their actions as "a collective reclamation of space that is otherwise only used for buying and selling". Whirl-Marters seek to mimic and mock what they perceive as the absurdity of the shopping process.

[[Grip strength]]
CATEGORIES: Climbing, Weight training

Grip strength is the force applied by the hand to pull on or suspend from objects and is a specific part of hand strength. Optimum-sized objects permit the hand to wrap around a cylindrical shape with a diameter from one to three inches. Stair rails are an example of where shape and diameter are critical for proper grip in case of a fall. Other grip strengths that have been studied are the hammer and other hand tools. In applications of grip strength, the wrist must be in a neutral position to avoid developing cumulative trauma disorders (CTD's).
Grip strength is a general term also used by strength athletes, referring to the muscular power and force that they can generate with their hands.  In athletics, it is critical for rock climbers and in competitions such as the World's Strongest Man.  Grip strength training is also a major feature in martial arts, and can be useful in various professions where people must work with their hands.

Nolo, formerly known as Nolo Press, is a publisher in Berkeley, California, that produces do-it-yourself legal books and software that reduce the need for people to hire lawyers for simple legal matters such as making wills or writing business partnership contracts. In 2011, the company was purchased by Internet Brands, Inc.[tpl]cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Bridget |date=May 3, 2011 |title=Nolo Acquired by New Media Company Internet Brands |work=Publishers Weekly |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/47074-nolo-acquired-by-new-media-company-internet-brands.html |accessdate= [/tpl]
The company was founded in an attic in 1971 by Ralph Warner (who received his bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1963 and his degree in law from the Boalt School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley) and family law attorney Ed Sherman. The company published Sherman's first book, How to Do Your Own Divorce in California, after they discovered that other publishers wouldn't (fearing prosecution for practicing law without a law licence). [tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], Warner remains associated with Nolo, though he relinquished day-to-day control following the company's sale to Internet Brands in 2011.Nolo.com staff biography of Ralph Warner Sherman founded his own legal publishing business, Nolo Press Occidental, a separate company from Nolo.com.Nolo Press Occidental corporate history webpage
The company's name is derived from the legal phrase Nolo contendere, meaning "it will not be disputed" or "I choose not to dispute". The word "nolo" itself could be taken to mean "I will not", "I choose not", or "I would prefer not to". The company recommends getting professional legal help for disputable or difficult matters.
The company's logo shows the scales of justice tilted (in the favor of the reader). Some older Nolo publications feature an unofficial mascot, a shark depicted wearing a necktie and carrying a briefcase – showing the company's fondness for poking fun at their fellow members of the legal profession. This mascot was often accompanied by the motto "Don't feed the lawyers. Just say Nolo."[tpl]cite news |author=Doreen Carvajal |title=Lawyers Are Not Amused By Feisty Legal Publisher |date=August 24, 1998 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 8, 2013[/tpl]

In 2006, Nolo began publishing a directory of attorneys, which is asserted to operate on the principle that both participating lawyers and consumers are better served by a relatively short list of qualified attorneys under each category (business law, real estate, etc.), with lots of information for side-by-side comparisons.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

It contains information about ISA PnP devices is stored. It's used by the BIOS to allocate resources for devices like expansion cards. The ESCD data is stored using the data serialization format used for EISA. Its data starts with the "ACFG" signature in ASCII. PCI configuration can also be stored in ESCD, using virtual slots.ESCD specification 1.02A, Appendix A, pp. 21-22 Typical storage usage for ESCD data is 2–4 KB
The BIOS also updates the ESCD each time the hardware configuration changes, after deciding how to re-allocate resources like IRQ and memory mapping ranges. After the ESCD has been updated, the decision need not be made again, which thereafter results in faster startup without conflicts until the next hardware configuration change.

The 10th SS Panzer Division ''Frundsberg or '10.SS-Panzer-Division Frundsberg''' was a German Waffen SS panzer division. The division was formed at the beginning of 1943 as a reserve for the expected Allied invasion of France. However, their first campaign was in the Ukraine in April 1944. Highly motivated after combat success in the Ukraine, the unit was then transported back to the west, where it fought the Allies in France and at Arnhem. The division was later transported to Pomerania, then fought south east of Berlin in the Lausitz area until the end of the war. Unlike several of the earlier SS panzer divisions, the "Frundsberg" division did not engage in atrocities against either civilians or combatants. Based on its fighting record, it was an elite division that also had a reputation of fighting a "clean war." Postwar, the division had a very active veteran's association.

Code Access Security (CAS), in the Microsoft .NET framework, is Microsoft's solution to prevent untrusted code from performing privileged actions. When the CLR loads an assembly it will obtain evidence for the assembly and use this to identify the code group that the assembly belongs to. A code group contains a permission set (one or more permissions). Code that performs a privileged action will perform a code access demand which will cause the CLR to walk up the call stack and examine the permission set granted to the assembly of each method in the call stack. 
The code groups and permission sets are determined by the administrator of the machine who defines the security policy.

[[Jolly Farmer]]
CATEGORIES: Transport in Surrey, Camberley, Roundabouts in England

The Jolly Farmer is a roundabout on the A30 (London Road) between Camberley and Bagshot in Surrey, UK.
Origins of the Jolly Farmer name date to the late 17th century when there was a highwayman called William Davies who worked on Bagshot Heath and allegedly only took gold from his victims. His identity was discovered since he was a local farmer who only paid his taxes in gold. A picture of him was painted and hung in the Golden Farmer pub along the London Road. One day however it was remarked that the golden farmer looked more jolly than golden, so the pub changed its name and was henceforth known as the Jolly Farmer.
Davies is said to have been hung at the adjacent hill now called Gibbet Lane.
The Jolly Farmer roundabout used to be home to a pub called the Jolly Farmer, which subsequently changed ownership and was re-branded as the Mongolian Barbecue. This has now ceased trading, and fast-food restaurant chain Burger King made a bid to buy the roundabout.  Following a safety campaign, the council rejected this offer. Today, the Jolly Farmer roundabout contains the "American Discount Golf Store".

Elisabeth of the Palatinate (26 December 1618 – 11 February 1680), also known as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate, or Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey, was known for her intelligent and caring nature. She was the eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was briefly King of Bohemia, and Elizabeth Stuart. She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, spending the first nine years of her life there. When she was nine, she went to live in Leyden, Holland with her brother and was raised in a nursery palace to complete her studies. After finishing her studies, she was deemed ready to live in The Hague with her mother. Elisabeth was sent back to live in Germany and then eventually took her vows in a Protestant convent at  Herford Abbey in Westphalia as Princess-Abbess. She influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably René Descartes. During her days as head of the Abbey, she provided refuge for many Protestants during a time of great persecution. She is most famous for questioning Descartes' idea of Dualism, or the mind being separate from the body, in addition to questioning his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. The written correspondence of Descartes and Elisabeth is now revered as important philosophical documents, giving insight into the theoretical debates of the 17th century. Elisabeth died in 1680 after suffering from a painful illness for several years.

Sharpen Your Teeth is an album by the indie rock band Ugly Casanova. Brainchild of Modest Mouse lead singer Isaac Brock, Ugly Casanova was his attempt to try new methods and genres outside the realms of Modest Mouse. The album sees Brock performing on more instruments and using a more stripped down method of recording. The story given is that an eccentric character named Edgar Graham met with Modest Mouse while on tour. During their time together, Graham and the band recorded a few songs together, and Graham completely disappeared. In an attempt to get Graham to resurface, Brock took the recordings to Sub Pop Records, redid them in the studio, and had them released as Sharpen Your Teeth. A follow-up is highly unlikely due to contractual obligations Brock has with Modest Mouse's label Epic Records. It has since been revealed that Brock fabricated the story himself, using Ugly Casanova as a method of writing music whilst not being recognized instantly as Modest Mouse.

[[Jaguar (Archie Comics)]]

CATEGORIES: Archie Comics superheroes, Comics characters introduced in 1961, DC Comics superheroes, Fictional characters with superhuman strength, Fictional telepaths, Jungle superheroes, Jungle men

The Jaguar is a superhero published by Archie Comics.  He was created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger as part of Archie's "Archie Adventure Series", before that line was camped up as part of their Mighty Comics line.  He would actually appear two years after The Fly did.
The Jaguar is actually zoologist Ralph Hardy.  While on a dig in Peru (Hardy, like most Silver Age heroes, was a man of many interests and talents including archeology), a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. While the others fled Hardy followed a rare white jaguar into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster as well as a mystical "nucleon energy belt".  The buckle of the belt had an inscription: "He who loves the animal kingdom may wear this belt and be transformed into a human jaguar." Hardy put on the belt and instantly transformed into the Jaguar.
As the Jaguar he possessed, in addition to the expected feline abilities, all the powers of the animal kingdom only a thousand times more powerful (the oft-quoted magnified toughness of a rhinoceros' hide, for example, gave him near Superman level invulnerability), plus he had the Aquaman-style telepathic ability to mentally communicate with and command all animals including those from alien worlds.  
As the Jaguar, he wore a simple skintight scarlet bodysuit with a flared black collar and the stylized suggestion of a feline face (just the eyes, whiskers and open mouth) on the chest and jaguar pelt-patterned boots and nucleon belt, the later with two small rocket packs on either side which gave him the power of supersonic flight.  The Jaguar wore no mask and looked exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy had a mustache and the Jaguar didn't.  
In many ways, the Jaguar was a copy of the Fly: magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than insect kingdom, etc.
Unlike the Fly, however, the handsome Jaguar had many recurring romantic interests, including the immortal feline sorceress Cat Girl who had command over the cat kingdom just as he ruled over the entire animal kingdom (also known as the Sphinx, she originally had fought the Fly, but it was quickly realized that she would make a more fitting foe for the Jaguar), the green-skinned and white-haired undersea siren Kree-Nal, and Hardy's secretary Jill Ross who, like Pete Ross, secretly knew that Hardy was her beloved hero the Jaguar and used that knowledge to help him without him knowing it.  Nor were these relationships static for in later stories Jill left to study to become a nurse so that she could better assist Hardy in the veterinary side of his work, and Cat Girl lost her magic powers due to exposure to Strontium 90 radiation from atomic testing, retaining only her telepathic mastery over cats as she took on the new mortal identity of jet-set socialite Lydia Fellin whose "family fortune" was actually the vast treasure trove that she had gathered over the centuries.
The Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of The Adventures of the Jaguar, as well as backup stories in several other Archie comics (Jughead Jones Comic Digest 7; Laugh Comics 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140-142, 144; Laugh Comics Digest 25, 27; Pep Comics 150, 152, 157, 159, 168), and would show up in The Adventures of the Fly #23.  When the "Archie Adventure Series" line was canceled and camped up as Archie's Mighty Comics line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in Mighty Crusaders #4 and 5.  In #5, The Jaguar would team up with Mr. Justice and Steel Sterling as the "Terrific Three".
The Jaguar would again appear as part of Archie's Red Circle Comics revamp in the 1980s, as a founding member of the new Mighty Crusaders, and get a backup series in The Fly (issues 4-9).  In this incarnation it was revealed that the source of the Jaguar's powers was the pre-human god Varigon, Lord of the Animals, a towering golden-winged being with the three heads of a bird, lion and bull who had created the magic belt as a weapon to be worn by his mortal champion in his eternal battle against the scaly green lizard-headed S'ithh, Lord of the Reptiles who wanted the dinosaurs to rule the Earth once more and that the first person to have worn the belt in ancient times had been an Incan woman.
The most recent appearances of the Ralph Hardy Jaguar have been in cameos in Archie's Weird Mysteries #3 and 14 and a cover story crossover appearance in Sabrina the Teenage Witch # 30.
A teenage female version of the Jaguar, written by William Messner-Loebs, was used in DC Comics' Impact revamp of the Archie superheroes. She was naive and good-hearted Maria DeGuzman who came to North America from Rio de Janeiro to study at Elm Harbor University when to her surprise she inherited from her late aunt the werewolf-like ability to transform into the large, muscular, barefoot and green-eyed Jaguar.  Unlike her male namesake, however, in this ferocious feline form her powers were limited to superhuman strength and agility combined with cat-like claws and senses.  She eventually "married" the Impact version of the Fly at the end of the Crucible mini-series.
In the aftermath of the continuity-altering Final Crisis, DC comics once again licensed the Red Circle heroes, this time choosing to bring them directly into the DC Universe. In March 2010, a new Jaguar is set to appear in The  Shield #5 and is apparently a Brazilian male who can transform into a red tattoo-covered were-jaguar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2009/12/18/editor-rachel-gluckstern-on-the-next-wave-of-red-circle-characters/ |title=DC Universe: The Source » Blog Archive » Editor Rachel Gluckstern on the next wave of Red Circle characters |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-12-27[/tpl]
In New Crusaders, the role of the Jaguar was passed to Ralph Hardy's young apprentice, orphan Yvette "Ivy" Velez. She was given the helmet of Ai Apaec to become the new Jaguar.

Ministry for Refugees, Immigrants and Integration of Denmark ([tpl]lang-da|Ministeriet for flygtninge, indvandrere og integration[/tpl]) was a Danish ministerial office, often abbreviated as "Ministry for Integration" ([tpl]lang-da|Integrationsminister[/tpl]). The office was created by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen on 27 November 2001 when he formed the Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I after the 2001 Danish parliamentary election, in which  refugees, immigration, and integration of people from non-western countries had been important issues.
One of the stated goals of the Anders Fogh cabinet, and especially the supporting Danish People's Party which secured the government's majority, was to "stem the flow" of refugees to Denmark, and new tougher rules did drastically reduce the number of refugees being granted asylum. Another initiative was the 24 year rule, which stated that husbands/wives must be 24 or older before they could immigrate to Denmark through family reunification (there had been many cases of arranged marriages of young people being used to get around immigration restrictions).
It was abolished by the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt after Rasmussen's right-wing alliance lost the 2011 election.

One of the engine's most notable features was out-of-the-box support for hardware-accelerated graphics, specifically OpenGL, along with the traditional software renderer.
Another interesting feature was the subdivision of some of the components into dynamic-link libraries. This allowed both software and OpenGL renderers, which were switched between by loading and unloading separate libraries.
Libraries were also used for the game logic, for two reasons:
The level format, as with previous id Software engines, used BSP. The levels were lit through a lightmap method, in which light data for each surface is precalculated (this time, via a radiosity method) and stored as an image in the level file, which is then used to determine how much lighting intensity each model should receive, but not its direction.

Denis Richards (10 September 1910 – 25 November 2004) was a British historian. He is famous for his work on the history of the Royal Air Force, including the three-volume official history of the service during World War II, which was co-written with Hilary St. George Saunders.
Richards came from London and was educated at Owen's School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1931 he graduated from Cambridge University with a double first in history. For the next eight years he was a master at Manchester Grammar School, teaching both history and English. From 1939 to 1941 he taught the same subjects at Bradfield College, near Reading, as a senior tutor.
War service then called him and he joined the RAF. Within a very short time he was ordered to report to the historical section of the Air Ministry. His staff eventually came to number 40, and he held the position of senior narrator from 1943 to 1947. He began to write the official history of the RAF during World War II when he was the senior narrator. It was eventually published in three volumes in 1953 and 1954. In 1947 he was promoted within the Air Ministry to a principal, a post in which he remained until 1950.
After his time in the RAF, and whilst completing the official history, he became involved with Morley College in south London. He worked strenuously to raise funds for the rebuilding of the institution. The college benefitted from paintings he commissioned, and many young musicians later to find fame, took part in concerts he staged.
He had a number of hobbies, including snooker and golf. He was heavily involved with Hampstead Golf Club after joining it in 1951. He also engaged in voluntary work, chairing the Women's League for Health and Beauty for 22 years between 1966 and 1988 and also acting as a vice president of the Purcell School of Young Musicians from 1984 until his death. He continued to publish works into his old age, and he was awarded the OBE in 1990.

(Eventually she returned to a more conventional armament.) She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, and then as a transport for convicts to Australia. She then returned to naval service in the Mediterranean. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Admiralty converted her to a water depot at Sheerness. In 1830 the Admiralty converted Glatton'' to a breakwater and sank her at Harwich.

[[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change policy, Environmentalism, Political statements, 1992 in the environment, Science activism

In late 1992, the late Henry W. Kendall, a former chair of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) board of directors, wrote "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity", which begins: "Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course." A majority of the Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences signed the document;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ucs-statement.txt |title=Textfile containing the Warning and a list of selected signatories |publisher=stanford.edu |accessdate=2011-08-26[/tpl] (Archived by WebCite® at http://www.webcitation.org/61DcmWeQM) about 1,700 of the world's leading scientists appended their signature.
It is sometimes offered in opposition to the Heidelberg Appeal—also signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992—which begins by criticizing "an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress, and impedes economic and social development." This document is often cited by those who oppose theories relating to climate change.
However, the Heidelberg Appeal offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of environmental science: "We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved. But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions."
In contrast, the UCS-led petition contains specific recommendations: "We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water.  ...  We must stabilize population."

The Fujiwhara effect, sometimes referred to as Fujiwara interaction or binary interaction, is when two nearby cyclonic vortices orbit each other and close the distance between the circulations of their corresponding low-pressure areas. The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described the effect.  Binary interaction of smaller circulations can cause the development of a larger cyclone, or cause two cyclones to merge into one.

Nakasuk (Inuktitut syllabics: ᓇᑲᓱᒃ[tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl]) was an Inuk who was born at a sealing camp near Pangnirtung, Nunavut in the early 20th century and grew up around Kimmirut (formerly Lake Harbour).  He assisted a US Navy party wintering on Baffin Island during the 1941-1942 winter to find a suitable location for a US air base.  During World War II, the United States constructed a chain of airfields connecting the United States to the United Kingdom via Arctic Canada, Greenland and Iceland.  (See DEW Line.)
The site they selected is the location of the modern community of Iqaluit.  Nakasuk remained at the site to assist the Americans in establishing their base, and settled there permanently after its completion, becoming Iqaluit's first permanent resident.  He is therefore remembered as the founder of Iqaluit, and Nakasuk Elementary School  is named in his honour.
His name means "bladder" in Inuktitut.

The former harbour town of the Cham at the estuary of the Thu Bồn River was an important Vietnamese trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries, where Chinese from various provinces as well as Japanese, Dutch and Indians settled. During this period of the China trade, the town was called Hai Pho (Seaside Town) in Vietnamese. Originally, Hai Pho was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the "Japanese Bridge" (16th-17th century).

[[Walkout]]
CATEGORIES: Labor disputes

In labor disputes, a walkout is a labor strike, the act of employees collectively leaving the workplace as an act of protest.
A walkout can also mean the act of leaving a place of work, school, a meeting, a company, or an organization, especially if meant as an expression of protest or disapproval.
A walkout can be seen as different from a strike in that a walkout can occur spontaneously, and need not necessarily involve all the workers present, whereas a strike is often voted on beforehand by the workers, giving notification both to all of the workers and to the company affected.
Walkouts have often been staged against the presence of a speaker or the content of an in-progress speech at a meeting. The protest, which is often a silent, non-violent means of expressing disapproval, is often interpreted as an exercise of the freedom of association while allowing the speaker to exercise the freedom of speech, albeit with a reduced audience in attendance.

This locomotive and the SD45T-2 are popularly called tunnel motors, but EMD's term is SD40-2s with "cooling system modifications" because they were designed for better engine cooling in tunnels. The difference between this locomotive and its non-tunnel motor cousin, the SD40-2, are the radiator intakes and radiator fan grills located at the rear of the locomotive. The radiator air intakes in this model were along the deck to allow more fresh, cooler air to enter and less hot exhaust fumes lingering around the tunnel's ceiling. thumb|EMD SD45T-2 vs SD40T-2 radiator fan motor access doors
This locomotive model was purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad, its subsidiary Cotton Belt, and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Southern Pacific's version has a [tpl]Convert|4400|usgal|l|adj=on|sigfig=3[/tpl] fuel tank and is [tpl]Convert|70|ft|8|in[/tpl] long.

James Curley (Irish: Séamus MacThoirealaigh 26 October 1796 – 24 July 1889) was an Irish-American astronomer.
He was born at Athleague, County Roscommon, Ireland. His early education was limited, though his talent for mathematics was discovered, and to some extent developed, by a teacher in his native town. He left Ireland in his youth, arriving in Philadelphia on 10 October 1817. Here he worked for two years as a bookkeeper and then taught mathematics at Frederick, Maryland.
In 1826 he became a student at the old seminary in Washington, DC, intending to prepare himself for the Catholic priesthood, and at the same time taught one of its classes. The seminary, however, which had been established in 1820, was closed in the following year and he joined the Society of Jesus on 29 September 1827. After completing his novitiate he again taught in Frederick and was sent in 1831 to teach natural philosophy at Georgetown University. He also studied theology and was ordained priest on 1 June 1833. His first Mass was said at the Visitation Convent, Georgetown, where he afterwards acted as chaplain for fifty years.
He spent the remainder of his life at Georgetown, where he taught natural philosophy and mathematics for forty-eight years. He planned and superintended the building of the Georgetown Observatory in 1844 and was its first director, filling this position for many years. One of his earliest achievements was the determination of the latitude and longitude of Washington, D.C. in 1846. His results did not agree with those obtained at the Naval Observatory, and it was not until after the laying of the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that his determination was found to be near the truth.
Father Curley was also much interested in botany. He is best remembered, however, as a teacher. He wrote Annals of the Observatory of Georgetown College, D.C., containing the description of the observatory and the description and use of the transit instrument and meridian circle (New York, 1852).

[[Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus]]
CATEGORIES: Cerebrum

The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) is a small cluster of neurons situated in the anterior hypothalamus, to the side of the optic chiasm in the mammalian brain. The VLPO is active during sleep, primarily during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep), and releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, mainly GABA and galanin, which inhibit neurons that are involved in wakefulness and arousal. The VLPO is in turn innervated by neurons from brain regions involved in the arousal system. The VLPO is activated by the sleep-inducing neurotransmitters serotonin and adenosine. and endosomnogens; Prostaglandin D2 The VLPO is inhibited during wakefulness by the arousal-inducing neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The role of the VLPO in sleep and wakefulness, and its association with sleep disorders - particularly insomnia and narcolepsy - is a growing area of neuroscience research.

An EMD GP60 is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between 1985 and 1994. The GP60 was EMD's first engine that was classified as a "third-generation" locomotive.  Hidden behind the electrical cabinet doors on the rear wall of the cab, the GP60 concealed a trio of microprocessors that monitored and managed a host of engine, cooling system and control functions. The engine's on-board microprocessors replaced hundreds of wiring circuits, dozens of relays and all but one module card, making it an improvement among EMD's engines.
Power was provided by a 16-cylinder 710G3A diesel engine, which could produce [tpl]convert|3800|hp[/tpl]. This locomotive was 59 feet 9 inches long and featured a [tpl]convert|3700|USgal|L|adj=on[/tpl] fuel tank. The GP60 series shared the same frame as the GP59.  Cabless units of this locomotive model were also built; they were known as GP60B models, purchased exclusively by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Units built with a comfort/safety cab and a wide nose were designated GP60M and all purchased by the Santa Fe. A total of 294 GP60, 23 GP60B and 63 GP60M units were built by EMD.  Due to the mainstream focus of railroads on powerful six-axle units, the GP60 will most likely be the last new EMD "Geep".

CATEGORIES: Presidency of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, 1801 establishments in the United States, 19th-century disestablishments in the United States, Presidencies of the United States

Thomas Jefferson's Presidency of the United States, from March 4, 1801 to March 4, 1809, carried out what Jefferson called the "Revolution of 1800", as he attempted to put into action the principles of his Democratic-Republican Party. In domestic affairs Jefferson tried to weaken Federalist influences, especially in the judiciary, and succeeded in limiting the size of government by reducing taxes and the national debt.
In foreign affairs, the major developments were the acquisition of the gigantic Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803, an embargo against trade with both Great Britain and France, and worsening relations with Britain as the United States tried to remain neutral in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars that engulfed Europe. The war's effects reached throughout the Atlantic. While remaining "neutral," from early 1802 Jefferson allowed contraband goods and arms to reach Saint-Domingue during its slave rebellion and refused financial credit to France, aiding the slave and mulatto resistance that achieved independence in 1804. After that, however, with France removed and Congressional resistance high, he refused to recognize Haiti, and embargoed trade with it, causing severe difficulties for the second republic to rise in the Western Hemisphere.

[[P. V. Rajan & Company]]

CATEGORIES: Tobacco in India, Companies based in Tamil Nadu

P. V. Rajan & Co was a South-India based company which manufactured tobacco snuff. 
Originally started in Old Town in Chennai (formerly known as Madras), India, by Mr. Narayana Iyer and Mr. Naidu. During the evacuation of the city during World War II, the entire establishment was moved from Chennai to the southern railway town of Arakkonam. After the war, the company was handed down from its original founders to their sons. Mr. K.N.Viswanathan Iyer and Mr. K.N.Parasuraman Iyer (sons of Mr.Narayana Iyer) each had 25% share while Mr.Devaraja Naidu (son of Mr.Naidu) held 50% share of the company. Mr.K.N.Viswanathan Iyer was a brilliant strategist who turned around the company immediately after the war and substantially increased the market share of the company, thereby boosting sales and distribution network for nationwide coverage. He was very well regarded in the business circles of early south India and forged relationships with other business families in the south.
Much of the development of Arakkonam (besides it being one of the early railway junctions of the British) came about due to P.V.Rajan & Company. The snuff was manufactured in Aathoor, a small town 15 miles from Arakkonam. The company's snuff distribution network was one of the largest in South India and it employed hundreds of locals for packaging, branding, marketing and distribution of snuff throughout India. The snuff even made its way into the markets of Singapore, Malaysia and Burma owing to its popularity and superior quality.
Towards the seventies and eighties, the decline in the popularity of snuff (and other legislations against tobacco) led to the slowdown of revenue for the company, which later caused the shutdown of the company in the late nineties nearly 75 years after its inception.

It leads from Hyde Park Corner to the Serpentine Road. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Rotten Row was a fashionable place for upper-class Londoners to be seen.[ref]
</ref> Today it is maintained as a place to ride horses in the centre of London, but it is little used.
Rotten Row was established by William III at the end of the 17th century. Having moved court to Kensington Palace, William wanted a safer way to travel to the previous St. James's Palace. He created the broad avenue through Hyde Park, lit with 300 oil lamps in 1690– the first artificially lit highway in Britain. The lighting was a precaution against highwaymen, who were comparatively common in Hyde Park at the time.[tpl]cite book | title=The London Encyclopaedia | publisher=Pan Macmillan |author1=Hibbert, Cristopher |author2=Weinreb, Ben |author3=Keay, John |author4=Keay, Julia | year=2011 | pages=424| isbn=0230738788[/tpl]  The track was called Route du Roi, French for King's Road, which was eventually corrupted into "Rotten Row".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde_park/history.cfm | title = Hyde Park: History and Architecture | publisher = The Royal Parks | date = 2003-12-15 | accessdate = 2009-01-14[/tpl] 
In the 18th century, Rotten Row became a popular meeting place for upper-class Londoners. Particularly on weekend evenings and at midday, people would dress in their finest clothes in order to ride along the row and be seen. The adjacent South Carriage Drive was used by society people in carriages for the same purpose. In 1876, it was reconstructed as a horse-ride, with a brick base covered by sand.
The sand-covered avenue of Rotten Row is still maintained as a bridleway and forms part of Hyde Park's South Ride. It is particularly convenient for the Household Cavalry, stabled nearby at Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, who exercise their horses there. Members of the public also ride there, although few people have stables close enough to make use of it. However, there are commercial stables nearby, Hyde Park Stables and 'Ross Nye Stables, that offer horse hire and riding lessons to the public.
Michael Crichton's 1979 feature film, The First Great Train Robbery, is set in 1855, and includes a scene in which the character Edward Pierce (portrayed by Sean Connery) escorts Emily Trent (Pamela Salem) on a supposedly romantic ride along Rotten Row.The First Great Train Robbery. Dir. Michael Crichton. United Artists, 1979.
A Royal plaque commemorating 300 years of Rotten Row was erected in 1990.

Bernard Belleau, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC[/tpl] (March 15, 1925 – September 4, 1989) was a Canadian molecular pharmacologist best known for his role in the discovery of Lamivudine, a drug used in the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis B infection. 
Born in Montreal, Quebec, he gained his B.Sc. (1947) and M.Sc. (1948) from the Université de Montréal and his PhD in 1950 at McGill University. During his time at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research he discovered the Fujimoto-Belleau reaction, which is named after him and George I. Fujimoto.[ref]
</ref> After various academic research postings in the U.S. and Canada he became Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1961. He moved to McGill University in 1971.  Belleau worked in the 1960s and 1970s on research programs with Bristol Laboratories, one of which led to the non-narcotic analgesic Butorphanol. Butorphanol was found to have over five times the potency of morphine with far fewer side effects. Butorphanol is often used to relieve post-surgical pain and in the management of migraine headaches.  
In the mid-1980s he helped found what became the biotech company BioChem Pharma with colleagues Francesco Bellini and Gervais Dionne. The trio began work on the anti-AIDS drug, 2,3 dideoxy – 3-thiacytidine (3TC).  Just prior to his death in 1989 he laid the foundations for Lamivudine's development, which was a significant advance in the fight against AIDS, and is credited with saving over 2 million lives.http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142:belleau-aids&catid=60:belleau-aids&Itemid=141  
In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1978, he was awarded the Quebec government's Prix Marie-Victorin. In 1979, he was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's McLaughlin Medal. In 2000, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame  In 1977/78 he was awarded a Killam fellowship from The Canada Council for the Arts.

Tyler (or Tiler) is the name of the office of outer guard of a Masonic Lodge. Early speculative Masonic lodges met in rooms in taverns and other public meeting places, and all Lodges appoint a Tyler to guard the door from unqualified, malicious or simply curious people. He is also responsible for ensuring that candidates for ceremonies in the lodge have been properly prepared. Although an Officer of the Lodge and often a highly experienced Past Master, he may be considered akin to a sergeant: In some cases the Tyler may not even be a member of the lodge, but a mason from another lodge employed for the purpose.  Other duties often involve preparing the room for meetings, supplying regalia, and acting as permanent caretaker of the furniture and premises.

B minor is a minor scale consisting of the pitches B, C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], D, E, F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], G, and A. Its key signature consists of two sharps. The harmonic minor raises the note A to A[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]. Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written with accidentals as necessary.
Its relative major is D major, and its parallel major is B major.
Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (1739–1791) regarded B minor as a key expressing a quiet acceptance of fate and very gentle complaint, something commentators find to be in line with Bach's use of the key in the St John Passion.Tusa, pp. 2–3, n. 5 By Beethoven's time, however, the perception of B minor had changed considerably: Francesco Galeazzi wrote that B minor was not suitable for music in good taste, and Beethoven labelled a B minor melodic idea in one of his sketchbooks as a "black key".Tusa, p. 2, n. 3

The Daily Telegraph (retrieved February 28, 2011) has been described as the “most important private museum of sculpture in the world” by Italian art critic Federico Zeri and, according to The Daily Telegraph, has been “said to rival ancient sculptures of the Vatican.” The Encyclopædia Britannica considers the most significant of the works a relief of Heracles freeing Theseus and Peirithoos (4th century BC, attributed to the school of Phidias) and a sculpture of “Hestia Giustiniani” (5th century BC, attributed to Kalamis)."Torlonia Museum." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. (retrieved 28 February 2011) Overall, the collection contains 20 statues of Hercules, about 30 of Venus, and 100 of the Caesars and their families,Bruce Johnston (2 September, 2004). Roman statues back on show. The Daily Telegraph (retrieved 28 February 2011) among them a bust of Julius Caesar. Besides, it includes sculptures of the gods from Roman mythology and Roman copies of Greek statues.
According to the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the namesake of the collection and then the museum, the Roman Torlonia family, received ownership of the collection around 1800 or in the early 19th century. The previous owners, the Giustiniani family, had taken out a loan from the Torlonia dynasty and secured it with the collection, but then defaulted on paying back the loan. (According to earlier information by the same newspaper, however, Prince Giovanni Torlonia himself was the founder of the collection when, in 1810, “he bought some works and unearthed others on his land in Portus”.)
Alessandro Torlonia, heir to Giovanni, opened the collection to visitors in their family palace on Via della Lungara, close to the Tiber River, in 1893. In the 1960s, the museum was dismantled and the 77-room palace was converted into a 93-unit apartment building. The collection was put into storage and has not been publicly displayed. In May 2005 the family that owned the collection agreed to sell the collection to the city of Rome for £1.2 billion.

[[YEPD]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiological media

YEPD or yeast extract peptone dextrose, also often abbreviated as YPD, is a complete medium for yeast growth.  It contains yeast extract, peptone, double-distilled water, and glucose or dextrose. It can be used as solid medium by including agar.  The yeast extract will typically contain all the amino acids necessary for growth.  By being a complete medium, YEPD cannot be used as a selection medium to test for auxotrophs.  Instead, YEPD is used as a growth medium to grow yeast cultures.  
The agar version of YEPD typically consists of .3% (mass/volume) yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% glucose/dextrose, 2% agar, with the rest being bidest water.  
The broth version of YEPD typically contains 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose/dextrose, and the rest is distilled water.

The Light in the Piazza is a musical with a book by Craig Lucas and music and lyrics by Adam Guettel.  Based on a novella by Elizabeth Spencer, the story is set in the 1950s and revolves around Margaret Johnson, a wealthy Southern woman and her emotionally stalled daughter, Clara, who spend a summer together in Italy. When Clara falls in love with a young Italian man, Margaret is forced to reconsider not only Clara's future, but her own deep seated hopes and regrets as well.
The score breaks from the 21st century tradition of pop music on Broadway by moving into the territory of Neoromantic classical music and opera, with unexpected harmonic shifts and extended melodic structures, and is more heavily orchestrated than most Broadway scores. It is also perhaps the only bilingual Broadway musical. Many of the lyrics are in Italian or broken English, as many of the characters are fluent only in Italian.

Bolt is a 2008 American computer-animated adventure/action comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the studio's 48th animated feature. It is the first film directed by Chris Williams (who previously worked on Mulan and The Emperor's New Groove) and Byron Howard (who previously worked on Lilo & Stitch and Brother Bear). The film stars the voices of John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Malcolm McDowell, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson, Greg Germann, Susie Essman and Mark Walton. The film's plot centers on a small white dog named Bolt who, having spent his entire life on the set of a television series, thinks that he has super powers. When he believes that his human, Penny, has been kidnapped, he sets out on a cross-country journey to "rescue" her.
As with earlier CGI Disney films, such as Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons, Bolt was also distributed in Disney Digital 3-D in the theaters equipped for it. The film was nominated for a series of awards, such as the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, however, lost to WALL-E.

[[Bitmap index]]

CATEGORIES: Bit data structures, Data management, Database index techniques

A bitmap index is a special kind of database index that uses bitmaps.
Bitmap indexes have traditionally been considered to work well for low-cardinality columns, which have a modest number of distinct values, either absolutely, or relative to the number of records that contain the data. The extreme case of low cardinality is Boolean data (e.g.,Does a resident in a city have internet access?), which has two values, True and False. Bitmap indexes use bit arrays (commonly called bitmaps) and answer queries by performing bitwise logical operations on these bitmaps. Bitmap indexes have a significant space and performance advantage over other structures for query of such data. Their drawback is they are less efficient than the traditional B-tree indexes for columns whose data is frequently updated: consequently, they are more often employed in read-only systems that are specialized for fast query - e.g., data warehouses, and generally unsuitable for online transaction processing applications. However, this drawback appears to apply only to their implementation in relational database management systems: certain non-relational DBMSs, notably Intersystems Cache, a hierarchical database, use bitmap indexes for low-cardinality columns in transactional systems.
Some researchers argue that Bitmap indexes are also useful for moderate or even high-cardinality data (e.g., unique-valued data) which is accessed in a read-only manner, and queries access multiple bitmap-indexed columns using the AND, OR or XOR operators extensively.Bitmap Index vs. B-tree Index: Which and When?, Vivek Sharma, Oracle Technical Network.
Bitmap indexes are also useful in data warehousing applications for joining a large fact table to smaller dimension tables such as those arranged in a star schema.

[[Giuseppe Schirò]]

CATEGORIES: Italian people of Arbëresh descent, 1865 births, 1925 deaths, People from Piana degli Albanesi

Giuseppe Schirò (Arbërisht: Zef Skiroi; Piana degli Albanesi, August 10, 1865 – Napoli, February 17, 1927)Albanian literature: a short history, by Robert Elsie, Centre for Albanian Studies (London, England), pp. 61-64 was an Arbëreshë neo-classical poet, linguist, publicist and folklorist from Sicily. His literary work marked the transition to modern Albanian literature in Italy.
After attending the Italo-Albanian Seminar of Palermo, he graduated in law. In the first period of its activity the Schirò treated the patriotic tradition of Albanian literature, deepened the knowledge of tradition and patriotic folklorist. Soon he devoted himself exclusively to literary studies, creating the classics of Albanian literature. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, has established the literary activity of Zef Schirò.
He has composed a lyric polished and elegant, author of the poem "Mili e Hajdhia" (1891), in a pure language and emblematic for the fusion of multiple elements in a koine Albanians dialect. In addition to the idyllic poem "Mili e Hajdhia", of popular inspiration, and the "Rapsodie Arbëreshe" (Albanians Rapsody), with refined Albanians poems, wrote the fictionalized story in verse "Te Dheu i Huaj" (In a Foreign Country) and the poem "Mino", dedicated to his son, brutally killed by extremist politicians.
Among other major works include: "Kënga Liktori" (Songs of Liktor), "Këthimi" (The Return), "Këngë Tradicionale të Kolonivet Arbëreshe në Siçili" (Traditional Songs of the Albanian Colonies of Sicily), "Këngë popullore e Shqipërisë" (Folk songs of Albania). The collection of poems "Kënkat e luftës" (The songs of the battle) of 1907, inspired by the ideal of Albanian independence, the poet poses one of the most vibrant singers of "Rilindja Shqiptare" (Albanian Resurgence). On the same theme dedicated to the publication "Fiamuri i Arbërit" (The Albanian flag) and the book "The Albanians and the Balkan question", both in 1904.
He was among the most important representatives of Albanian literature of the nineteenth century, one of the finest masters of style of Albanian literature, and author of numerous works that have received considerable acclaim from critics and the public, especially the following works: "Rapsodie Arbëreshe" (1887), "Milo e Haidhe" (1889-1907), "Te Dheu i Huaj" (1900-1920), "Këthimi" (1925).
No less significant were the surveys conducted in the field of literary traditions popular: "Këngë Tradicionale të Kolonivet Arbëreshe në Siçili" (Sacred songs of the Colonies Albanians in Sicily, 1890-1907) and the monumental work entitled "Këngë Tradicionale dhe Sprova të tjera të Kolonivet Arbëreshe të Siçilisë" (Traditional Songs and Other Essays of the Colonies Albanians in Sicily, 1927). Zef Schirò had a strong friendship with prominent cultural personalities of Albanian and Italian.
Unlike other poets Albanians, Giuseppe Schirò does not close in the parlance of their own country or region, he draws from all the Albanian spoken, with a view to unify them. Was the first professor of Albanian Language and Literature at Naples, he taught from 1900 until his death. As an intellectual and professor spoke in the Italian cultural and political circles the idea of the Albanian Nation and became a promoter of publishing initiatives, such as magazines "Arbri i rii" and "Flamuri i Shqiperisë",
The poet knew the local boss Francesco Cuccia mayor of Piana degli Albanesi, before "dei Greci", in April 1922, for this reason he was accused of having supported and then to be against the Nicola Barbato, the socialist leader of the town.  Schirò has never officially supported nor the fascist movement nor the socialist movement. The wife of a socialist Italo-Albanian killed, after his death, says that he publicly defended the Mafia administration of Cuccia several times, considering it "the most suitable for the peaceful development of the best qualities of its people," able to open "a new period in our history." In a speech from the balcony of City Hall, he praised Cuccia to have had the merit and the courage "to have done away with that red flag of socialism from our community."[tpl]it icon[/tpl] Il coraggio di Mariano Barbato, La Sicilia, January 17, 2010

The Recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filter is an algorithm which recursively finds the filter coefficients that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the input signals. This is in contrast to other algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) that aim to reduce the mean square error. In the derivation of the RLS, the input signals are considered deterministic, while for the LMS and similar algorithm they are considered stochastic. Compared to most of its competitors, the RLS exhibits extremely fast convergence. However, this benefit comes at the cost of high computational complexity.

Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts (Serbian: Црногорска академија наука и умјетности; Crnogorska akademija nauka i umjetnosti or CANU) is the most important scientific institution of Montenegro.
It was founded in 1973 as the Montenegrin Society for Science and Arts (Crnogorsko društvo za nauku i umjetnost) and adopted its current name in 1976. It currently has 40 members (academicians) in three departments: natural sciences, humanities and arts.
The CANU is often considered and described as a pro-Serbian institution in Montenegro, as the academy' posits the Serb ethnic origin of the Montenegrins. In opposition to this, a splinter group of intellectuals had formed the Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts (DANU) in 1997, registered as a non-governmental organization, in an attempt to counter the official pro-Serbian academy.  
Amid the constitutional reforms of 2007 CANU had resisted the standardization of the Montenegrin language supporting the interpretation according to which Montenegrin is a dialect of the Serbian language.http://www.pobjeda.co.me/citanje.php?datum=2007-06-01&id=119208 Some of CANU's prominent members have actively participated in the campaign against Montenegro's independence in the 2006 independence referendum. CANU president Momir Đurović had in 2007 maintained contacts with members of the pro-Serbian political opposition, and had visited the headquarters of the Serb People's Party and its leader Andrija Mandić during the negotiations on language-naming in the new constitution. The Academy has also criticized Montenegrin government's decision to recognize Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. 
CANU is also a member of the Board for Standardization of the Serbian Language and does not participate in the efforts aimed at standardizing the Montenegrin language.http://www.rastko.org.rs/filologija/odbor/index_c.html

The parade incorporates elaborate, brightly lit floats, a musical score, and many sound effects. The floats are populated with Disney characters and represent scenes from Disney's animated features and short films. As of July 1, 2013 Disney officials have confirmed that the float units for Spectromagic have been destroyed and the parade has been permanently retired.http://forums.wdwmagic.com/threads/6-25-13-the-day-spectro-died-sorry-guys.867906/ Retrieved 02/07/2013 http://www.insidethemagic.net/2013/07/spectromagic-parade-officially-and-permanently-retires-as-walt-disney-world-looks-ahead-to-festival-of-fantasy/ Retrieved 02/07/2013Some small elements from the parade have been retained for possible future use.

[[Freeman (Colonial)]]
CATEGORIES: Slavery in the United States, History of labor relations in the United States

Freeman is a term which originated in 12th-century Europe and was common as an English or American Colonial expression in Puritan times. In the Bay Colony, a man had to be a member of the Church to be a freeman.  In Colonial Plymouth, a man did not need to be a member of the Church, but he had to be elected to this privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the right to vote, and by 1632 only freemen could vote in Plymouth.[tpl]cite book|last=Stratton|first=Eugene Aubrey|title=Plymouth Colony:  Its History and People 1620 - 1691|year=1986|publisher=Ancestry Publishing|location=Salt Lake City, UT|isbn=0-916489-18-3|pages=146–147[/tpl] 
Black's Law Dictionary (9th edition) defines Freeman as follows:
1. A person who possesses and enjoys all the civil and political rights belonging to the people under a free government. 
2. A person who is not a slave. 
3. Hist. A member of a municipal corporation (a city or a borough) who possesses full civic rights, esp. the right to vote. 
4. Hist. A freeholder. Cf. VILLEIN. 5. Hist. An allodial landowner. Cf. VASSAL. - also written free man.[tpl]cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A., Editor in Chief|authorlink=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=9th |year=2009|publisher=West Publishing|location=St. Paul, MN USA|isbn=978-0-314-19949-2|pages=736–737[/tpl] 
"Freedom" was earned after an allotted time, or until the person demanding "payment" was satisfied – this was known as indentured servitude, and was not originally intended as a stigma or embarrassment for the person involved since many of the sons and daughters of the wealthy and famous of the time found themselves forced into such temporary servitude. 
An indentured servant would sign a contract agreeing to serve for a specific number of years, typically five or seven.  Many immigrants to the colonies came as indentured servants, with someone else paying their passage to the Colonies in return for a promise of service. At the end of his service, according to the contract, the indentured servant (male or female) usually would be granted a sum of money, a new suit of clothes, land, or perhaps passage back to England. An indentured servant was not the same as an apprentice or a child who was "placed out."
Once a man was made a freeman, and was no longer considered a common, he could, and usually would, become a member of the church, and he could own land.  The amount of land he was able to own was sometimes determined by how many members there were in his family. As a freeman, he became a member of the governing body, which met in annual or semiannual meetings (town meetings) to make and enforce laws and pass judgment in civil and criminal matters. As the colonies grew these meetings became impractical and a representative bicameral system was developed.  Freeman would choose deputy governors who made up the upper house of the General Court and assistant governors, the lower house, who chose the governor from among their ranks, and who passed judgments in civil and criminal matters.  To hold one of these offices it was required, of course, for one to be a freeman.  Thus, the enfranchised voters and office holders were landholding male church members.  Women, Native Americans and other non-Puritans were not made freeman.

McBride currently resides in the heavily Irish neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston and trains in nearby Brockton, Massachusetts.
McBride's career-defining performance was a victory over Mike Tyson, former undisputed world heavyweight champion, via a 6th-round TKO on June 11, 2005 When Tyson quit the fight by informing the referee that he would not be able to continue to round Seven in the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.McBride's career britishboxing.net - Retrieved: 14 July 2007 The aged Tyson explained in a post fight interview that his heart wasn't into the sport anymore.http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2083271 espn.com - Retrieved: 11 May 2009 Tyson announced his retirement after the bout, saying "I'm not going to disrespect the sport anymore by losing to this caliber of fighter".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-352034/Tyson-wont-disrespect-boxing-fighting-on.html |title=Tyson won't 'disrespect' boxing by fighting on | Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2010-09-17[/tpl]

The anis are the three species of near-passerine birds in the genus Crotophaga of the cuckoo family. They are essentially tropical New world birds, although the range of two species just reaches the United States. Recent DNA evidence places them in a new family, Crotophagidae.[tpl]cite journal |author=Avise JC, Nelson WS, Sibley CG |title=Why one-kilobase sequences from mitochondrial DNA fail to solve the Hoatzin phylogenetic enigma |journal=Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=175–84 |date=June 1994 |pmid=8075835 |doi=10.1006/mpev.1994.1019 [/tpl]
Unlike some cuckoos, the anis are not brood parasites, but nest communally, the cup nest being built by several pairs between 2–6 m high in a tree. A number of females lay their eggs in the nest and then share incubation and feeding. 
The anis are large black birds with a long tail and a deep ridged black bill. Their flight is weak and wobbly, but they run well, and usually feed on the ground.
These are very gregarious species, always found in noisy groups. Anis feed on termites,  large insects and even lizards and frogs. The claim that they will remove ticks and other parasites from grazing animals has been disputed; while there is no doubt that anis follow grazing animals in order to catch disturbed insects and will occasionally eat fallen ticks, there is no proof that they actively remove ticks from the animals' bodies.

[[Shout (Devo album)]]
CATEGORIES: Devo albums, 1984 albums, Infinite Zero albums, Warner Bros. Records albums, Virgin Records albums

Shout is a 1984 album by the New Wave rock band Devo. It was their sixth album for Warner Bros. Records and retained the synth-pop sound of their previous records with a heavy focus on the then new Fairlight CMI computer synthesizer. Despite the popularity of synth-pop in 1984, the album was a critical and commercial failure and ultimately led to Warner Bros. Records dropping the band; they would not release another album through the label until Something for Everybody in 2010. Following its release, the band went on hiatus for four years.
One of Shout's best-known tracks is "Are You Experienced?", a Jimi Hendrix cover that carried on the Devo tradition of 'mutating' famous songs which began with their 1978 cover of the Rolling Stones classic "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". Ironically, the cover was marginally more accessible than the heavily experimental Hendrix track. Additionally, the chorus melody of Hendrix's "Third Stone from the Sun" is transformed into a guitar solo partway through the track. The track "The 4th Dimension" also incorporates the guitar hook from The Beatles' song "Day Tripper", "Jurisdiction of Love" has a few notes from "Love Machine" by The Miracles, and "Here to Go" quotes a bit of the Wilson Pickett hit "Land of a Thousand Dances."
The album was the only one to use the Fairlight CMI computer to create songs. This approach further pushed the sound of the guitar into the background of their music. According to a 2005 interview with Bob Mothersbaugh, "Mark and Jerry kept saying in interviews that the guitar was obsolete and wanted to prove it with the Shout album."  Interview with Bob Mothersbaugh (2005) - Booji Boy's Basement  Drummer Alan Myers left the band shortly after the album's release, citing feeling creatively deprived, partially from the band's use of drum machines and the Fairlight.

Canada Place is a building situated on the Burrard Inlet waterfront of Vancouver, British Columbia. It is the home of the Vancouver Convention Centre, the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel, Vancouver's World Trade Centre, and FlyOver Canada (a virtual flight ride which replaced the world's first permanent IMAX 3D theatre and which ceased operation on October 1, 2009). The building's exterior is covered by fabric roofs resembling sails.[tpl]cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005[/tpl] It is also the main cruise ship terminal for the region, where most of Vancouver's famous cruises to Alaska originate. The building was designed by architects Zeidler Roberts Partnership in joint venture with Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership and DA Architects + Planners.
Canada Place can be reached via the SkyTrain line at the nearby Waterfront Station terminus or via West Cordova Street in Vancouver. The white sails of the building have made it a prominent landmark for the city, as well as drawing comparisons to the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and the Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado.
The structure was expanded in 2001 to accommodate another cruise ship berth and in 2009/10, for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada Place served as the Main Press Centre.

[[Common Indexing Protocol]]

CATEGORIES: Internet protocols, Identity management

The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) was an attempt in the IETF working group FIND during the mid-1990s to define a protocol for exchanging index information between directory services.  
In the X.500 Directory model, searches scoped near the root of the tree (e.g. at a particular country) were 
problematic to implement, as potentially hundreds or thousands of directory servers would need to be contacted
in order to handle that query.  
The indexes contained summaries or subsets of information about individuals and organizations represented in
a white pages schema.  By merging subsets of information from multiple sources, it was hoped that an index 
server holding that subset could be able to process a query more efficiently by chaining it only to some 
of the sources: those sources which did not hold information would not be contacted.  For example, if a server 
holding the base entry for a particular country were provided with a list of names of all the people in all the 
entries in that country subtree, then that server would be able to process a query searching for a person with
a particular name by only chaining it to those servers which held data about such a person. 
The protocol evolved from earlier work developing WHOIS++, and was intended to be capable of interconnecting
services from both the evolving WHOIS and LDAP activities. 
This protocol has not seen much recent deployment, as WHOIS and LDAP environments 
have followed separate evolution paths.  WHOIS deployments are typically in domain name registrars, and its 
data management issues have been addressed through specifications for domain name registry interconnection such as 
CRISP.  In contrast, enterprises that manage employee, customer
or student identity data in an LDAP directory have looked to federation protocols for interconnection between 
organizations.

Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) was an American psychologist who taught for over 30 years at Harvard University. He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930 and collaborated with Stanley Cobb, Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna.  He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.  While personality theory in psychology was becoming dominated by the statistics of trait theory, Murray developed a theory of personality called Personology, based on "need" and "press". Patterned after chemistry's Henderson–Hasselbach equation for the pH of a solution, Personology was a holistic approach that studied the person at many levels of complexity all at the same time by an interdisciplinary team of investigators. Murray was also a co-developer, with Christiana Morgan, of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which he referred to as "the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music."

[[Set packing]]

CATEGORIES: Combinatorics, NP-complete problems

Set packing is a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory and combinatorics, and was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.
Suppose we have a finite set S and a list of subsets of S. Then, the set packing problem asks if some k subsets in the list are pairwise disjoint (in other words, no two of them share an element).
The problem is clearly in NP since, given k subsets, we can easily verify that they are pairwise disjoint in polynomial time.
The optimization version of the problem, maximum set packing, asks for the maximum number of pairwise disjoint sets in the list. It is a maximization problem that can be formulated naturally as an integer linear program, belongs to the class of packing problems, and its dual linear program is the set cover problem.[tpl]harvtxt|Vazirani|2001[/tpl]

William Brockwell (21 January 1865 – 1 July 1935) was an English cricketer. Although primarily remembered as a batsman, he began his career as a fast-medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, he was a very useful bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire.
Born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Brockwell played his county cricket for the very strong Surrey side of the last years of the 19th century. He made his first-class debut against Derbyshire in 1886. He played only occasionally up to 1890, but established himself in 1891 and 1892, when Surrey were at the height of their powers as a county side. However, it was not until 1893 that Brockwell became a vital member of the Surrey eleven, when he took 51 wickets at the same cost as the incomparable Richardson and, despite often going in late, proving to be one of the most consistent batsmen. In the very wet 1894 season, Brockwell, despite the consistently treacherous pitches, made a remarkable advance. He scored more runs (1,491) than any other player, and hit five centuries, and consequently was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He declined a great deal in 1895, but from the following year up to 1899, formed a formidable batting trio with Bobby Abel and Tom Hayward that made Surrey invincible on the perfect Oval pitches.
Brockwell played seven Test matches for England, all against Australia - one in 1893, five on the 1894/95 tour and a final match in 1899 - but was not a success at this level and averaged under 17 with a highest score of just 49. He played on for Surrey until 1903, but from 1900 his powers as a batsman declined severely and after two final first-class matches for London County he retired from cricket.
Brockwell's retirement was not a happy one, and he died in poverty at Richmond, Surrey.

[[Topographic profile]]

CATEGORIES: Topography

A topographic profile is a cross sectional view along a line drawn through a portion of a topographic map.  In other words, if you could slice through a portion of the earth, pull away one half, and  look at it from the side, the surface would be a topographic profile.
Not only does constructing a topographic profile aid in understanding topographic maps, it is very useful for geologists when analyzing numerous problems.

[[Aseptic meningitis]]

CATEGORIES: Meningitis, Enterovirus-associated diseases

Aseptic meningitis, or sterile meningitis, is a condition in which the layers lining the brain, meninges, become inflamed and a pyogenic bacterial source is not to blame.  Meningitis is diagnosed on a history of characteristic symptoms and certain examination findings (e.g., Kernig's sign).  Investigations should show an increase in the number of leukocytes present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), obtained via lumbar puncture, (normal being fewer than five visible per microscopic High Power Field).
The term aseptic is frequently a misnomer, implying a lack of infection.  On the contrary, many cases of aseptic meningitis represent infection with viruses[tpl]DorlandsDict|five/000064654|aseptic meningitis[/tpl] or mycobacteria that cannot be detected with routine methods.  While the advent of polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, many viruses can still escape detection.  Additionally, mycobacteria frequently require special stains and culture methods that make their detection difficult.  When CSF findings are consistent with meningitis, and microbiologic testing is unrevealing, clinicians typically assign the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis—making it a relative diagnosis of exclusion.
Aseptic meningitis can result from non-infectious causes; it is a relatively infrequent side effect of medications, and can be an early finding in autoimmune disease.
There is no formal classification system.  It is usually by the causative organism if identified.
"Aseptic meningitis", like non-gonococcal urethritis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and atypical pneumonia, merely states what a condition is not, not what a condition is. Terms such as viral meningitis, bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis, neoplastic meningitis and drug-induced aseptic meningitis can provide more information about the condition, and without using one of these more specific terms, it is difficult to describe treatment options or prognosis.

[[Diagnosis of exclusion]]
CATEGORIES: Medical terminology

A diagnosis of exclusion (per exclusionem) is a diagnosis of a medical condition reached by a process of elimination, which may be necessary if presence cannot be established with complete confidence from examination or testing. Such elimination of other reasonable possibilities is a major component in performing a differential diagnosis.
Perhaps the largest category of diagnosis by exclusion is seen among psychiatric disorders where the presence of physical or organic disease must be excluded as a pre-requisite for making a functional diagnosis. Diagnosis by exclusion tends to occur where scientific knowledge is scarce, specifically where the means to verify a diagnosis by an objective method is absent. As a specific diagnosis cannot be confirmed a fall back position is to exclude that group of known causes that may cause a similar clinical presentation.

Comparative negligence, or non-absolute contributory negligence outside of the United States,  is a partial legal defense that reduces the amount of damages that a plaintiff can recover in a negligence-based claim based upon the degree to which the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to cause the injury. When the defense is asserted, the fact-finder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the plaintiff's negligence versus the combined negligence of all other relevant actors contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages.  It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence which disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed, even minimally, to causing the damages.

[[Melbourne Racing Club]]

The Melbourne Racing Club is one of three metropolitan horse racing clubs in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It began life as the Victoria Amateur Turf Club in 1875 with Mr. E.C. Moore as the Club's first Secretary. The Dowling Forest Racecourse in  Ballarat was the location for the first VATC race meeting on Friday, 24 March 1876.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5412955 |title=SPORTING NEWS. |newspaper=The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889-1931) |location=Adelaide, SA |date=11 June 1913 |accessdate=4 July 2011 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl] Within six months the VATC were granted use of Crown land at Caulfield as a permanent home in Melbourne.
In 1879, the club staged the first running of the Caulfield Cup, and two years later, introduced the Caulfield Guineas and the Toorak Handicap. In addition the Caulfield Cup was switched to the spring racing season and became the lead up race to the Melbourne Cup. The Futurity Stakes was added to the racing calendar in 1898. The Club suffered the loss of the Members' Stand in 1922 when it was destroyed by fire, and five years later the Guineas Stand was also burnt down.
The military occupied Caulfield Racecourse in 1940 for a period of four years when it became a depot and barracks for army recruits during the second World War. The then Vice-President of the USA, Richard Nixon attended the Caulfield Cup meeting in 1953.
In 1963 the Melbourne Racing Club, which had been created from an amalgamation of the Williamstown Racing Club and the Victorian Racing and Trotting Association, was incorporated into the VATC. Following the merger, the newest of Melbourne’s race tracks, Sandown Racecourse, was opened on 19 June 1965 in front of a crowd of over 52,000.
The first Blue Diamond Stakes, a race for 2 year olds, was run at Caulfield in 1971 and won by Tolerance. 
The glass-fronted Rupert Clarke Grandstand, which replaced the main Caulfield grandstand of the 1920s, was opened in 1992.
With the increase in the number of visiting international horses to the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival a permanent Quarantine Centre was established by the VATC at Sandown Racecourse in 1997.
In 2001 the Club commenced a five year, $20 million, strategic plan which included the establishment of 20 feature race days at Caulfield; construction of a second turf track at Sandown to be known as Hillside, with the existing circuit being renamed Lakeside; a major upgrade of facilities and training tracks at Caulfield; and the change of club name from Victoria Amateur Turf Club to Melbourne Racing Club.
Jumps racing is conducted at the Sandown track during the winter months, the blue ribbon events being the Australian Steeple and the Australian Hurdle.

The Rolls-Royce Corniche is a two-door, four-seater  luxury car with a cabriolet body, made in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2002. Rolls-Royce's flagship car, it was the fifth model to bear the Corniche name on its debut in January 2000. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive vehicle offered by Rolls-Royce, with a base price of US$359,900. Styling cues were taken from the Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph sedan, but it shares little mechanically with that BMW-engined car. Instead, the Corniche's body was set onto the older platform used for the similarly-styled Bentley Azure, making it the first and only Rolls-Royce descended from a Bentley rather than the other way around.

At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks, only [tpl]convert|7|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and tumbles [tpl]convert|43|m|ft[/tpl], then flows westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000 ft³/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than ten metres (30 ft) wide.
Sir Samuel Baker  named them after Sir Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society.Encyclopædia Britannica online   The falls lend their name to the surrounding Murchison Falls National Park.
During the regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s the name was changed to Kabarega Falls, after the Omukama (King) Kabarega of Bunyoro, although this was never legally promulgated. The name reverted to Murchison Falls following the downfall of Idi Amin United Nations Environment Programme It is still sometimes referred to as Kabarega Falls.

[[Agüimes, Las Palmas]]
CATEGORIES: Municipalities in Gran Canaria

Agüimes is a municipality in the eastern part of the island of Gran Canaria in the Las Palmas province in the Canary Islands. The population is 30,214 (2013), and the area is 79.28 km². The elevation is 275 m. Agüimes is situated 5 km from the coast, and 26 km south of the island capital Las Palmas. The GC-1 motorway passes east of the town.
The major growth of the last few years has been the creation of a huge industrial estate on flat land once covered by tomato plantations. This has brought new jobs and industries into the area and has spurred the development of a new purpose built port which is due to open in 2007.
The district was not at one time a major tourist destination, but after the careful restoration of the old town, this has become the best example of a traditional Canarian hill town. The streets of the old town exude a gentle, relaxed, timeless atmosphere, and the carefully positioned street statues and sculptures add a series of surprises to a visit to the old town. The local plan for 'rural tourism' has led to the development of other small visitor centres on the district, the biggest of which is in the Guayadeque Ravine. This area has many cave houses dating back hundreds of years, and a complete village dug into the hillside, still occupied today which has its own cave church, cave bar and cave restaurants.
Sporting activities are also very important in the area, with its windsurfing and scuba diving recognized as "world class". One round of the annual PWA windsurfing tour is held at the international windsurfing center at Pozo Izquierdo every year, and the whole of the coast in this area can provide challenging conditions at any time of the year.
The main area for scuba diving in Gran Canaria is in the area known as the 'El Cabrón' marine reserve, next to the town of Arinaga. The diving in this area includes caves, arches, walls and volcanic reefs, where an extremely wide range of sub-tropical marine species can be found, ranging from tiny seahorses up to rays and angel sharks.

Vijaysingh Madhavji Merchant [tpl]audio|Vijay_Merchant.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl], real name Vijay Madhavji Thakersey (12 October 1911 – 27 October 1987) was an Indian cricketer. A right-hand batter and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Merchant played first class cricket for Bombay cricket team as well as 10 Test matches for India between 1929 and 1951. Behind his limited Test appearances, he dominated Indian domestic cricket – his batting average of 71.64 is the second highest first class average in history, behind only that of Don Bradman. He is regarded as the founder of the Bombay School of Batsmanship, that placed more importance on right technique, steely temperament, and conservative approach rather than free flow of the bat, a tradition broken and remoulded only after the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar.
His international career included two tours of England upon which he scored over 800 runs. English cricketer CB Fry exclaimed "Let us paint him white and take him with us to Australia as an opener."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30996.html|title=Vijay Merchant|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] His brother, Uday, also played first-class cricket.

[[Conway's Soldiers]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical games

Conway's Soldiers or the checker-jumping problem is a one-person mathematical game or puzzle devised and analyzed by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1961. A variant of peg solitaire, it takes place on an infinite checkerboard. The board is divided by a horizontal line that extends indefinitely. Above the line are empty cells and below the line are an arbitrary number of game pieces, or "soldiers". As in peg solitaire, a move consists of one soldier jumping over an adjacent soldier into an empty cell, vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally), and removing the soldier which was jumped over.  The goal of the puzzle is to place a soldier as far above the horizontal line as possible.
Conway proved that, regardless of the strategy used, there is no finite series of moves that will allow a soldier to advance more than four rows above the horizontal line.  His argument uses a carefully chosen weighting of cells (involving the golden ratio), and he proved that the total weight can only decrease or remain constant.  This argument has been reproduced in a number of popular math books.
Simon Tatham and Gareth Taylor have shown that the fifth row can be reached via an infinite series of moves http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/; this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke http://www.math.unl.edu/~shartke2/.  If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can be reached but not the 9th row.  It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can be reached is 3n-2.  Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot be reached.  It is considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 can be reached (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).

CATEGORIES: Optical computer storage

Write once read many (WORM) describes a data storage device in which information, once written, cannot be modified. This write protection affords the assurance that the data cannot be tampered with once it is written to the device.
On ordinary (non-WORM) data storage devices, the number of times data can be modified is limited only by the lifespan of the device, as modification involves physical changes that may cause wear to the device. The "read many" aspect is unremarkable, as modern storage devices permit unlimited reading of data once written.Historical exceptions include time-limited discs such as Flexplay, designed for short-term rental of movies; and early non-volatile memory technologies such as magnetic-core memory  and bubble memory, from which reading data also erased it.

Its provenance is unknown, but a French collector acquired the stone from Nazareth. It is now in the collections of the Louvre.E.

Although the text contains no reference to Jesus of Nazareth or Christianity, it has been of interest chiefly to scholars who view it as evidence for the historicity of Jesus and his resurrection (as described by Matthew 28.12–13). It can also be read in the broader context of Roman law pertaining to exhumation and reburial, mentioned also by Pliny.Pliny, Epistles 10.68f.; C.

The mountain pine beetle (MPB) Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a species of bark beetle native to the forests of western North America from Mexico to central British Columbia. It has a hard black exoskeleton, and measures approximately 5 mm, about the size of a grain of rice.
In western North America, the current outbreak of the mountain pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of lodgepole pine forest, including more than 16 million hectares in British Columbia. The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of millions of acres of ponderosa and lodgepole pine trees. According to an annual assessment by the state's forest service, 264,000 acres of trees in Colorado were infested by the mountain pine beetle at the beginning of 2013. This was much smaller than the 1.15 million acres that were affected in 2008 because the beetle has already killed off most of the vulnerable trees (Ward).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-ward/colorado-pine-beetles-wildfires_b_3453706.html |title=Bob Ward: Colorado Wildfires Are Linked to Global Warming |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2014-02-14[/tpl]

Normally, these insects play an important role in the life of a forest, attacking old or weakened trees, and speeding development of a younger forest.

CATEGORIES: Intravenous fluids

Lactated Ringer's solution is a solution that is isotonic with blood and intended for intravenous administration. It may also be given subcutaneously. Lactated Ringer's solution is grouped with intravenous fluids known as "crystalloids" – which include saline and dextrose solutions (compared to the "colloids" which contain larger molecules such as starch or gelatine).
Lactated Ringer's solution is abbreviated as "LR", "RL" or "LRS". It is also known as Ringer's lactate solution (although Ringer's solution technically refers only to the saline component, without lactate). It is very similar, though not identical to, Hartmann's solution, which is more commonly found in British and Irish hospitals[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] and has slightly different ionic concentrations.

"You're The Top" is a Cole Porter song from the 1934 musical Anything Goes. It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best-selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single, which made the top five.
It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies.[tpl]cite book|last=Redmond|first=James|title=Drama, Dance and Music|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-22180-1|page=60[/tpl]
The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability.
Some of the lyrics were re-written by P. G. Wodehouse for the British version of Anything Goes.

[[Polyketone]]

CATEGORIES: Organic polymers, Thermoplastics

Polyketones are a family of high-performance thermoplastic polymers. The polar ketone groups in the polymer backbone of these materials gives rise to a strong attraction between polymer chains, which increases the material's melting point (255 °C for Copolymer (Carbonmonoxid ethylen), 220 °C for Terpolymer (Carbonmonoxid, ethylen, propylen), Tradenames:Carilon Shell, "Karilon" Hyosung, "Akrotek" Akro-Plastic). Such materials also tend to resist solvents and have good mechanical properties. Unlike many other engineering plastics, aliphatic polyketones such as Shell Chemicals' Carilon are relatively easy to synthesize and can be derived from inexpensive monomers. Carilon is made with a palladium(II) catalyst from ethylene and carbon monoxide. A small fraction of the ethylene is generally replaced with propylene to reduce the melting point somewhat.  Shell Chemical commercially launched Carilon thermoplastic polymer in the U.S.in 1996,Shell Chemical Company announces The U.S. commercial launch of CARILON Polymers but discontinued it in 2000.MatWeb-Shell Carilon® DP P1000 Polyketone  (discontinued **)  SRI International offers Carilon thermoplastic polymers.Carilon Thermoplastic Polymer - Next-Generation Plastics from SRI International

CATEGORIES: American male singers, American Christians, American performers of Christian music, Southern Gospel performers, 1938 births, 2001 deaths

Danny Gaither (November 20, 1938 - April 6, 2001), was a gospel music singer from Alexandria, Indiana and an original member of the world-famous Bill Gaither Trio.
As the founding tenor of the enormously successful trio, Danny sang to audiences around the world with his brother Bill and sister Mary Ann, who was later replaced by Bill's wife Gloria. In 1977, he left the group and embarked on a successful solo career, producing a number of albums including "Singing to the World", "It Is Well With My Soul", "Sing a Song of Love" and "Sweet and High".
The stress of touring affected Dan, and in the early 1990s he experienced problems with his vocal cords.  The problems were so severe that he was forced to stop touring, although he was able to occasionally appear with Bill and other fellow gospel singers in the well-known "Homecoming" performances.  
During one such performance, at the 1994 Praise Gathering in Indianapolis, Indiana, Bill Gaither and Mark Lowry concocted a surprise for Danny and those in attendance.  Lowry walked down from the stage to the audience during "The Longer I Serve Him," and tapped Danny to sing a verse, which moved both the audience and the other Homecoming performers to tears.
Danny continued to join the Homecoming group whenever his health permitted, even after he was diagnosed with lymphoma, which he battled for five years before succumbing to the disease on April 6, 2001.
Danny Gaither was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Association's Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame (Pigeon Forge, TN)[tpl]cite web|last=staff|title=Danny Gaither|url=http://www.sgma.org/inductee_bios/danny_gaither.htm|work=Hall of Fame|publisher=Southern Gospel Music Association|accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl]  in 2010.

The Powderhorn is an important watershed for the Gunnison River. The area protects the East, Middle, and West forks of Powderhorn Creek which flows north directly to the Gunnison River. Calf Creek, which is on National Forest land flows south and eventually joins the Lake Fork River that also flows into the Gunnison via Lake City. Within the area there are numerous small lakes and beaver ponds. The largest of these are Devil's Lake and Powderhorn Lake.

[[Dragon's breath]]
CATEGORIES: Shotgun shells, Magnesium

Dragon's breath is an exotic incendiary round for a 12 gauge shotgun. Dragon's breath consists primarily of magnesium pellets/shards. When the round is fired, sparks and flames can shoot out to about 100 ft. Dragons breath is normally chambered in 12 gauge 2 3/4" shot shell. The rounds are safe to fire out of an improved cylinder bore as well as a modified choke barrel, common on many shotguns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_9_50/ai_n6125526 |title=Of Dragon's Breath and hammer-shells |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07[/tpl]
While its actual professional combat or tactical usage remains undocumented, the visual effect it produces is impressive and entertaining, similar to that of a short-ranged flamethrower or fireworks, making it popular among gun enthusiasts. Also undocumented, it has been claimed by enthusiasts that the rounds are often used as a distress signal, similar to a very short duration emergency flare gun, though some would argue a flare would be better fitted for such. The round has also been used for intimidation purposes.  The pyrotechnic shell is expensive compared to other shells, costing $5 (USD) per round.  There is little or no record of its use in actual combat. Because it is a very low-power round, it cannot be used in an auto-loading shotgun or semi-automatic shotgun; it does not produce enough recoil energy to cycle the action, causing the mechanism to fail to cycle. An additional reason to use the round only in a manually operated firearm is that the round shoots at least a little flame for 3–5 seconds.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] It would be hazardous if a shell still emitting flame were to be ejected from a semi-automatic shotgun.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

The program is directed and produced by Antonio Ricci and is hosted by two major comedians. Usually Ezio Greggio (who co-founded the show with Gianfranco D'Angelo) is assisted by another comedian (such as Enzo Iacchetti or Michelle Hunziker) for the winter season, after which there is a change of guard.

[[Sound 80]]

CATEGORIES: History of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Recording studios in the United States

Sound80 is a recording studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States founded by Tom Jung and Herb Pilhofer in 1969.  Largely involved with local artists, the studio is best known for recording portions of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks in 1974, but also made what is believed to be the first digital audio recording to be commercially released.  Jung and Pilhofer had previously worked at the Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis, where artists such as Dave Dudley and The Trashmen had recorded.  The name came from advertising man Brad Morrison, who had previously named Hormel's Cure 81 ham product (supposedly while drinking Vat 69 Scotch).[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
3M, based in neighboring Saint Paul, Minnesota, brought in a prototype digital recording system in 1977 or 1978.  Nicknamed "Herbie" after Herb Pilhofer, the system was used for two recordings by the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and one for jazz group Flim and the BB's.  One of the SPCO albums won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Orchestra Recording in 1979.  Being a prototype, it was a very bulky and finicky system.  For example, it used wire wrap boards and few, if any, soldered connections.  When it worked, the system had a number of good qualities.  However, there was no editing ability for digital media at the time, so even minor flaws would require the whole track to be re-recorded.
Tom Jung left the company to work in New York City, but created a mobile recording unit known as Road 80, which was rented to Sound 80 studios on occasion.  Jung later created the company DMP Digital Music Products, which also pushed the envelope of later digital audio technology (the company recorded the first multi-channel Super Audio CD).
In the mid 1980s the building became the home to AVC Systems, one of the largest pro audio contractors in the midwest.  The basement, including the live echo chamber, was converted into a staging area for system fabrication.  The main studio was converted to a showroom and office facilities.  The smaller studio was rented by "Roger Dodger Music", a Minneapolis based keyboard/synthesizer dealer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2007[/tpl]
The Sound 80 building was sold around 1990, but the original recording studio still exists and is now home to Orfield Labs who operate an Eckel Industries-designed anechoic chamber.  At −9.4 dB, it is listed as "the quietest place on Earth" by the Guinness Book of World Records. Sound 80 was listed in Guinness again in 2006 as the "Oldest Digital Recording Studio in the World".

Krrish ([tpl]IPA-hns|ˈkrɪʃ|[/tpl]) is a 2006 Indian science fiction superhero film directed, produced, and written by Rakesh Roshan, and starring Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah. It is the second film in the Krrish series, being the sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya, and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of "Krrish" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Siddhant.
Krrish was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert Tony Ching.

"Khan Bahadur" Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara CIE OBE ISO JP IP ([tpl]lang-gu|કાવસજી જમશેદજી પેટીગરા[/tpl]) (24 November 1877 – 28 March 1941) was the first Indian to become the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Mumbai Police in 1928. He was in charge of the Crime Branch division and was noted for his intelligence network. A decorated officer, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), Companion of the Indian Empire (CIE) and awarded the King's Police Medal. Petigara was also awarded the Imperial Service Order.  He was called by the honorific title "Khan Bahadur".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeoutmumbai.net/aroundtown/aroundtown_feature_details.asp?code=55|title=Figureheads|last=Basu|first=Poulomi|date=2008-08-22|work=Time Out Mumbai|accessdate=2008-09-03[/tpl] He joined the police force as a sub-inspector at the CID (Criminal Investigations Department), and gradually rose through the ranks. In 1928, he was promoted to the Indian Police Service rank, once that very few Indians achieved in those days.
Among his accomplishments was his role in foiling an attempt by Indian freedom activist Manabendra Nath Roy in toppling the government. Despite being a staunch loyalist of the British Indian government, he was respected by Indian freedom fighters. When Mahatma Gandhi applied for a passport in 1931 to attend the second Round Table Conference in London, Petigara was cited as one of his references. He retired from the police force in 1936.
On 1940-06-08 a statue of him was erected for the "valuable services rendered to the city". The statue is located near Metro Adlabs in South Mumbai. He died on 28 March 1941.

[[Microthread]]

CATEGORIES: Threads (computing)

Microthreads are small code fragments that can be run concurrently to gain increased performance in microprocessors.  They provide an execution model that uses a few additional instructions in a conventional processor to break code down into fragments that execute simultaneously. Dependencies are managed by making registers in the microprocessors executing the code synchronising, so one microthread will wait for another to produce data. 
This is a form of dataflow. This model can be applied to an existing instruction set architecture incrementally by providing just 5 new instructions to implement concurrency controls. A set of microthreads is a static partition of a basic block into concurrently executing fragments, which execute on a single processor and share a microcontext. An iterator over a set provides a dynamic and parametric family of microthreads. Iterators capture loop concurrency and can be scheduled to different processors. An iterator over a set is created dynamically and is called a family of microthreads. This is the mechanism that allows the model to generate concurrency, which can be run on multiple processors or functional units.

The White Company is a historical adventure by Arthur Conan Doyle set during the Hundred Years' War.Facsimile of the 1st edition (1891) The story is set in England, France, and Spain, in the years 1366 and 1367, against the background of the campaign of Edward, the Black Prince to restore Peter of Castile to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile. The climax of the book occurs before the Battle of Nájera. Doyle became inspired to write the novel after attending a lecture on the Middle Ages in 1889.

Elahieh (also spelt Elahiyeh; [tpl]lang-fa|الهیه[/tpl]) is an affluent and upper-class district in northern Tehran. The area is a residential and commercial locale and is filled with the homes and businesses of many politicians, diplomats, expatriates, and artists. 
The most famous part of the district is Fereshteh Street, which has been the most expensive street in Tehran. This is where the newest buildings and many fashionable locales, including top-end shops and chichi cafes, can be found. Fereshteh used to be one of the most quiet and peaceful part of northern Tehran but has seen significant development and real estate investment after the Islamic revolution, especially during a construction boom in the 1990s, when Gholamhossein Karbaschi and Ghalibaaf served as mayor of Tehran. During this boom, many of the huge gardens and large houses were replaced with the most fashionable high rises which has increased the population of this area significantly.  This has caused problems for narrow alleys around this area; the traffic often gets gridlocked on summer nights. 
In the book The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, Hooman Majd says that Elahieh is one of Tehran's "most fashionable districts" in Tehran, since this area included big gardens and mansions with eye catching architecture designs. It was perhaps the greenest part of northern Tehran as it was receiving most of mountain waters. The highest part of Elahieh had the most beautiful and scenic garden view in northern Tehran.

Chandrabindu (meaning "moon-dot" in Sanskrit, alternatively spelled candrabindu, chandravindu, candravindu, or chôndrobindu) is a diacritic sign having the form of a dot inside the lower half of a circle. It is used in the Devanagari (ँ), Bengali ([tpl]Lang|bn|ঁ[/tpl]), Gujarati (ઁ), Oriya ([tpl]Unicode|ଁ[/tpl]), Telugu (ఁ), and Javanese (ꦀ) scripts.
It usually means that the previous vowel is nasalized. It is represented in Unicode as U+0901 in Devanagari, U+0981 in Bengali, U+0A81 in Gujarati, U+0B01 in Oriya, U+0C01 in Telugu and U+A980 in Javanese.  There is also a general-purpose combining diacritical mark COMBINING CANDRABINDU code point U+0310 ([tpl]Unicode|◌̐[/tpl]), but this is intended for use with Latin letters in transliteration of Indic languages.
In Hindi, it is replaced in writing by anusvara when it is written above a consonant which carries a vowel symbol which extends above the top line.
In Classical Sanskrit it only seems to occur over a lla conjunct consonant, to show that it is pronounced as a nasalized double l, which occurs where -nl- have become assimilated in sandhi.
In Vedic Sanskrit it is used instead of anusvara to represent the sound called anunaasika when the next word starts with a vowel. It usually occurs where in earlier times a word ended in -ans.

Abu Al-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Othman (c. 1297 – May 24, 1351) ([tpl]Lang-ar|أبو الحسن علي بن عثمان[/tpl]) was a sultan of the Marinid dynasty who reigned in what is now Morocco between 1331 and 1348.  In 1333 he captured Gibraltar from the Castilians, although a later attempt to take Tarifa in 1339 ended in fiasco.  In North Africa he extended his rule over Tlemcen and Ifriqiya, which together covered the north of what is now Algeria and Tunisia. Under him the Marinid realms in the Maghreb briefly covered an area that rivaled that of the preceding Almohad Caliphate.  However, he was forced to retreat due to a revolt of the Arab tribes, was shipwrecked, and lost many of his supporters. His son Abu Inan Faris seized power in Fez. Abu Al-Hasan died in exile in the High Atlas mountains.

The Devil and Kate, Op. 112, B.201, (Čert a Káča in Czech) is an opera in three acts by Antonín Dvořák to a Czech libretto by Adolf Wenig.  It is based on a farce by Josef Kajetán Tyl, and the story also had been treated in the Fairy Tales of Božena Němcová.  The first performance of the opera was at the National Theatre, Prague, on 23 November 1899, under Adolf Čech.
The Devil and Kate is one of the few operas of Dvořák, along with Rusalka, to have remained in the repertory.  This can be attributed to the high demand for Italian grand operas in his time and the difficulties of Dvořák's intricate staging.  The opera has great appeal because of its combination of fairy tale and folk music; it is very close in feel to a Czech tone poem.  At times, it feels like a Czech version of Hansel & Gretel.  The overture was written after the opera itself.
John Clapham has written critical analysis of the opera and noted the presence of the style of Wagnerian declamation in the work.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://jrma.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/84/1/55 |last=Clapham |first=John | title=The Operas of Antonín Dvořák | journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association | volume=84 | issue=1 | pages=55–70 | year=1957 | accessdate=2007-09-03 | doi=10.1093/jrma/84.1.55[/tpl]

[[Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art]]
CATEGORIES: Art museums established in 1998, Art museums and galleries in London, Modern art museums, Museums in Islington, 1998 establishments in England

The Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art is a museum in Canonbury Square in the district of Islington on the northern fringes of central London. It is the United Kingdom's only gallery devoted to modern Italian art.
The Estorick Collection was founded by American sociologist and writer Eric Estorick (1913–93), who began to collect art when he moved to England after the Second World War. Estorick and his German-born English wife Salome (1920–1989) discovered Umberto Boccioni’s book Futurist Painting and Sculpture (1914) while they were on their honeymoon in 1947. Before the end of their trip they visited erstwhile Futurist Mario Sironi in Milan and bought most of the contents of his studio, including hundreds of drawings. They built up the collection mainly between 1953 and 1958. The collection was shown in several temporary exhibitions, including one at the Tate Gallery in London in 1956, and the key works were on long term loan to the Tate from 1966 to 1975. The Estoricks rejected offers to purchase their collection from the Italian government and museums in the United States and Israel. Six months prior to his death Eric Estorick set up the Eric and Salome Estorick Foundation, to which he donated all his Italian works. The Estorick Collection moved to its current premises in Northumberland Lodge, previously the home and office of Sir Basil Spence, the British architect, a converted Grade II-listed Georgian house, in 1998. The project was supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The core of the collection is its Futurist works, but it also includes figurative art and sculpture dating from 1890 to the 1950s. It features paintings by Futurism's main protagonists: Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Luigi Russolo and Ardengo Soffici, works by Giorgio de Chirico, Amedeo Modigliani, Giorgio Morandi, Mario Sironi and Marino Marini, and a number of paintings and sculptures by contemporary English artists including Edward Dutkiewicz. In addition to the main displays from the permanent collection, the Estorick Gallery organises temporary exhibitions, both in its own galleries, and on tour.

The Jacobin (Jakobín in Czech) is an opera in three acts by Antonín Dvořák to an original Czech libretto by Marie Červinková-Riegrová. Červinková-Riegrová took some of the story's characters from the story by Alois Jirásek, "At the Ducal Court", but devised her own plot around them.  The first performance was at the National Theatre, Prague, 1889.  Červinková-Riegrová revised the libretto, with Dvořák's permission, in 1894, notably in the last act.  Dvořák himself revised the music in 1897 (the revised premiere was on 19 June 1898, under Adolf Čech).  
The composer felt great affection for the subject of the opera, as the central character is a music teacher, and Dvořák had in mind his former teacher Antonin Liehmann, who had a daughter named Terinka, the name of one of the opera's characters.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://jrma.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/84/1/55 |last=Clapham |first=John | title=The Operas of Antonín Dvořák | journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association | volume=84 | issue=1 | pages=55–70 | date=1957 | accessdate=2007-09-03 | doi=10.1093/jrma/84.1.55[/tpl]

The picture was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited 1955 novel Do Re Mi by Garson Kanin. The movie was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music.

[[Alençon lace]]
CATEGORIES: Lace, Textile arts of France, Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity

Alençon lace or point d'Alençon is a needle lace that originated in Alençon, France. It is sometimes called the "Queen of lace." Lace making began in Alençon during the 16th century and the local industry was rapidly expanded during the reign of Louis XIV by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who established a Royal Workshop in the town to produce lace in the Venetian style in 1665.  The purpose of establishing this workshop was to reduce the French court's dependence on expensive foreign imports.  The local lacemakers soon modified the Venetian technique and Alençon emerged as a unique style around 1675.
Though the demand for lace went into sharp decline following the French Revolution, it recovered some of its popularity during the Second French Empire. Marie-Azélie Guérin Martin,Shrine Louis and Zelie Martin (Alençon-France) - Zelie Martin's life the mother of St. ThereseShrine Louis and Zelie Martin (Alençon-France) - St. Therese's life of Lisieux was a famous lace-maker at Alençon. It entered terminal decline at the end of the 19th century with changes in fashion and the development of cheaper, machine-made lace.
Lace making survived on a small scale and the technique was preserved by Carmelite nuns in Alençon.  In 1976 a National Lace Workshop was established in the town to ensure that this lace-making technique survives.  There is a permanent exhibition of lace and a display showing how it is made in the Musée des Beaux Arts et de la Dentelle, located in the town centre and adjoining the Workshop.  The workshops themselves are open to the public only on certain days of the year.
UNESCO recognised the unusual craftsmanship of this lace and added it to its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/forty_six_new_elements_added_to_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/|title= Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl] in November 2010.

The Pizarro brothers were Spanish conquistadors who came to Peru in 1532. They all were born in Trujillo, Extremadura, Spain.
The four brothers were:
All of them played a major part in the capture (1531–38) and rule of Peru. However, after the death of legal governor Francisco, their legitimate claims were practically forfeit. Juan had died during the ten month-long siege of Cuzco and Hernando was sent back as envoy to Spain and imprisoned in 1540, after accusations of corruption and tax evasion pointed towards the Pizarro administration. After Francisco's assassination in 1541, power was usurped by Cristóbal Vaca de Castro as new governor of "New Castile". In 1544 the king of Spain, who had also granted Francisco governorship in 1528, sent his own envoy Blasco Núñez Vela, as viceroy of Peru. Blasco imprisoned Castro but was the very same year detained and later killed on the behalf of Gonzalo Pizarro, who gathered his supporters and seized much of Peru. When Blasco's successor, Pedro de la Gasca defeated and had Gonzalo executed in 1548, the reign of the Pizarro brothers had definitely passed.

Destiny (also known as Fate, [tpl]lang-cs|Osud[/tpl]) is an opera in three acts by Leoš Janáček to a Czech libretto by the composer and Fedora Bartošová.  Janáček began the work in 1903 and completed it in 1907.  The inspiration for the opera came from a visit by Janáček in the summer of 1903, after the death of his daughter Olga, to the spa at Luhačovice.  There, Janáček met Kamila Urválková, who had been the subject of an opera by Ludvík Čelanský, Kamila, where she felt that Čelanský had falsely depicted her personality.  After learning that Janáček was a composer, Urválková persuaded Janáček to write another opera to counteract Čelanský's portrait of her.Tyrrell, John, "Janáček's Fate" (January 1972).  The Musical Times, 113 (1547): pp. 34–37.
Janáček submitted the opera to the Brno Theatre in 1906, and to the Vinohrady Theatre in Prague in 1907, but both theatres rejected the score.  The score stayed with the Vinohrady Theatre even after Janáček had threatened lawsuits against the theatre and after the Brno theatre made offers of a possible production.
The work did not receive a hearing until after Janáček's death, in 1934 on Brno Radio.

[tpl]Janacek operas|italic title=force[/tpl]The Excursions of Mr. Brouček to the Moon and to the 15th Century (Czech: Výlety páně Broučkovy) is the complete title of Leoš Janáček’s fifth opera, based on two Svatopluk Čech novels, Pravý výlet pana Broučka do Měsíce (1888) (The True Excursion of Mr. Brouček to the Moon) and Nový epochální výlet pana Broučka, tentokráte do XV. století (1889) ('‘The Epoch-making Excursion of Mr. Brouček, this time to the 15th Century'’). The librettists for Part 1 were František Gellner, Viktor Dyk, František Sarafínský Procházka and others, while Part 2 was written by F. S. Procházka.Holden, p. ?
This two-part satirical opera was premiered at the National Theatre in Prague on April 23, 1920, the only Janáček opera not premiered in Brno.Tyrell, New Grove Dictionary, pp. 1–3Cooper, p.3
Mr. Brouček (translated as “Mr. Beetle” (literally little beetle)) is a Philistine landlord in Prague who experiences a series of fantastic events as he is swept away (due in large part to excessive drinking) first to the moon and then to 15th-century Prague, during the Hussite uprising against the Holy Roman Empire in 1420 (see Synopsis). In both excursions, Brouček encounters characters who are transformed versions of his earthly acquaintances.Nigel Simeone. The Excursions of Mr Brouček. CD Liner Notes. London: The BBC, 2007), pp. 5–10.
Due to the popularity of the original novels by the iconic Czech writer, Svatopluk Čech, the opera was met with much scrutiny. Janáček experienced a number of setbacks in the creation and rehearsal of the work, especially in dealing with librettists (See Background).Vogel, pp. 237–238. The composer’s aim in The Excursions of Mr. Brouček was apparently quite specific: “I want us to be disgusted with such people, to stamp on them and strangle them when we meet them,”Shawe-Taylor, p. 59 speaking of Brouček. Janáček’s campaign, along with Čech’s, was against the pettiness of the bourgeoisie, specifically of Czechoslovakia. However, according to Desmond Shawe-Taylor, who saw the opera performed in Czechoslovakia, most observers reacted with cheerful laughter and even felt a bit sorry for the poor fellow Brouček. He became almost lovable rather than despised, as Janáček had originally intended, and his shortcomings, failings, and ordinariness tend to be seen as qualities common to regular citizens of all lands.

The Atlantique Incident  was an event in which a Pakistan Navy's Naval Air Arm Breguet Atlantique patrol plane, carrying 16 people on board, was shot down by the Indian Air Force for alleged violation of airspace. The episode took place in the Rann of Kutch on 10 August 1999, just a month after the Kargil War, creating a tense atmosphere between India and Pakistan.
Foreign diplomats based in Pakistan and escorted to the site by the Pakistani Army noted that the plane may have crossed the border. However, the Islamabad based diplomats said that they also believe that India's reaction was unjustified. Pakistan later lodged a compensation claim at the International Court of Justice, accusing India for the incident, but the court dismissed the case, ruling that the court had no jurisdiction in this matter.

CATEGORIES: Electoral divisions of the Northern Territory

Port Darwin is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. It was first created in 1974, and is an entirely urban electorate, covering only 11 km² and taking in the Darwin central business district, as well as the suburb of Larrakeyah and part of Stuart Park. There were 4,730 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012.
Port Darwin has almost always been a safe seat for the Country Liberal Party, although it was one of only two seats the party did not hold in the first parliament from 1974 to 1977. It was widely considered as CLP heartland, and was their safest seat in Darwin for many years. After the Australian Labor Party victory at the 2001 election, it became the only CLP-held seat west of Palmerston, and the strength of the CLP vote in the seat was seen at the 2000 by-election caused by the resignation of controversial former Chief Minister Shane Stone, when a struggling CLP still managed to easily fend off any challenge in the seat. As a result, there were very few signs in the lead-up to the 2005 election that sitting member Sue Carter was in danger, with most commentators expecting her to win another term. However, on election day, there was a surprise significant and unprecedented swing to the ALP across the Territory. Though the result was so close that it was not known for several days after the election, Carter was ultimately defeated by Labor opponent Kerry Sacilotto, who held the seat until the 2008 election, when Port Darwin returned to the CLP.

[[Seyahatname]]

CATEGORIES: Turkish literature, Travel books, 17th-century books, Ottoman literature

Seyâhatnâme (Persian: سياحت نامه, "book of travels") is the name of a literary form and tradition whose examples can be found throughout centuries in the Middle Ages around the Islamic world, starting with the Arab travellers of the Umayyad period. In a more specific sense, the name refers to the travel notes by the Ottoman Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi (1611–1682).
The Seyahâtnâme of Evliya Çelebi is an outstanding example of this tradition. Evliya was an Ottoman Turkish traveller, and the ten-volume Seyahâtnâme narrates his travels, starting in his native city of Constantinople and covering Anatolia, Safavid Persia, Ottoman Europe, North Africa, Austria and Cairo. Because of the value of his work, the generic term of Seyâhatnâme is often refer to Evliya Çelebi's books in particular, as far as the Turkish language and studies are concerned.
A related genre, specific to the journeys and experiences of Ottoman ambassadors, is the sefâretnâme (سفارت نامه), whose examples were edited by their authors with a view to their presentation to the Sultan and the high administration, thus also bearing a semi-official character, although they remained of interest for the general reader as well.

[[Small supernumerary marker chromosome]]
CATEGORIES: Chromosomes

Humans typically have 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes in their cells, and a pair of sex chromosomes. About 2.7 million individuals have an extra, 47th autosomal chromosome called a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). These small supernumerary marker chromosomes can originate from any of the 24 different human chromosomes. About 70% of the cases with sSMC are de novo (new mutations), 30% are inherited within a family.
About 30% of the carriers of a sSMC are clinically abnormal. The main problem in connection with a sSMC appears when the diagnosis of the presence of a sSMC is made prenatally. Until recently there was no possibility to make clear predictions about the outcome of the pregnancy. However,  research is being carried out into the link between the presence of a sSMC in individuals and any consequent symptoms.

Narrated by Diane Keaton, it stars Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler as three divorced women who seek revenge on their ex-husbands who left them for younger women. Stephen Collins, Victor Garber and Dan Hedaya co-star as the husbands, and Sarah Jessica Parker, Marcia Gay Harden and Elizabeth Berkley as their lovers, with Maggie Smith, Bronson Pinchot and Stockard Channing also starring. Scott Rudin produced and Hugh Wilson directed; the film was distributed by Paramount Pictures.
The film became a surprise box-office hit following its North American release, eventually grossing $181,490,000 worldwide, mostly from its domestic run, despite receiving mixed reviews. It developed a cult following among middle-aged women,Elizabeth Gleick. "Hell Hath No Fury" Time magazine.

[[APX]]

CATEGORIES: Complexity classes, Approximation algorithms

In complexity theory the class APX (an abbreviation of "approximable") is the set of NP optimization problems that allow polynomial-time approximation algorithms with approximation ratio bounded by a constant (or constant-factor approximation algorithms for short). In simple terms, problems in this class have efficient algorithms that can find an answer within some fixed percentage of the optimal answer. For example, there is a polynomial-time algorithm which will find a solution to the bin packing problem that uses at most 5% more than the smallest possible number of bins.
An approximation algorithm is called a c-approximation algorithm for some constant c if it can be proven that the solution that the algorithm finds is at most c times worse than the optimal solution. Here, c is called the approximation ratio. Depending on whether the problem is a minimization or a maximization problem, this can either denote c times larger or c times smaller, respectively. For example, the vertex cover problem and traveling salesman problem with triangle inequality each have simple 2-approximation algorithms. In contrast, it's proven that the traveling salesman problem with arbitrary edge-lengths can not  be approximated with approximation ratio bounded by a constant as long as the Hamiltonian-path problem can not be solved in polynomial time, that is unless P = NP.
If there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve a problem within every fixed percentage greater than zero (one algorithm for each percentage), then the problem is said to have a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). Unless P=NP, it can be shown that there are problems that are in APX but not in PTAS; that is, problems that can be approximated within some constant factor, but not every constant factor. A problem is said to be APX-hard if there is a PTAS reduction from every problem in APX to that problem, and to be APX-complete if the problem is APX-hard and also in APX.  As a consequence of P ≠ NP ⇒ PTAS ≠ APX, P ≠ NP ⇒ no APX-hard problem is in PTAS.
To say a problem is APX-hard is generally bad news, because if P ≠ NP, it denies the existence of a PTAS, which is the most useful sort of approximation algorithm. One of the simplest APX-complete problems is the maximum satisfiability problem, a variation of the boolean satisfiability problem. In this problem, we have a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form, and we wish to know the maximum number of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by a single assignment of true/false values to the variables. Despite the fact that it probably does not have a PTAS, however, the correct answer can still be estimated within 30%, and some simplified variants do have a PTAS.

HLMs constitute 16% of all housing in France.10 idées reçues sur les HLM, Union sociale pour l'habitat, February 2012 There are approximately four million such residences, housing an estimated 10 million people. The standard of living in the HLM housing projects is often the lowest in the country. 
72% of ancient HLM (and 95% of new HLM) are small buildings or individual houses. The average size of buildings is 20 apartments. Construction of HLM is mainly financed by funds collected on Livret A, a type of savings account regulated by the Caisse des dépôts et consignations.

National Secretary Paddy Crumlin was recently elected as the President of the ITF and also holds the position of chair of the Dockers Section.
The union resulted from a 1993 merger of the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation, both unions with a strong class sense and history of political and industrial action in the Australian labour movement. Both unions were involved in early maritime disputes in 1878 and the 1890 Australian maritime dispute.

Dzi bead (Tib. གཟི།; pronounced "zee"; alternative spelling: gzi) is a type of stone bead of uncertain origin worn as part of a necklace and sometimes as a bracelet. In several Asian cultures, including that of Tibet, the bead is considered to provide positive spiritual benefit.  These beads are generally prized as protective amulets and are sometimes ground up into a powder to be used in traditional Tibetan medicine.  Beads subject to this process have small "dig marks" where a portion of the bead has been scraped or shaved away to be ground into the medicine.
The most highly prized dzi beads are those of ancient age, made of natural agate. It is a mystery were where these beads originated. While the traditional, ancient-style beads are greatly preferred, new modern-made dzi are gaining popularity amongst Tibetans.

The opera was intended by Martinů, who was then living in Paris, for performance at the Paris World Exhibition of 1937. However, various delays (including the intervening World War II) prevented its performance during the composer's lifetime.
The opera's first performance was given at the Opera House, Mannheim, on 18 February 1964, when it was conducted by Georg Calder. Shortly afterwards it was given its first performance in Martinů's native Czechoslovakia by the Brno Janáček Opera. 
The opera is subtitled 'The Tragedy of a Man who Had His Beard Cut', and the surrealist libretto is set in Paris about 1900. Although Martinů had asked Wurmser for a libretto including a singing cat, he compromised on Wurmser's suggestion of a singing portrait, which acts as narrator to a tale of bourgeois infidelity.

The Dionysian Mysteries were a ritual of ancient Greece and Rome which used intoxicants and other trance-inducing techniques (like dance and music) to remove inhibitions and social constraints, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. It also provided some liberation for those marginalized by Greek society: women, slaves and foreigners. In their final phase the Mysteries shifted their emphasis from a chthonic, underworld orientation to a transcendental, mystical one, with Dionysus changing his nature accordingly (similar to the change in the cult of Shiva). By its nature as a mystery religion reserved for the initiated, many aspects of the Dionysian cult remain unknown and were lost with the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism; our knowledge is derived from descriptions, imagery and cross-cultural studies.

The series is named for its current sponsor, the Sprint Corporation, and has been known by other names in the past. It was originally known as the Strictly Stock Series (1949) and shortly became the Grand National Series (1950–1970). While leasing its naming rights to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was known as the Winston Cup Series (1971–2003).

The name "Sprint" refers specifically to the subsidiary of Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank which is the entitlement sponsor; sprint car racing is a separate racing discipline.
The drivers' champion is determined by a point system where points are given according to finishing placement and laps led. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins and compete in the last 10 races with the difference in points greatly minimized. This is called the Chase for the Championship.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html |title=NASCAR Announces Chase for the Sprint Cup Format Change |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl]
The series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States with half of its 36-race season in that region. The current schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia.

Brendan Michael Smyth (born 27 July 1959) is a Liberal Party of Australia politician. From 2002 to 2006 he was  the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Capital Territory.   He retains his shadow previous portfolios of Health, Ageing, Business and Tourism at present.
He also served briefly as Deputy Chief Minister in 2000.
 He represents the electorate of [[Brindabella electorate|Brindabella]].
Smyth was born in Sydney, but moved to Canberra in May 1969. He worked at the National Library of Australia until 25 March 1995, when he ran for the Liberal Party in a by-election for the federal House of Representatives seat of Canberra. Normally a safe Labor seat, its previous member Ros Kelly had left under a cloud, having been forced to resign her ministry a year earlier over the sports rorts affair, and Smyth received a 16.1% swing to claim the seat. At the Australian federal election on 2 March 1996, Smyth contested the new federal House of Representatives seat of Namadgi, even though it had been drawn with a notional Labor majority of 10.9 percent.http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1996/1996repsact.txt He was defeated by Annette Ellis in what proved to be the only gain by Labor in that election.[tpl]cite web  | last =  Green| first = Antony|  year = 2007 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/guide/canb.htm  | title = Canberra (electorate) | work = Australia Votes 2007: Electorate profiles | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 2007-11-14[/tpl]

[[Charles W. King]]

CATEGORIES: Japan–United States relations

Charles W. King was an American merchant in Canton, China, who is famous for having tried to open trade with Japan on the pretext of repatriating seven Japanese castaways, among them Otokichi, to their homeland in 1837 in the Morrison Incident.Cullen, L.M. (2003). A History of Japan, 1582-1941: Internal and External Worlds. pp. 158, 179.  
In July 1837, Charles W. King set off with the seven Japanese aboard an American merchant ship called the SS Morrison, on which he sailed to Uraga at the entrance of Edo Bay. The ship had been disarmed to signify its peaceful intentions.
Cannon were fired from the hilltops of the Miura Peninsula as soon as the ship approached Uraga, in compliance with the 1825–42 Shogunal order that any approaching Western ships, apart from Dutch ones, should be fired upon.
King anchored at a safe distance, out of range of the shore batteries. Men from several small fishing ships boarded the SS Morrison, and sake and cookies were shared until late in the night. By daybreak, however, cannons had been brought closer to the seaside, and they were again fired at the ship. Hundreds of small boats, each with a small cannon at the front, also started to surround and attack the ship. The Morrison sailed away, with little damage.
King then sailed to Kagoshima in Kyūshū.Cullen, p. 172. The first day he met some officials there, who took two of the castaways into custody. The following day, a fisherman came alongside and warned the sailors to leave immediately. As the ship was setting its sails, the Japanese opened fire from cannons they had moved to the proximity of the ship during the night. King decided to abandon the mission and returned to Canton with the remaining castaways.
King was outraged by the Japanese response, and upon his return to the United States in 1839 wrote a book about his adventure. In the book he explained that the American flag had been fired upon by a foreign government and that the next contacts with Japan "had better be left to the stronger and wiser action of the American Government".
In 1845, a resolution was introduced to the United States Congress to open Japan to trade. Although the resolution was never passed, the United States government sent an expedition under James Biddle with two heavily armed ships, to induce Japan to negotiate.Sewall, John S. (1905).

The Nation of Yahweh is a predominantly African American group that is the most controversial offshoot of the Black Hebrew Israelites line of thought. It has often been labeled as a hate group and was founded in 1979 in Miami by Hulon Mitchell Jr., who went by the name Yahweh ben Yahweh. Its goal is to return African Americans, whom they see as the original Israelites, to Israel. The group departs from mainstream Christianity and Judaism by accepting Yahweh ben Yahweh as the Son of God. In this way, its beliefs are unique and distinct from that of other known Black Hebrew Israelite groups.[tpl]cite book |title= The New Religious Movements Experience in America |last=Gallagher |first=Eugene V. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location= |isbn=0-313-32807-2 |page=149 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=811 |title=Rebirth of A Nation |accessdate=2008-01-20 |format= |work= |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center [/tpl]  The group has engendered controversy due to legal issues of its founder and has also faced accusations of being a black supremacist cult by the Southern Poverty Law Center[ref]

[[Text linguistics]]

CATEGORIES: Applied linguistics, Discourse analysis, Systemic functional linguistics

Text linguistics is a branch of linguistics that deals with texts as communication systems. Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text grammars. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i.e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its addressee are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of discourse analysisTrappes-Lomax, Hugh (2004) "Discourse analysis", in The Handbook of Applied Linguistics ed. by A. Davies & C. Elder. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 133–64. at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word.

Its composition was brief in comparison with the fifteen years it took Brahms to complete his First Symphony. The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.[tpl]cite book|last=Brahms|first=Johannes|title=Johannes Brahms: Complete Symphonies in Full Score (Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Edition)|year=1974|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-23053-5|editor=Hans Gál|page=87[/tpl]
The cheery and almost pastoral mood of the symphony often invite comparisons with Beethoven's Sixth Symphony ,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] but, perhaps mischievously Brahms wrote to his publisher on November 22, 1877, that the symphony "is so melancholy that you will not be able to bear it.

The premiere was given in Vienna on December 30, 1877 by the Vienna Philharmonic under the direction of Hans Richter; Walter Frisch notes that it had originally been scheduled for December 9, but "in one of those little ironies of music history, it had to be postponed because the players were so preoccupied with learning Das Rheingold by Richard Wagner."Walter Frisch, Brahms: The Four Symphonies, New York, 1996: Schirmer Books, p. 68.

Louis Trolle Hjelmslev ([tpl]IPA-da|ˈjɛlˀmsleʊ|lang[/tpl]; October 3, 1899, Copenhagen – May 30, 1965, Copenhagen) was a Danish linguist whose ideas formed the basis of the Copenhagen School of linguistics. Born into an academic family (his father was the mathematician Johannes Hjelmslev), Hjelmslev studied comparative linguistics in Copenhagen, Prague and Paris (with a.o. Antoine Meillet and Joseph Vendryes). In 1931, he founded the Cercle Linguistique de Copenhague. Together with Hans Jørgen Uldall he developed a structural theory of language which he called glossematics, which developed the semiotic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure. Glossematics as a theory of language is characterized by a high degree of formalism, it is interested only in describing the formal characteristics of language, and a high degree of logical rigour. The theory never became widely influential, but has recently been picked up by post-structuralist philosophers as a possible alternative to the dominant Saussurean linguistic paradigm.[tpl]cite book|author=Fischer-Jørgensen, Eli|chapter=Louis Hjelmslev|title=Den Store Danske Encyklopædi, |publisher=Gyldendal|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Sprogforskeres_biografier/Louis_Hjelmslev[/tpl][tpl]da icon[/tpl]

[[Dialectology]]
CATEGORIES: Dialectology, Dialects

Dialectology (from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|διάλεκτος[/tpl], dialektos, "talk, dialect"; and [tpl]lang|grc|-λογία[/tpl], -logia) is the scientific study of linguistic dialect, a sub-field of sociolinguistics. It studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and synchronic variation.
Dialectologists are ultimately concerned with grammatical, lexical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas. Thus they usually deal not only with populations that have lived in certain areas for generations, but also with migrant groups that bring their languages to new areas (see language contact).
Commonly studied concepts in dialectology include the problem of mutual intelligibility in defining languages and dialects; situations of diglossia, where two dialects are used for different functions; dialect continua including a number of partially mutually intelligible dialects; and pluricentrism, where what is essentially a single genetic language exists as two or more standard varieties.
Hans Kurath and William Labov are among the most prominent researchers in this field.

[[Systemic functional linguistics]]
CATEGORIES: Linguistics, Systemic functional linguistics

Systemic functional linguistics (SFL) is an approach to linguistics that considers language as a social semiotic system. It was developed by Michael Halliday, who took the notion of system from his teacher, J. R. Firth. Whereas Firth considered systems to refer to possibilities subordinated to structure, Halliday in a certain sense "liberated" the dimension of choice from structure and made it the central organising dimension of this theory. In other words, whereas many approaches to linguistic description place structure and the syntagmatic axis in the foreground, Hallidean systemic functional theory adopts the paradigmatic axis as its point of departure. The term systemic accordingly foregrounds Saussure's "paradigmatic axis" in understanding how language works.Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi. For Halliday, a central theoretical principle is then that any act of communication involves choices. Language is a system, and the choices available in any language variety are mapped using the representation tool of the "system network". 
Systemic functional linguistics is also "functional" because it considers language to have evolved under the pressure of the particular functions that the language system has to serve. Functions are therefore taken to have left their mark on the structure and organisation of language at all levels, which is said to be achieved via metafunctions. The term metafunction is particular to systemic functional linguistics. The organisation of the functional framework around systems, i.e., choices, is a significant difference from other "functional" approaches, such as, for example, Dik's functional grammar (FG, or as now often termed, functional discourse grammar) and lexical functional grammar. Thus, it is important to use the full designation—systemic functional linguistics—rather than just functional grammar or functional linguistics.
For Halliday, all languages involve three generalised functions, or metafunctions: one construes experience (meanings about the outer and inner worlds); one enacts social relations (meanings concerned with interpersonal relations), and one weaves together of these two functions to create text (the wording). Because these functions are considered to come into being simultaneously—viz., one cannot mean about the world without having either a real or virtual audience—language must also be able to bring these meanings together: this is the role of structural organisation, be that grammatical, semantic or contextual. These three generalised functions are termed "metafunctions".Halliday, M.A.K. 1977. Text as semantic choice in social contexts. Reprinted in full in Linguistic Studies of Text and Discourse. Volume 2 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. Edited by J, J. Webster. London and New York: Continuum. pp. 23–81.

A Sea Symphony is a piece for orchestra and chorus by Ralph Vaughan Williams, written between 1903 and 1909. Vaughan Williams' first and longest symphony, it was first performed at the Leeds Festival in 1910, with the composer conducting. The symphony's maturity belies the composer's relative youth when it was written (he was 30 when he first began sketching it). One of the first symphonies in which a choir is used throughout the work and is an integral part of the musical texture, A Sea Symphony helped set the stage for a new era of symphonic and choral music in England during the first half of the 20th century. The work is sometimes referred to as the Symphony No. 1.

The Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which  created legal definitions of crofting parish and crofter, granted security of tenure to crofters and produced the first Crofters Commission, a land court which ruled on disputes between landlords and crofters. The same court ruled on whether parishes were or were not crofting parishes. In many respects the Act was modelled on the Irish Land Acts of 1870 and 1881.
The Act specified eight counties of Scotland as counties where parishes might be recognised as crofting parishes: Argyll, Caithness, Cromarty, Inverness, Orkney, Ross, Shetland, and Sutherland. Within these counties a crofting parish was a parish where there were year-by-year tenants of land (tenants without leases) who were paying less than £30 a year in rent and who had possessed effective common grazing rights during the 80 years since 24 June 1806.
The Act was largely a result of crofters' agitation which had become well organised and very persistent in Skye (then in the county of Inverness-shire) and of growing support, throughout the Highlands, for the Crofters' Party, which had gained five Members of Parliament in the general election of 1885. Agitation took the form of rent strikes (withholding rent payments) and what came to be known as land raids: crofter occupations of land to which crofters believed they should have access for common grazing or for new crofts, but which landlords had given over to sheep farming and hunting parks (called deer forests).
The Act itself did not quell the agitation. In particular it was very weak in terms of enabling the Crofters Commission to resolve disputes about access to land. It was enough however to make much more acceptable, politically, the use of troops in confrontations with agitators.

CATEGORIES: 1935 compositions, Symphonies by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Compositions in F minor

The Symphony No. 4 in F minor by Ralph Vaughan Williams was dedicated by the composer to Arnold Bax.
Unlike Vaughan Williams's first three symphonies it was not given a title, the composer stating that it was to be understood as pure music, without any incidental or external inspiration. 
In contrast to many of Vaughan Williams's previous compositions, the symphony displays a severity of tone. The composer himself once observed of it, "I'm not at all sure that I like it myself now. All I know is that it's what I wanted to do at the time." The British composer Sir William Walton admired the work greatly, speaking of it as "the greatest symphony since Beethoven". Only two symphonies of Vaughan Williams end loudly, No.4 and No.8.
The work was first performed on 10 April 1935 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult.  Its first recording, made two years later, featured the composer himself conducting the same orchestra in what proved to be his only commercial recording of any of his symphonies. It was released on 78-rpm discs in the U.K. by HMV and in the U.S. by RCA Victor, and has been reissued on LP and CD.Vaughan Williams conducts Vaughan Williams Amazon website. Retrieved 2011-07-10.
The U.S. Premiere was given on 19 December 1935 by Artur Rodzinski and the Cleveland Orchestra. The earliest American performance to have survived in recorded form was the broadcast of 14 March 1943 by the  NBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. It was the only time he conducted the work in his entire career and his performance has been issued on CD by Cala Records.

Bad Meets Evil is an American hip hop duo consisting of rappers Royce da 5'9" (Bad) and Eminem (Evil). Bad Meets Evil was formed in 1997 thanks to the duo's mutual friend Proof. It was formed after Royce featured on the song "Bad Meets Evil" for Eminem's major label debut The Slim Shady LP (1999). Their discography consists of one extended play and four singles. In 1999, the duo released a double non-album singles, "Nuttin' to Do" and "Scary Movies"; the former peaked at 36 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, while the latter peaked at 63 on the UK Singles Chart and was featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 horror comedy parody film Scary Movie.
The duo broke up after a feud between Royce and the members of Eminem's group D12. The feud ended when Proof, a D12 member and Eminem's best friend—as well as a friend of Royce's -- was murdered in 2006. After Royce's super-group Slaughterhouse signed to the Eminem-founded label Shady Records, a reunion of Bad Meets Evil followed with the extended play Hell: The Sequel (2011), which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The EP's lead single "Fast Lane" peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the second single "Lighters", featuring Bruno Mars, peaked at number four on the same chart.

The story describes the life of Som-Som, a prostitute in the House Without Clocks - a brothel designed to service rare and exotic tastes.  Som-Som has undergone a corpus callosotomy, severing the connection between the two hemispheres of her brain; this, in conjunction with the porcelain mask attached to the right half of her face, and the thick glove on her right hand, destroys the connections between her thoughts and actions. Therefore, she can see and hear, but not speak of or act on, any secrets her wizard clientele may inadvertently reveal in the throes of passion.  Consequently, Som-Som can only watch as her transsexual friend Rawra Chin is slowly destroyed by an abusive relationship.

A Face in the Crowd is a 1957 film starring Andy Griffith, Patricia Neal and Walter Matthau, directed by Elia Kazan.Variety film review; May 29, 1957, page 6.Harrison's Reports film review; June 1, 1957, page 88. The screenplay was written by Budd Schulberg, based on his short story "Your Arkansas Traveler", part of his 1953 short story collection, Some Faces in the Crowd..
The story centers on a drifter named Larry "Lonesome" Rhodes (Griffith, in a role starkly different from the amiable "Sheriff Andy Taylor" persona), who is discovered by the producer (Neal) of a small-market radio program in rural northeast Arkansas. Rhodes ultimately rises to great fame and influence on national television.
The film launched Griffith into stardom, but earned mixed reviews upon its original release. Later decades have seen reappraisals of the movie, and in 2008 A Face in the Crowd was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

[[MUD2]]
CATEGORIES: Role-playing video games, MUD games, Mainframe games

MUD2 is the successor of MUD1, Richard Bartle's pioneering Multi-User Dungeon. Rather than a sequel, it is the result of over 20 years of continuous development, and is still largely based on the game's original code. 
The game is nominally a roleplaying game, with a very strict set of rules, character classes and levels. Character progress up a ladder of 11 levels until they reach the traditional MUD goal of wiz (wizard or witch). 
Characters move between locations, or game rooms, using compass directions, and basic commands such as GET LONGSWORD, GET DIAMOND, KILL DWARF WITH LONGSWORD. Points are scored by dropping treasure in the room known as the swamp, killing an NPC, or killing another player. The game also includes magical powers, which are gained through a mystical artifact known as The Touchstone. The small side effect of this is that touching the Touchstone may kill you, with the likelihood of death decreasing as you get higher in level. In order to make Wiz, one must also complete seven of eight tasks. Among wizzes' many powers is the ability to instantly kill any player in the land, using the much-vaunted Finger of Death, or FOD. 
The game's levels are laid out as follows:
It is generally acknowledged that the biggest challenge in the game is other players, and highly skilled players that have made wiz will actively test "mortal" players to ensure they have the required level of skill to complete, and then manage the game.
Much of MUD2's long-running appeal comes from its much-celebrated depth, and its wide-ranging gameplay, as it contains large elements of puzzle-solving and exploration, as well as elements of skill, chance, and humour.

Bon Echo Provincial Park encompasses the central section of the lake, including the narrows between North and South Mazinaw and the Mazinaw Rock formation.  The lake's name comes from Mazinaabikinigan-zaaga'igan, meaning "painted-image lake" in Algonkian, referring to the pictographs on Mazinaw Rock which overlooks the lake. The Mazinaw Rock, located on the eastern side of North Mazinaw, features over 260 native pictographs- often confused with petroglyphs – the largest visible collection in Canada - including the Ojibwa trickster figure and culture hero, Nanabush. The rock also contains a tribute to Walt Whitman, inscribed for Flora MacDonald Denison, who ran the Bon Echo Inn on the site of the provincial park during the 1910s.
A dam is located at the outflow of the lake to maintain the level of the lake and to control water flow into the Mississippi River during the spring runoff time.
Mink can be spotted along the northern shores of the lake.

Filipendula is a genus of 12 species of perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Well-known species include Meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and Dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris), both native to Europe, and Queen-of-the-forest (Filipendula occidentalis) and Queen-of-the-prairie (Filipendula rubra), native to North America.
The species grow to between 0.5-2 m tall, with large inflorescences of small five-petalled flowers, creamy-white to pink-tinged in most species, dark pink in F. rubra. Filipendula fruit are unusual, sometimes described as an indehiscent follicle, or as an achene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=112789|title=Flora of China online[/tpl]
Filipendula species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species: Emperor Moth, Grey Pug, Grizzled Skipper, Hebrew Character, Lime-speck Pug, Mottled Beauty and The Satellite have all been recorded on Meadowsweet.
The species were in the past sometimes treated in a broad view of the genus Spiraea, but genetic research has shown that they are less closely related than previously considered.

Slotsholmen (English: The Castle Islet) is an island in the harbour of Copenhagen, Denmark, and part of Copenhagen Inner City. The name is taken from the successive castles and palaces located on the island since Bishop Absalon constructed the city's first castle on the island in 1167 at the site where Christiansborg Palace lies today.
Recognised as the centre of the Government of Denmark since the Middle Ages, the island is sometimes referred to as 'the Island of Power',Jytte Hilden: Slotsholmen, Magtens Ø. Copenhagen 2006. 202 p. and is lined with central government institutions and ministries; the name Slotsholmen is thus also frequently used as a metonym for overall Danish governmental administration.
The island is dominated by the vast Christiansborg Palace which houses the Danish Parliament, the Supreme Court of Denmark, the Prime Minister's Office and the State Rooms of the Queen. Also located on the island are the most important ministries, the Danish National Archives, the Royal Danish Library, several museums and the historic buildings of the Christian IV's Stock Exchange, the Chancellery and Christian IV's Brewhouse.Lars Bugge: Glemte broer i København

West Point (西角) was a point of land on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong.  Its location is the shore off the Pokfulam Road and Queen's Road West in 1845, approximately the junction of Western Street and Des Voeux Road West near the Western Police Station. This was the northernmost point on the western half of Hong Kong Island.
The Hong Kong Government divided the Victoria City into four wan (環), or districts.  While West Point falls into the Sai Wan, the Western District, major government structures like the police station and court are located near West Point.  Thus the name of Sai Wan, Western District, Western and West Point were sometimes used interchangeably.
St. Stephen’s Anglican Church located in West Point was founded by the Church Missionary Society (Church Mission Society)(CMS) in 1865.

Everything but Arms (EBA) is an initiative of the European Union under which all imports to the EU from the Least Developed Countries are duty-free and quota-free, with the exception of armaments. EBA entered into force on 5 March 2001. There are transitional arrangements for bananas, sugar and rice until January 2006, July 2009 and September 2009 respectively.  The EBA is part of the EU Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Therefore the legal text can be found in the GSP regulation, art 12 and 13.
Although the EBA program provides for duty-free imports from Least Developed Countries the Rules of Origin, especially pertaining to apparel, severely inhibit imports because all phases of production do not occur within Least Developed Countries.
The aim of the scheme is to encourage the development of the world's poorest countries.

A yad ([tpl]Lang-he|יד[/tpl]) ([tpl]Lang-yi|האַנט[/tpl]), literally, "hand," is a Jewish ritual pointer, popularly known as a Torah pointer, used by the reader to follow the text during the Torah reading from the parchment Torah scrolls. Beyond its practical usage, the yad ensures that the parchment is not touched during the reading.  There are several reasons for this: handling the parchment renders one ritually impure and the often-fragile parchment is easily damaged.  Moreover, the vellum parchment does not absorb ink so touching the scroll with fingers will damage the lettering.Torah, JewFAQ. Ref. Date= February 10, 2012. While not required when chanting from the Torah, it is used frequently and is considered a hidur mitzvah ("embellishment of the commandment" of reading the Torah).
A yad can be made of any number of materials, though silver is common, especially used in crowning the yad. The yad is often shaped like a long rod, capped by a small hand with its index finger pointing from it. In some cases a yad is covered with fabric.

[[Saxifraga flagellaris]]

CATEGORIES: Saxifraga, Arctic flora, Flora of Norway, Flora of Canada

Saxifraga flagellaris (Whiplash Saxifrage) is a plant native all over the high arctic and some areas of northern Rocky Mountains, and Norway. It is not very common. It is also known as Spider Saxifrage or "spider plant", though the latter name more commonly refers to the unrelated Chlorophytum comosum (Agavaceae).
The Broadsepal Saxifrage (S. platysepala) was formerly included in the present species, then made a separate species, and later again made a subspecies, Saxifraga flagellaris ssp. platysepala—broadsepal saxifrage (http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/itisca/next?v_tsn=24270&taxa=&p_format=&p_ifx=&p_lang=). The species found in Greenland, Svalbard, Alaska etc. is Saxifraga flagellaris ssp. platysepala—broadsepal saxifrage.
The stems are single, erect and leafy, growing to 3–10 cm tall. The basal leaves in a dense rosette from which long, filiform runners radiate ending in a small, rooting offset; they also have glandular hairs on the margins. Each stem usually has one terminal flower, rarely two, with golden yellow petals, much longer than the calyx lobes. The whole plant is more or less red. It grows in moist places, on gravel or in moss carpets.
It is not in any danger of extinction, but is yet very rare.

[[History of Spain (1814–73)]]
CATEGORIES: Modern history of Spain, 19th century in Spain

Spain in the 19th century was a country in turmoil. Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a massively destructive "war of independence" ensued, driven by an emergent Spanish nationalism. An era of reaction against the liberal ideas associated with revolutionary France followed the war, personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII and – to a lesser extent – his daughter Isabella II. Ferdinand's rule included the loss of the Spanish colonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s. A series of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans against conservatives, culminating in the Carlist Wars between the moderate Queen Isabella and her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos. Disaffection with Isabella's government from many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several revolutionary attempts against the government.  Two of these revolutions were successful, the moderate Vicalvarada or "Vicálvaro Revolution" of 1854 and the more radical la Gloriosa (Glorious Revolution) in 1868. The latter marks the end of  Isabella's monarchy. The brief rule of the liberal king Amadeo I of Spain ended in the establishment of the First Spanish Republic, only to be replaced in 1874 by the popular, moderate rule of Alfonso XII of Spain, which finally brought Spain into a period of stability and reform.

[[Twenty20 in England in 2005]]
CATEGORIES: 2005 in English cricket

Twenty20 cricket is played over 20 overs according to normal limited-over rules, the one exception being the rule for "timed out", where the time by which an incoming batsman must be at the crease ready to receive his first ball is reduced to 90 seconds after the outgoing batsman has been dismissed. This amendment to the rules helps speed up the game. Additionally, boundary ropes tend to be shorter in Twenty20 cricket than for normal limited over games.
2005 marks the third running of the Twenty20 Cup, which was won by Somerset when they beat Lancashire at the Oval on 30 July. It also saw England play their first Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, and winning by 100 runs (see below).
There was also a further development, as Leicestershire won approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board to host an International Twenty20 competition at the end of the season, although they are having to call it 20:20 to get round trademark issues. It will be competed over 15, 16 and 17 September between Leicestershire Foxes, Somerset Sabres, Nashua Titans, a Lashings World XI, the PCA Masters and the Asian XI.

Saxifraga oppositifolia, the purple saxifrage or purple mountain saxifrage,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=24230 |title=ITIS Standard Report Page: Saxifraga oppositifolia |publisher=Itis.gov |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=2013-10-25[/tpl] is a species of edible plant that is very common all over the high Arctic and also some high mountainous areas further south, including northern Britain, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains. It is even known to grow on Kaffeklubben Island in north Greenland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sagaxexpeditions.com/2US%20-%203.4%20Photos-Videos.html |title=Template |publisher=Sagaxexpeditions.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25[/tpl] at 83°40'N, the most northerly plant locality in the world.
It is a low-growing, densely or loosely matted plant growing to 3–5 cm high, with somewhat woody branches of creeping or trailing habit close to the surface. The leaves are small, rounded, scale-like, opposite in 4 rows, with ciliated margins. The flowers are solitary on short stalks, petals purple or lilac, much longer than the calyx lobes. It is one of the very first spring flowers, continuing to flower during the whole summer in localities where the snow melts later.  The flowers grow to about 0.5 inches in diameter.
It grows in all kinds of cold temperate to arctic habitats, from sea level up to 1000 m, in many places colouring the landscape. It is a popular plant in alpine gardens, though difficult to grow in warm climates.
It serves as the territorial flower of Nordland county in Norway, Nunavut in Canada and the county flower of County Londonderry in Northern Ireland.
The flowers can be picked for food. The semi-sweet petals are edible. The flower is known to the Inuit people as aupilaktunnguaq.
Swiss botanist Christian Körner found the plant growing at an elevation of 4,505 meters in the Swiss alps, making it the highest elevation angiosperm in Europe and most likely the world.Coldest places on earth with angiosperm plant life, Alpine Botany, Volume 121, Number 1, 11-22, [tpl]doi|10.1007/s00035-011-0089-1[/tpl]

[[Molasses Gang]]
CATEGORIES: Historical gangs of New York City

The Molasses Gang was a New York street gang during the 1870s. 
Formed in 1871 by Jimmy Dunnigan, the Molasses Gang were primarily made up of sneak thieves and minor criminals who were highly publicized in the New York press for the comedic methods of their robberies. One such tactic was to enter a local store and ask the owner to fill a member's hat with molasses, explaining that it was a bet among the other members to see how much molasses the hat would hold. When the hat was filled, the gang member would pull the hat over the shop-owner's head, blinding him while the gang members looted the store. The gang was not taken very seriously among the other gangs of the period, however, and often walked out in the middle of robberies when such activities bored them. As the gang continued to commit similar crimes, police decided to take action and by 1877 most of the gang had been arrested.

Ian David Austin (born 30 May 1966 in Haslingden, Lancashire, England) is a retired English cricketer.
He made his first-class debut for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1987 (having played a single Sunday League match for them the previous season) and remained with that county for his entire career, scoring 3,778 runs at 27.98 and taking 262 wickets at 30.35 with his medium-pace seamers in his 124 matches.
Enormously popular with the Lancashire crowd thanks to his uncomplicated batting style and equally old-fashioned waistline, his most successful period came towards the end of his career.  In 1998, he helped his county to both NatWest Trophy and Sunday League success. He then made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka later in the summer. For these performances he was made one of 1999's Wisden Cricketers of the Year.
Austin was selected for the 1999 World Cup squad, and opened the bowling with Darren Gough in England's opening game, taking 2-25 against Sri Lanka at Lord's. However, his international career was to last just one more match, against Kenya later in the same tournament. He spent the rest of his career at Lancashire, where his benefit in 2000 raised £155,000. Austin played no first-class cricket after early June 2001, but continued to appear in some one-day games for another year.
After a handful of appearances for Cumberland in 2002, and a part in the Lancashire League's Worsley Cup final the following year, Austin retired from first class cricket at the end of the 2003 season.  He returned to the Leagues playing with distinction for St Annes in the Northern Premier League, before returning to his boyhood club, Baxenden and helping them to the Ribblesdale League title, before retiring from all cricket at the end of the 2010 season.

Corralito ([tpl]IPA-es|koraˈlito[/tpl]) was the informal name for the economic measures taken in Argentina at the end of 2001 by Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in order to stop a bank run, and which were fully in force for one year. The corralito almost completely froze bank accounts and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar-denominated accounts.
The Spanish word corralito is the diminutive form of corral, which means "corral, animal pen, enclosure"; the diminutive is used in the sense of "small enclosure" and also "a child's playpen". This expressive name alludes to the restrictions imposed by the measure.

[[Color terminology for race]]
CATEGORIES: Color, Race (human classification), Skin pigmentation, Scientific racism

In some societies and among some anthropologists, color terminology (or colour terminology) was used to label races, sometimes in addition to a non-color term for the same race. Identifying races in terms of their skin color has been common since at least  the Physiognomica falsely attributed to Aristotle.
Other scientists were more cautious about such categorization, and Charles Darwin argued that the number of categories, or in this case the number of different colors, is completely arbitrary and subjective.  For example, some claimed three distinct colors, some four, and others have claimed even more.  In contrast, Darwin argued that there are gradations, or degrees between the numbers of categories claimed, and not distinct categories, or colors."It may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant.", Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man p225, The Mis-portrayal of Darwin as a Racist

A gudgeon is a socket-like, cylindrical (i.e., female) fitting attached to one component to enable a pivoting or hinging connection to a second component.  The second component carries a pintle fitting, the male counterpart to the gudgeon, enabling an interpivoting connection that can be easily separated.  Designs that may use gudgeon and pintle connections include hinges, shutters and small boat rudders.Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, G & C Merriam Company, 1963, p. 370
The gudgeon derives from the Middle English gojoun, which originated from the Middle French goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century.

[[SWiSH Max]]
CATEGORIES: Web development software, 2D animation software

SWiSH Max is a flash creation tool that is commonly used to create interactive and cross-platform movies, animations, and presentations. It is developed and distributed by Swishzone.com Pty Ltd, based in Sydney, Australia. SWiSH Max primarily outputs to the .swf format, which is currently under control of Adobe Systems.[tpl]cite book | last = Baker | first = Donna | title = Official Swishmax Bible | publisher = Wiley & Sons | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7645-7563-5 [/tpl]
SWiSH Max is generally considered to be a simpler and less costly Flash creation tool in comparison with Adobe Flash. SWiSH Max does not support some Adobe Flash features such as ActionScript 3.0, shape tweens, and bitmap drawing capabilities. It does, however, include general Flash creation features such as vector drawing, motion tweens, and symbol editing. In addition, SWiSH Max incorporates a number of automated effects and transitions, which make building certain Flash elements such as buttons, advanced transition effects, and interactive Flash sites simpler. One drawback of SWiSH Max is its inability to open or save .fla files, which limits exchanges between other programs to final .swf files.
The scripting used in SWiSH Max is a variation of ActionScript, commonly known as SWiSH script. SWiSH script contains most ActionScript 2.0 functionality, including support for ActionScript 2.0 classes in SWiSH Max 3.
SWiSH Max was designed for the Windows operating system and can run on a PC with a Pentium III 300 MHz processor, 64MB RAM, and a monitor capable of 1024x768 screen resolution and 16-bit color display.
SWiSH Max3 added features such as a knife drawing tool, advanced shape operations, and ActionScript 2.0 classes.
The latest release of SwiSH Max is SWiSH Max4.

A video was made for "Attitude". The video was directed by Lindy Heymann, and features actor John Hurt performing the song in drag.
"Attitude" peaked at #14 on the UK singles chart,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/suede/|title=Artist Chart History: Suede|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=15 June 2013[/tpl] becoming the group's highest charting single since "She's in Fashion" in 1999.
Some critics viewed the single as an improvement from the group's 2002 album A New Morning, which was considered to be a disappointing album. John Murphy of MusicOMH wrote that "...'Attitude' is one of their best tunes for years." Adding that it's "...the perfect reminder as to why Suede were one of the most intriguing bands of the '90s."Murphy, John. "Track reviews: Suede - Attitude". MusicOMH.

[[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]]

CATEGORIES: Musical groups from New Jersey

Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends was an American country rock band of the early 1970s.
It was founded by D'Andrea (Danny) Bennett and Daegal (Dae) Bennett, both sons of legendary singer Tony Bennett; they comprised the rhythm section.  Other members included Curtis Fried, Gordon Javna, Jon Yaffee, and guitarist/violinist David Mansfield.  The band had a modest local following in northern New Jersey and was the opening act for Gram Parsons at Max's Kansas City in New York.  Their music was oriented towards lighthearted, catchy songs.  The group's name evoked, as People magazine commented, "a line of bathtub toys".http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064236,00.html People Magazine - Quacky Duck—a Hot New Group from the Suburbs
The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records for $75,000 and released the album Media Push in 1974.  The single "The Barnyard Song" received a smattering of airplay on WNEW-FM and the band had a national television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show.  Nevertheless they failed to gain a substantial audience and were dropped by Warner Bros.
The "Media Push" title song from the album boasts what are surely the most politically incorrect lyrics ever released by a major label.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]  The complete obscurity of the Quacky Duck project has relegated this milestone to the cultural shadows.
Mansfield went on to a very successful career with Bob Dylan, The Alpha Band, and as a session musician and composer.  The failure of Quacky Duck helped convince Danny Bennett that his talents lay more in business than in being a musician; as a result he later became Tony Bennett's manager and played a key role in resurrecting his father's commercial career in the 1980s and early 1990s.  Dae Bennett went on to become a recording engineer. Gordon Javna became a  writer and editor and oversees the popular Uncle John's Bathroom Reader series of trivia books. Fried plays bass in the Austin, Texas rock band, Cole Fried Fish.

A cacerolazo ([tpl]IPA-es|kaθeɾoˈlaθo[/tpl]), cacerolada ([tpl]IPA-es|kaθeɾoˈlaða|[/tpl]) or casserole is a form of popular protest practised in certain Spanish-speaking countries – in particular Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Spain – and more recently English and French-speaking countries, most notably Québec, as well as in Turkey during the 2013 protests in Turkey – which consists in a group of people creating noise by banging pots, pans, and other utensils in order to call for attention. What is peculiar about this type of demonstration is that people can protest from their own homes, thus achieving a high level of support and participation.
The word comes from Spanish cacerola, which means "stew pot". The derivative suffixes -azo and -ada denote a hitting (punching or striking) action,Definición de -azo, Diccionario RAE. and has been extended metaphorically to any sort of shock demonstration.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] This type of manifestation started in 1971 in Chile, against the shortages of industrial products during the administration of Salvador Allende.¿Cuándo y porqué nacieron los cacerolazos?

Arnold Frank Hills (12 March 1857 – 7 March 1927) was an English businessman, sportsman, philanthropist, and promoter of vegetarianism.
Hills was the first President of the London Vegetarian Society (1888) and the Vegetarian Cycling and Athletic Club, and also served as President of a London Vegetarian Rambling Club. He also founded The Vegetarian, an independent magazine, as well as the Vegetarian Federal Union (1889), of which he was also President. He also had close ties with the Temperance League. He founded the Oriolet Fruitarian Hospital at Loughton, under the medical direction of Josiah Oldfield.
Arnold Hills was also a keen sportsman who was the English mile and three mile champion, and in his youth had played football and cricket (he was Captain of the 1st XI) for his school team Harrow. After leaving Harrow he attended University College, Oxford, where he earned two football blues. He continued to play as an amateur for Old Harrovians after he left, even winning a Corinthian's Cap whilst there; for England, against Scotland on 5 April 1879 at the Kennington Oval; England won 5-4.
In addition to his vegetarian activism, Hills was Managing Director of the Thames Iron Works, a large shipbuilding business in London which had existed since 1846. He chose to live for five years among his workers in a small house in the East India Dock Road in Canning Town and organised recreational centres for them.
However, he caused some bitterness when there was a strike over poor pay and working conditions by employing 'black' labour. Considering his philanthropy, it must have been a situation that troubled him greatly.
In the summer of 1895 Hills, along with Dave Taylor, helped found Thames Ironworks F.C., who later became West Ham United. He believed that his own local community should have its own football team and financially supported the football club until April 1900, when after increasing disagreements with West Ham's board members over the pursuit of 'professionalism', he broke formal ties with the club and the Thames Ironworks.
Hills proposed a West Ham as a limited company and became the major shareholder, and encouraged  business associates, family and his workman to invest, promising to buy one share for every one sold to the public. He rented the Memorial Grounds to the club at very favourable terms. Hills told the new directors he would not interfere in the running of the club and was true to his word and despite being by far the largest single shareholder never attended an AGM, ask to address a meeting or present any demands or suggestions.
The failing fortunes of the ironworks and his involvement in developing a new car engine pushed the club into the background and he became a virtual invalid suffering from arthritis. He died in 1927 and his shareholding in West Ham of 1100 out of 4000 (1142 shares remained unsold until 1961) passed to his family and the same arrangements remained.West Ham by Charles Korr ISBN 0 7156 2126 2 pages 9, 21

Clocking Off is a British television drama series which ran on the BBC One network for four series from 2000 to 2003. It was produced for the BBC by the independent Red Production Company, and created by Paul Abbott.
It was effectively an anthology programme, following the lives of a group of workers at a Manchester textile factory, with each episode focusing on the home life of a different character. Well-known actors who appeared in the series included Christopher Eccleston, Sophie Okonedo, Philip Glenister, John Simm, Lesley Sharp, Emma Cunniffe, Diane Parish, David Morrissey, Ricky Tomlinson, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Jack P. Shepherd, Tina O'Brien, Jason Merrells, Pam Ferris, Wil Johnson, Ashley Jensen, Susan Cookson, Mark Benton, Sarah Lancashire, Crissy Rock, Marshall Lancaster, Marc Warren and Claire Sweeney.
The series was highly acclaimed by the critics, winning the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2001. However, over the course of the following two years Abbott's work on the series decreased as he moved on to other projects. Nonetheless, every series was nominated for a BAFTA and other writers such as Danny Brocklehurst, John Fay and Jan McVerry wrote successful stand-alone episodes. The programme finally ended, after a series with no Abbott scripts at all, in 2003.
Twenty-seven episodes were produced across the four series, and in 2004 the first series was released on DVD.

[[Normalcy bias]]
CATEGORIES: Cognitive biases, Disaster preparedness, Emergency management

The normalcy bias, or normality bias, refers to a mental state people enter when facing a disaster. It causes people to underestimate both the possibility of a disaster occurring and its possible effects. This may results in situations where people fail to adequately prepare for a disaster, and on a larger scale, the failure of governments to include the populace in its disaster preparations.
The assumption that is made in the case of the normalcy bias is that since a disaster never has occurred then it never will occur. It can result in the inability of people to cope with a disaster once it occurs. People with a normalcy bias have difficulties reacting to something they have not experienced before. People also tend to interpret warnings in the most optimistic way possible, seizing on any ambiguities to infer a less serious situation.
The opposite of normalcy bias would be overreaction, or "worst-case thinking" bias,Bruce Schneier, "Worst-case thinking makes us nuts, not safe", CNN, May 12, 2010 (retrieved April 18, 2014); reprinted in Schneier on Security, May 13, 2010 (retrieved April 18, 2014)Dylan Evans, "Nightmare Scenario: The Fallacy of Worst-Case Thinking", Risk Management, April 2, 2012 (retrieved April 18, 2014);  from Risk Intelligence: How To Live With Uncertainty, by Dylan Evans, Free Press/Simon & Schuster, Inc., 2012; ISBN 9781451610901 in which small deviations from normality are dealt with as if an change in status quo signals an impending catastrophe.

The EAR began developing around the onset of the Miocene, 22-25 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ebinger|first=C.J.|title=Continental break-up: the East African perspective.|journal=Astro. Geophys.|year=2005|volume=46|pages=216–21[/tpl] In the past, it was considered to be part of a larger Great Rift Valley that extended north to Asia Minor.
The rift is a narrow zone that is a developing divergent tectonic plate boundary, in which the African Plate is in the process of splitting into two tectonic plates, called the Somali Plate and the Nubian Plate, at a rate of 6–7 mm annually.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=R.M.S.|last2=Ambrosius |first2=B.A.C.|last3=Noomen|first3=R.|last4=Bastos |first4=L. |last5=Combrinck|first5=L. |last6=Miranda|first6=J.M.|last7=Spakman|first7=W.|title=Angular velocities of Nubia and Somalia from continuous GPS data: implications on present-day relative kinematics.|journal=Earth Planet.

[[Navy bean]]

CATEGORIES: Phaseolus

Navy bean or haricot bean is a variety of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). It is particularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States (where it may also be called pea bean[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=pea+bean|title=Pea bean|publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=2013-09-17[/tpl]).  It features in such dishes as baked beans and even pies, as well as in various soups such as Senate bean soup.Senate Bean Soup. Consumption of baked beans has been shown to lower total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Susan M. Shutler, Gemma M. Bircher, Jacki A. Tredger, Linda M. Morgan, Ann F. Walker and A. G. LOW (1989). The effect of daily baked bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) consumption on the plasma lipid levels of young, normo-cholesterolaemic men. British Journal of Nutrition, 61, pp 257-265 [tpl]doi|10.1079/BJN19890114[/tpl].Donna M. Winham, Andrea M. Hutchins. Baked bean consumption reduces serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic adults.

This might be at least partly explained by high saponin content of navy bean. Saponins also exhibit antibacterial and anti-fungal activity, and have been found to inhibit cancer cell growth.John Shi, Sophia Jun Xue, Ying Mab, Dong Li, Yukio Kakuda, Yubin Lan. Kinetic study of saponins B stability in navy beans under different processing conditions. Journal of Food Engineering 93 (2009) 59–65. Furthermore, navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid among the common bean varieties.Devanand L. Luthria, Marcial A. Pastor-Corrales. Phenolic acids content of fifteen dry edible bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis 19 (2006) 205–211.  It is commonly known as the "Navy Bean" due to its use as a staple of United States Navy rations in the 19th century.
Navy bean varieties include:
Other white beans include cannellini, a variety popular in central and southern Italy, which is related to the kidney bean and, like the kidney bean, has higher levels of the toxic lectin phytohaemagglutinin. White beans are the most abundant plant-based source of phosphatidylserine (PS) yet known.Souci SW, Fachmann E, Kraut H (2008). Food Composition and Nutrition Tables. Medpharm Scientific Publishers Stuttgart.
(The large white beans known in Greece as gígantes (Greek: γίγαντες, giants) and eléfantes (ελέφαντες, elephants) are from the runner bean, Phaseolus coccineus.)

Carter spent her childhood living in a number of locations across Australia, due to her father's position in the Royal Australian Air Force. She studied nursing, and subsequently moved to Darwin in 1979, gaining a position at the hospital there. She studied teaching at the Northern Territory University some years later, and went on to work as an adult educator, teaching in health-related areas in both Darwin and Katherine. Carter later served as Convenor of the Northern Territory Women's Advisory Council to the Chief Minister, Marshall Perron from 1993 to 1995, before going on to work as an investigator for the Health and Community Services Complaints Commission.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22266/20040928-0000/www.clp.org.au/parliamentary%20wing/bios/carter_bio.htm |title=Pandora Archive: Sue Carter MLA, Member for Port Darwin |date=September 2004 |publisher=Country Liberal Party |accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl]
In February 2000, former Chief Minister Shane Stone resigned from parliament, causing a by-election in his safe CLP seat of Port Darwin. Carter won preselection to contest the seat for the CLP, and was easily elected after a quiet campaign where Stone's mandatory sentencing policies were the major issue.[tpl]cite news |title=CLP triumphs |newspaper=Sunday Territorian |date= 12 March 2000[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Territory voters - nowhere to turn? |newspaper=Northern Territory News |date= 20 March 2000[/tpl] She was appointed Deputy Chairman of Committees upon entering parliament, which saw her serve in the Speaker's absence.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/pub/OFFICE%20HOLDERS%201ST-11TH.pdf |title=Office Holders: 1st to 11th Assembly |date=9 February 2009 |publisher=Northern Territory Legislative Assembly |accessdate=5 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=NT - MPs get heated over stolen generation |newspaper=Australian Associated Press |date= 18 May 2000[/tpl] 
Carter was easily re-elected at the 2001 election, despite the decision of CLP stalwart and former territory minister Nick Dondas to contest the seat as an independent. She was promoted to Opposition Whip upon her re-election, and was again promoted in December 2002, when she was appointed Shadow Minister for Health, Senior Territorians, Arts, and Museums. This left her handling the opposition's response in one of the most difficult portfolios in the Northern Territory, with health being a serious and ongoing issue for the territory government.
Carter supported Terry Mills in both his unsuccessful challenge to Opposition Leader Denis Burke in June 2003, and his successful challenge that November. However, in October 2004 she was demoted, with Mills assigning her health portfolio to Jodeen Carney. She was regarded as an outside chance for the CLP leadership when Mills resigned in February 2005, but she allowed Burke to regain the leadership uncontested.
Carter faced re-election again in 2005, and was widely expected to win a third term in office. However, an unexpectedly large victory by the Labor government saw an extremely close result in Port Darwin, with Labor candidate Kerry Sacilotto emerging the victor by 73 votes.
In 2008 Carter returned to her home town of the Gold Coast, after nearly 30 years in the NT,  where she now works as a registered nurse.

Cassiope tetragona (common names include Arctic bell-heather, white arctic mountain heather and Arctic white heather) is a plant native to the high Arctic and northern Norway, where it is found widely.
Growing to 10–20 cm in height, it is a strongly branched dwarf shrub. The leaves are grooved, evergreen, and scale-like in four rows. Pedicels are long and arched. The plant bears bell-shaped, solitary flowers usually with white and pink lobes and pink anthers. The flower stalks and sepals are red, but the petals may also be yellowish-white. The anthers can also be brownish-yellow and flower stalks and sepals yellowish-green.
It grows on ridges and heaths, often in abundance and forming a distinctive and attractive plant community.
In Greenland, Eskimos use the plant as important source of fuel. Because of high resin content, it burns even when wet.John 'Lofty' Wiseman SAS Survival Handbook, Revised Edition p. 72; William Morrow Paperbacks (2008) ISBN 978-1875900060

Ricardo Zamora Martínez ([tpl]IPA-es|riˈkarðo θaˈmoɾa marˈtineθ[/tpl]; 21 January 1901 – 8 September 1978) was a Spanish footballer and manager. He played as a goalkeeper for, among others, RCD Espanyol, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. As an international he played for both the Catalan XI and Spain. As a manager he won two La Liga titles with Atlético Aviación and  briefly managed Spain.
Zamora, nicknamed El Divino, was noted for wearing a cloth cap and a white polo-neck jumper on the field, a look later copied by several of his contemporaries. He claimed it was to protect him from both the sun and his opponents. He was also noted for his bravery. In 1929 while playing for Spain against England, he carried on playing despite breaking his sternum. Spain won the game 4–3, becoming the first team from outside of the British Isles to defeat England. Zamora is also remembered for a spectacular last minute save he made in the 1936 Copa de España final while playing for Real Madrid against FC Barcelona. The award for the best goalkeeper in La Liga, the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, is named in his honour and he was voted one of the greatest players of the 20th century by World Soccer magazine. He was also Spain's most capped player for 45 years until being surpassed by José Ángel Iribar.
Zamora was also the subject of controversy throughout his career. He allegedly enjoyed drinking Cognac and smoking up to three packs of cigarettes a day. During the 1920 Olympic Games he was sent off against Italy after punching an opponent and on the way back from the same tournament he was arrested, imprisoned and fined for attempting to smuggle Havana cigars. In 1922 he was suspended for a year when he lied to the tax authorities about the signing on fee he received when he returned to RCD Espanyol. He also received 40,000 pesetas of the 150,000 peseta fee that took him from Espanyol to Real Madrid. 
Zamora’s apparent political allegiances were also the subject of debate and controversy. Despite playing regularly for the Catalan XI, he was accused of rejecting Catalan nationalism because he spent the majority of his playing career at Espanyol and Real Madrid. In 1934 he was awarded an Order of the Republic medal by his namesake Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, president of the Second Spanish Republic, but during the Spanish Civil War he was exploited by Nationalist propagandists and he played in a benefit game for their cause. During the 1950s he was awarded the Great Cross of the Order of Cisneros by Franco.

The 115th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard was an infantry regiment of the United States Army. It traced its roots back to the American Revolutionary War, although its official U.S. Army lineage begins in 1881. The units to which the 115th Regiment claims lineage served in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, but the 115th itself was only credited with service in World War I, World War II, and the Global War on Terror. Prior to the reorganization into the 58th Brigade Combat Team, the 1–115th was part of the Third Brigade, 29th Infantry Division (Light). In 2006, the 115th was consolidated (merged) with the 175th Infantry Regiment. As a result of this consolidation, it no longer exists as a separate regiment.

[[Lost volume seller]]

CATEGORIES: Contract law, United States law, Uniform Commercial Code

Lost volume seller is a legal term in the law of contracts.  Such a seller is a special case in contract law.  Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).  
In the case of a lost volume seller, the seller goes on to sell the goods to someone else, usually for the same price.  Under the usual measure of damages, such a seller would have no damages (the contract price less the sale price to the other customer is zero) and the breaching buyer would have no liability.
The objective of the law of contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed.  The ordinary measure of damages fails to put the lost volume seller in as good a position as the lost volume seller would have been had the breaching buyer fully performed.  The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale as a result of the first buyer’s breach.  In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the lost profit that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).
Lost volume sellers tend to be those whose capacity to sell or to produce or acquire the subject goods is sufficiently large to meet the demands of all customers who seek to buy those goods.  The term generally arises in the context of a breach of contract action in which the selling party seeks to recover against a breaching buyer who repudiates his or her promise to buy.  For a lost volume seller, the failure to make one sale (i.e., due to the buyer's breach) reduces the seller's profits by the amount of profit that would accrue from that sale.

A frequency grid is a table of all the central frequencies (and corresponding wavelengths) of channels allowed in a communications system.
The most common frequency grid used for fiber-optic communication is that used for channel spacing in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) at wavelengths around 1550 nm and defined by ITU-T G.694.1.ITU-T G.694.1, "Spectral grids for WDM applications: DWDM frequency grid" ITU-T website The grid is defined relative to 193.1 THz and extends from 191.7 THz to 196.1 THz with 100 GHz spacing. While defined in frequency, the grid is often expressed in terms of wavelength, in which case it covers the wavelength range of 1528.77 nm to 1563.86 nm with approximately a 0.8 nm channel spacing.
For practical purposes, the grid has been extended to cover 186 THz to 201 THz and subdivided to provide 50 GHz and 25 GHz spaced grids.

[[Ameloblastoma]]

CATEGORIES: Odontogenic tumors

Ameloblastoma (from the early English word amel, meaning enamel + the Greek word blastos, meaning germ) is a rare, benign tumor of odontogenic epithelium (ameloblasts, or outside portion, of the teeth during development) much more commonly appearing in the lower jaw than the upper jaw.  It was recognized in 1827 by Cusack.  This type of odontogenic neoplasm was designated as an adamantinoma in 1885 by the French physician Louis-Charles Malassez.  It was finally renamed to the modern name ameloblastoma in 1930 by Ivey and Churchill.
While these tumors are rarely malignant or metastatic (that is, they rarely spread to other parts of the body), and progress slowly, the resulting lesions can cause severe abnormalities of the face and jaw. Additionally, because abnormal cell growth easily infiltrates and destroys surrounding bony tissues, wide surgical excision is required to treat this disorder. If an aggressive tumor is left untreated, it can obstruct the nasal and oral airways making it impossible to breathe without oropharyngeal intervention.

The recent closure and conversion of the Silver Lion leaves The Lilley Arms as the village's only pub. The low-lying land to the south of Lilley is called Lilley Bottom.
The village has a football team, although they presently do not play in Lilley due to lack of facilities.  The village cricket club is one of the oldest in Hertfordshire, with fixtures dating back to the mid-1890s.  The cricket club plays at the Geoff Banks-Smith Memorial Cricket Ground, between St Peter's Church and the village hall and are currently in North Herts League Division 2.

[[Sinus Roris]]
CATEGORIES: Maria on the Moon

Sinus Roris (Latin for "Bay of Dew") is an extension of the northern edge of Oceanus Procellarum on the Moon. The IAU-defined selenographic coordinates of this bay are 54.0° N, 56.6° W, and the diameter is 202 km.
The borders of this feature are somewhat indistinct. The bay proper is framed along the western edge by the craters Markov and Oenopides, and to the north by Babbage and South. At the eastern edge it joins the Mare Frigoris.
Many selenographers have taken liberties with the dimensions of Sinus Roris. Lunar maps often indicate a much larger region for this bay than the official dimensions. These can range out as far as the craters Gerard and Repsold to the west, Harpalus to the east, and as far south as 44° N latitude, approaching Mons Rümker.
The area where the official coordinates place this bay has a generally higher albedo than the mare to the south, most likely due to deposits of ejecta from impacts to the north.
Arthur C Clarke's novel A Fall of Moondust is set in a fictional "Sea of Thirst" located within Sinus Roris.

Black Family Channel (founded in 1999 as MBC Network) was a network for African American families and the only wholly black-owned and operated cable television network (BET, as seen below, is owned by Viacom; TV One by Comcast & Radio One; Aspire by Magic Johnson & Intermedia Partners; Bounce TV by Bounce Media LLC; & Revolt by Comcast & Sean "Diddy" Combs). The network's schedule included a variety of programs including religious programs, sports, music, talk shows, and children's programs.
The network was started by noted Florida attorney & philanthropist Willie E. Gary, former all-star baseball player Cecil Fielder, four-time heavyweight boxing champ Evander Holyfield, Marlon Jackson of The Jackson 5, and broadcast television veteran Alvin James through their business venture Major Broadcasting Corporation.[tpl]cite web|last=McGee|first=Sherri|title=Broadcasting the Gospel|url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/mag/broadcasting-the-gospel/|work=Black Enterprise|publisher=BlackEnterprise.com|accessdate=1 November 1999[/tpl]

BFC would effectively be run by actor/director Robert Townsend, who developed original programming for the network, including its most notable effort—the children's educational game show, The Thousand Dollar Bee, in which children would participate in tournament-style rounds of spelling challenges toward which the champion would receive a $1000 bond for his or her college education.
Unlike its primary rival, the Viacom-owned Black Entertainment Television, Black Family Channel avoided rap and hip hop-based programming (they showed gospel music instead).[tpl]cite web|last=Downey|first=Kevin|title=Slow Build for Black Family Channel|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/slow-build-black-family-channel/77198|work=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=BroadcastingCable.com|accessdate=10 February 2006[/tpl]   The network was available in up to 16 million homes in the US.

The Wild Geese is a British 1978 adventure film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen about a group of mercenaries in Africa. It stars Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Richard Harris and Hardy Krüger. The film was the result of a long-held ambition of its producer Euan Lloyd to make an all-star adventure film similar to The Guns of Navarone or Where Eagles Dare.
The film was based on an unpublished novel titled The Thin White Line by Daniel Carney. The film was named The Wild Geese after a 17th-century Irish mercenary army (see Flight of the Wild Geese). Carney's novel was subsequently published by Corgi Books under the same title as the film.
The novel was based upon rumours and speculation following the 1968 landing of a mysterious aeroplane in Rhodesia, which was said to have been loaded with mercenaries and "an African President" believed to have been a dying Moise Tshombe.

Opened on August 18, 1954, with a capacity of 27,000 seats, it is located in the city of Toluca, Mexico, near Mexico City. It is the home of Deportivo Toluca Fútbol Club. Because of its location this stadium has hosted two World Cups (1970 and 1986). One former nuance about this stadium is that it did not have a lighting system which forced the local team, as a tradition to play with sunlight. However, this has changed with Toluca's entry into the Copa Sudamericana because CONMEBOL has a policy stating that all teams participating in the cup must have a lighting system available in their stadiums.

[[Hexton]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Hertfordshire, Hill forts in Hertfordshire, Civil parishes in Hertfordshire

Hexton is a small village and civil parish about six miles (10 km) west of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England.

This parish is a peninsula of Hertfordshire jutting northwards into the county of Bedford. The southern half of the parish is part of the chalky downs of the Chiltern Hills, which are covered with short turf and plantations of fir trees. The hills end abruptly and close to their foot lies the village of Hexton. It stands among grass fields and orchards at the beginning of a low plain, which, sloping gradually to the north, becomes merged in the large plain of southern Bedfordshire. The southern boundary of the parish is the grassy Icknield Way.
Hexton formerly belonged to the half-hundred of Hitchin, but when it came into the possession of the abbots of St. Albans it was probably added by them to their hundred of Cashio. Hexton was originally named Hehstanstuna, Hegestanestone (11th century); Hextenestona (14th century); Hextone (15th century).
Much of the parish was owned by George Hodgson, owner of Hexton Hall, a large modernized house standing in an extensive park. There is no regular village street, but most of the houses are near cross roads, which lead north, south, east and west and connect Hexton with the neighbouring small villages.'Parishes: Hexton', A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2 (1908), pp. 352-354. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43293 Date accessed: 12 June 2013.
Hexton stands in well wooded and hilly country adjacent to the Bedfordshire border. The church, dedicated to St Faith, is mediaeval with heavy 19th-century restoration. The Manor House in its extensive park dates from at least the 15th century, although it was substantially altered in 1901. Far older is the Iron Age camp of Ravensburgh Castle,[tpl]cite web|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1003541 |title=1003541 - The National Hertitage List for England[/tpl] a scheduled ancient monument which straddles a hilltop a mile to the south-west. Limited excavations during the 1960s showed that it was built about 400 BC (See J.Dyer in D.W.Harding Hillforts: Later Prehistoric Earthworks (Academic Press) 1976, p. 153ff. and refortified around 50 BC (see Dyer, ditto).  Rectangular in shape, and enclosing 9 hectares, it is strongly defended by a double rampart and ditch on the north, west and south sides, with a more massive rampart on the vulnerable eastern flank. Of its two entrances, that at the north-west corner belongs to the original build, whilst the south-eastern entrance was added around 50 BC. A gap halfway along the eastern side is modern. It has been suggested that Ravensburgh might have been the headquarters of the Celtic chieftain, Cassivelaunus, attacked in 54 BC.  The excavations showed signs of burning on the eastern rampart. Access to the site is strictly limited. Finds of pottery and a bird-headed weaving comb are in the Stockwood Discovery Centre, Luton.

Wansdyke was a non-metropolitan district within the County of Avon, in the west of England from 1974 to 1996.  
The district was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974 as part of a reform of local authorities throughout England and Wales. Under the reorganisation, the area surrounding the cities of Bath and Bristol was formed into a new county of "Avon", named after the river that ran through the area. The county was divided into six districts, one of which was formed from the areas of Keynsham and Norton-Radstock urban districts along with Bathavon Rural District and part of Clutton Rural District in Somerset. The district was named after the Wansdyke earthwork.
Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the County of Avon and District of Wansdyke were abolished on 1 April 1996. Wansdyke was merged with the neighbouring City of Bath to form the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950493_en_1.htm |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995  |accessdate=12 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |date=1995 [/tpl]

Pasquale Cicogna was the Doge of Venice from 1585 to 1595.  He supported the claim of Henry of Navarre to the French throne, and convinced Pope Sixtus V to support Henry in exchange for his conversion to Catholicism.
He broke with tradition by scattering silver coins, rather than gold ducats, to the crowd during his coronation procession. These coins were known from then on as cicognini.  As his reign of Doge continued his popularity increased because he was very diplomatic and able to tackle major problems with great success.
Arguably, one of his greatest successes was converting the Rialto Bridge, one of Venice's major landmarks and the only bridge over the Grand Canal of Venice, from wood to stone between 1588 and 1591.  Although greater names such as Michelangelo had submitted designs, Pasquale chose the more humble architect Antonio da Ponte and his nephew Antonio Contin to design and rebuild the Rialto Bridge.  After Pasquale Cicogna died of a fever in 1595 a memorial was in scribed on the bridge to the Doge. His dogaressa was Laura Morozini.Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wifes of the doges. London : T. W. Laurie

Katherine is an electoral division of the Legislative Assembly in Australia's Northern Territory. The electorate was first created in 1987 and derives its name from the Katherine River. Katherine encompasses both urban and rural areas, covering an area of 7,428 km² and taking in the city of Katherine, as well as the Tindal RAAF Base and the Binjari Aboriginal Community. There were 5,184 people enrolled in the electorate as of August 2012. 
The city of Katherine has always been a conservative bastion, making the seat of the same name traditionally a very safe Country Liberal Party seat.  Its first member, Mike Reed, was Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1995 to 2001.  Despite this, the seat saw a very large swing to the Australian Labor Party at the 2001 election.   Reed retired in 2003 and was succeeded by Fay Miller, also of the CLP.  Miller narrowly held onto her seat in the ALP's massive victory of 2005, weathering another large swing to the ALP that surprised commentators on election night.  In the end, however, Miller proved to be in the least danger of all the sitting CLP members.She retired in 2008 and was replaced by Willem Westra van Holthe, also of the CLP.

Andrea Gritti (1455 – December 1538) was the Doge of Venice from 1523 to 1538, following a distinguished diplomatic and military career.
Gritti was born in Bardolino, near Verona.  He spent much of his early life in Constantinople as a grain merchant, looking after Venetian interests. In the late 1490s he was using his commercial correspondence for sending encoded information to Venice regarding the movements of the Turkish navy.Labalme P.H. &  Sanguineti White L. (eds.) (2008) Venice, cità excelentissima: selections from the Renaissance diaries of  Marino Sanudo, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,  pp. 232-235. In 1499, he was imprisoned on charges of espionage, but escaped execution due to his friendship with the vizier, and was released several years later. 
In the early sixteenth century, Venice lost nearly all its territory on the Italian mainland, and Gritti played an important part in the events connected with this loss and the eventual return to the status quo ante.
In 1509, after the Venetian defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, Gritti was appointed as proveditor to the Venetian army in Treviso; ordered by the Council of Ten to support revolts against the invaders, he successfully engineered the return of Padua to Venetian hands, and its subsequent defence against the Emperor.  In 1510, following the death of Nicolo di Pitigliano, Gritti took command of Venice's army, but was forced to withdraw to Venice by French advances.  He continued as proveditor through end of the League of Cambrai and the subsequent war of the Holy League.  In 1512, he led the negotiations with Francis I that resulted in Venice leaving the League and allying with France.
Elected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars.  He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary.  However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a new war with the Ottomans. His dogaressa was Benedetta Vendramin.Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wifes of the doges. London : T. W. Laurie He died in 1538.

[[Royal regalia in Nigeria]]
CATEGORIES: Nigerian culture

Nigeria is a federal republic, one composed of a plethora of governorates and kingdoms. Some of the latter had a huge significance in the history of Nigeria before they were subdued by the British during the colonial era. Nevertheless, even today, their principal rulers have been able to maintain their religious, cultural and, to a certain extent, political influence.
The regalia used by these individuals was and is still normally an object or collection of objects of a symbolic significance, such as a coat, robe, mantle, or costume with headgear of same shape or fashion. Other objects included in a comprehensive list of regalia could be small to medium sized statues, such as those found in the Benin Kingdom.
The regalia often had more than merely a political significance. In the southern kingdoms most especially, it was vital for the performance of religious rituals. In this case, the ruler was seen as a link between the world of the living and the spiritual hereafter. Furthermore, in the north, the Muslim emirs and sultans had religious functions as spiritual commanders. The regalia in this case did not have any connotations of a metaphysical nature, but was seen primarily as a symbol of the power of the ruler concerned.
For a list of the Nigerian kingdoms, please refer to the List of Nigerian traditional states.
The regalia today would be kept at the respective capital cities, usually in the palace or palaces of each state.
In April 2005, an exhibition was shown at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, which featured a selection of regalia from 16 states, including Sokoto, Kano, and Borno. The exhibition was organised by the Federal Information Ministry of Nigeria.
A controversy involving some of the crown treasures in question which is currently raging is the celebrated case of the Benin bronzes, sacred items of mostly metallic statuary that were taken by the British colonial powers after their war against the Kingdom of Benin in the 19th century. The bronzes were used for various royal rituals, and were of the highest importance in the traditional religion of the Edo.

The Northern Land Council (NLC) is in the Top End of the Northern Territory of Australia. It has its origins in the struggle of Australian Aboriginal people for rights to fair wages and land. This included the strike and walk off by the Gurindji people at Wave Hill, cattle station in 1966. The head office is located in Darwin. It was established in 1973. 
The NLC Chairman is Samuel Bush-Blanasi.
It is one of four in the Northern Territory, the others are:
The most important responsibility of the councils is to consult traditional landowners and other Aborigines who have an interest in Aboriginal land about land use, land management and access by external tourism, mining and other businesses.  This sometimes involves facilitating group negotiation and consensus-building among scores of traditional Aboriginal landowner groups, and many other affected Aboriginal people. There are 30,000 Aboriginal people from 200 communities. 
Many Aboriginal people in the Northern Land Council's area live in the major towns. There are about 200 communities scattered over Aboriginal land in the NLC's area, ranging in size from small family groups on outstations to settlements of up to 3,000 people.
The Northern Land Council is a representative body with statutory authority under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. It also has responsibilities under the Native Title Act 1993 (so the Native Title Tribunal) and the Pastoral Land Act 1992. The NLC's Top End zone is divided into seven regions with regional offices. 
Today Aboriginal people make up 32.5% of the Northern Territory's population and own some 49% of the land in the Northern Territory.

[[Frustration of purpose]]
CATEGORIES: Contract law, Equitable defenses, Legal doctrines and principles

In the law of contracts, frustration of purpose is a defense to enforcement of the contract. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract, and both parties knew of this principal purpose at the time the contract was made.  Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party (or even nature) can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract.  This concept is also called commercial frustration.
For example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, and, after three years, the house is destroyed, for whatever reason, at no fault of Joe's.  Without a hell or high water clause, Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract (to have a house to live in) has been compromised.  However, he might still have a foreclosure on his credit rating.
Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of impossibility.  The distinction between the two is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, whereas frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract.  For example, suppose entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so she can open a restaurant that only serves Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat.  If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses, or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, then both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.
However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, then Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and that purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.
The Restatement of Contracts, Second § 265 defines frustration of purpose:
A circumstance is not deemed to be a "basic assumption on which the contract is made" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made.  As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully.  Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of Prohibition, when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below normal.
If successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.

An EMD GP15T is a 4-axle diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division between October 1982 and April 1983.  It was a very close cousin to the GP15-1, but used a turbocharger in order to generate more power from a smaller engine. Power was provided by an 8-cylinder diesel engine that generated [tpl]convert|1,500|hp|MW|2|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl], the same as the GP15-1, but with four fewer cylinders. 
28 examples of this locomotive model were built for American railroads. The Chessie System received the majority of them as C&O 1500-1524 (25 units), while the rest went to the Apalachicola Northern in Florida as AN 720-722 (3 units).
Chessie Systems GP15Ts are equipped with dynamic braking and the optional inertial air filtration system, whereas ANs GP15Ts do not have dynamic braking, and also utilize the standard non-inertial intake system.

The genus Anchusa belongs to the tribe Boragineae of the borage family (Boraginaceae). It includes about 40 species.
These species grow in Europe, North Africa, South Africa and Western Asia. They are introduced into the USA.
They consist of annual plants, biennial plants and perennial plants with the general characteristics of the borage family. They are generally herbs, covered with bristly hairs. The leaves are simple or undulate, covered with stiff hairs.
The small radially symmetrical flowers are sapphire blue and retain their colour a long time. The plants show numerous flowers with 5 sepals, united at their bases, and 5 petals forming a narrow tube facing upwards. The flowers grow in several axillary cymes, simple or branched, or are clustered at the end. The flowers are much frequented by bees.
The roots of Anchusa (just like those of Alkanna and Lithospermum) contain anchusin (or alkanet-red ),  a red-brown  resinoid colouring matter. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol, chloroform and ether.
Anchusa species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora onosmella.

This is a small, bowl-shaped feature with a generally circular, sharp-edged rim, although there is a slight elongation at the northern tip. The inner walls are simple slopes that run down to the featureless interior floor. Schönfeld partly overlies an older, crater-like feature of comparable dimensions along its western side.

Paspalum notatum, known commonly as bahiagrass, common bahia, and Pensacola bahia, is a tropical to subtropical perennial grass (family Poaceae). It is known for its prominent V-shaped inflorescence consisting of two spike-like racemes containing multiple tiny spikelets, each about 2.8-3.5 mm long. 
This grass is low-growing and creeping with stolons and stout, scaly rhizomes. The stolons are pressed firmly to the ground and root freely from the internodes, forming a dense sod. The flat, tough-textured leaves are usually hairless, with blades 2–6 mm wide. They are flat, folded, and inrolled, tapering to a fine point. The leaf bases at the terminus of each rhizome usually have a purplish hue. The stems reach 20–75 cm tall. 
The terminal dual racemes are each attached to the top of a slender stem or with one slightly below the other. There is occasionally a third. The spikelets closely overlap in two rows. They are broad, rounded, smooth and shiny. Inside each spikelet is a tiny flower. The tiny, black, featherlike stigmas and black stamens can be seen dangling at the tips of the flowers.  
Bahia grass is native to Mexico and South America, but has been naturalized elsewhere in North America and in other regions. It prefers sandy soils and is tolerant of shade. It is also fairly hardy, tolerating saline conditions and drought.
This grass is used primarily as a forage. The nutritive value remains high when mature, but it is not very productive. It is also valued as an erosion-controlling soil stabilizer, as well as for its productivity, ease of establishment, and persistence. It makes a relatively low-maintenance turf as well, with less disease and insect damage than some of the other warm-season grasses.

[[Eugenio Barsanti]]

Father Eugenio Barsanti (12 October 1821 – 19 April 1864), also named Nicolò, was an Italian engineer, who together with Felice Matteucci of Florence invented the first version of the internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the tile "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses", as documented by the Fondazione Barsanti e Matteucci,http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=u7ijYDkmZxI[tpl]cite web|title=La documentazione essenziale per l'attribuzione della scoperta|url=http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/documentiStorici.html|quote=Another request bears the no. 700 of Volume VII of the Patent Office of the Reign of Piedmont. We do not have the text of this patent request, only a photo of the table which contains a drawing of the engine. This may have been either a new patent or an extension of a patent granted three days earlier, on 30 December 1857, at Turin.[/tpl]
Barsanti was born in Pietrasanta, Tuscany. Lean and short of stature, he studied in a Catholic  scientific-oriented institute near Lucca, in Tuscany, and became a novitiate in Florence in 1838 of the Piarist Fathers or Scolopi, who were known for being open to scientific study.
In 1841 Barsanti began teaching in the Collegio San Michele, situated in Volterra. Here, during a lecture describing the explosion of mixed Hydrogen and air, he realised the potential for using the energy of the expansion of combusting gases within a motor.
Subsequently, when teaching in a college level institute in Florence he met Felice Matteucci, a hydraulic engineer. Matteucci appreciated the idea for the engine, and the two men worked together on it for the rest of their lives.
They patented their invention in London, on 12 June 1854 as Italian law at that time could not guarantee sufficient international protection on the patent. The construction of the prototype was later completed in the 1860s.
The main advantage of the Barsanti-Matteucci engine was the use of the return force of the piston due to the cooling of the gas. Other approaches based on the pushing force of the explosion, like the one developed by France's Etienne Lenoir, were slower. The Barsanti-Matteucci engine was proven to be much more efficient, and won a silver medal from the institute of science of Lombardy.
In 1856 they developed a two-cylinder 5 HP motor and two years later they built a counter-working two-piston engine.
Barsanti thought that the new engine was a great improvement over the steam engine; it was much safer and less cumbersome and quick to operate. It was however not light enough for use as automotive engine. The main target was to provide mechanical energy in factories and for naval propulsion.
After some searching, Barsanti and Matteucci selected the John Cockerill foundry in Seraing, Belgium to mass-produce a four HP engine. Orders for the engine soon followed from many countries within Europe.
Barsanti died suddenly at Seraing of typhoid fever, on 30 March 1864, and Matteucci was left alone to lead the business. The development of the engine failed and Matteucci returned to his first occupation, hydraulics.
When Nikolaus Otto patented his engine, Matteucci unsuccessfully argued that he and his partner Barsanti were the originators.

[[Tennis scoring system]]
CATEGORIES: Tennis, Tennis terminology, Scoring

A tennis tournament (also called a championship) is organized into matches between players (for singles tournaments) or teams of two players (for doubles tournaments). The matches of a tournament are grouped into rounds. In round 1, all players (or teams) are paired and play against each other in matches. The losers are said to leave, or be out. They no longer compete in the tournament (this is single elimination). The winners are again paired to play in the matches of the next round. The tournament continues until the quarterfinal round (having eight players or teams playing in pairs), then the semifinal round (having four players or teams playing in pairs), and finally the final round (having only two players or teams) are played. The winner of the final round is declared the winner of the entire tournament.
A tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets.  A match is won when a player or a doubles team wins the majority of prescribed sets. Traditionally, matches are either a best of three sets or best of five sets format.  The best of five set format is typically only played in the Men's singles matches at Majors and Davis Cup matches.
A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn consist of points, with a tiebreak played if the set is tied at six games per player. Tennis scoring rests on the premise that serving is advantageous over receiving, hence it is only possible to win a set or match by breaking the opponent's service game at least once, before a tiebreak is required. Likewise, it is not possible to win a tiebreak without winning at least one point during an opponent's turn at serve (called a mini-break).

[[The Tale of Melibee]]

CATEGORIES: The Canterbury Tales

The Tale of Melibee (also called The Tale of Melibeus) is one of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Free Study Guide for The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer / The Prologue to the Tale of Melibeus 
This is the second tale told by Chaucer himself as a character within the tales.  It has long been regarded as a joke on the part of Chaucer that, after being interrupted by the host Harry Bailly, Chaucer launches into one of the longest and some would say most boring of all the tales.
The idea that Melibee is simply told by Chaucer to bore the listeners in revenge for having his first story, Sir Thopas, interrupted and compared to a turd ignores Harry's reaction to the tale.  Harry seems to have enjoyed the story and says that he wishes his wife had heard it as she might learn something from Dame Prudence, one of its characters.  It is Harry who originally complains about Sir Thopas for its lewedness meaning boorish or uneducated rather than rude.  He then asks for a tale in prose, something with some doctryne, which is exactly what he received.
The tale is a translation of the Livre de Melibée et de Dame Prudence by Renaud de Louens and this may account for the slightly stilted language when compared to the other tales of Chaucer's own creation.  Renaud's work is in turn a very loose translation of Liber consolationis et consilii by Albertanus of Brescia and this suggests the story was popular at this time.  One final fact which argues against the tale being just a long-winded joke, is that the joke must wear thin very quickly and does not need to be dragged on for over a thousand lines. Many modern English editions of the Tales (such as the Penguin Classics edition translated by Nevill Coghill) omit it entirely, providing a brief plot summary and discussing the religious and philosophical intentions of the story briefly.
The story concerns Melibee who is away one day when three enemies break into his house, beat his wife Dame Prudence, and attack his daughter, leaving her for dead.  The tale then proceeds as a long debate mainly between Melibee and his wife on what actions to take and how to seek redress from his enemies.  His wife, as her name suggests, counsels prudence and chides him for his rash opinions.  The discussion uses many proverbs and quotes from learned authorities and the Bible as each make their points. Summary and Analysis - The Tale of Melibee  Dame Prudence is a woman discussing the role of the wife within marriage in a similar way to the Wife of Bath and the wife in The Shipman's Tale.

The Montgomery and West Point Railroad (M&WP) was an early 19th-century railroad in Alabama and Georgia. It played an important role during the American Civil War as a supply and transportation route for the Confederate Army, and, as such, was the target of a large raid by Union cavalry in the summer of 1864.
The Montgomery Railroad was chartered January 20, 1832, to build track from Montgomery, Alabama, to the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia.  In 1834, it was rechartered with the route going to West Point, Georgia, instead of Columbus.  It wasn't until 1840 when the railroad finally reached Franklin, some [tpl]convert|32.4|mi[/tpl] miles east of Montgomery.Alabama Rail History The Western Railway of Alabama The railroad was sold under foreclosure on July 9, 1842 and was then reorganized as the Montgomery and West Point Railroad on February 13, 1843. The railroad was completed to West Point, GA on April 28, 1851. Three years later the Atlanta and West Point Rail Road was completed connecting Montgomery to east coast markets. The M&WP then built a branch line from Opelika, Alabama to Columbus which began operating in 1856.  
During the Civil War, the railroad was raided in July 1864 by 2,500 Union cavalry troops under the command of Lovell Rousseau. Staged out of Decatur, Rosseau's force managed to take or burn a large number of supplies at Opelika, and destroy 30 miles of track as well as burning railroad stations and warehouses at West Point and Montgomery by July 17.Col. Robert W. BlackCavalry Raids of the Civil War, pp. 178-179. 
After the war, the railroad was repaired and reopened for traffic. The M&WP was merged into the Western Railway of Alabama in 1870.

[[Sir Tommy]]
CATEGORIES: Solitaire card games

Sir Tommy is a solitaire card game using a deck of 52 playing cards. It is said to be the earliest card building games and belongs to the same family of card building games as Calculation and Strategy. It is also known as Try Again, Old Patience and Numerica.
Cards are dealt one at a time. When an ace turns up, it forms a foundation and is built up to King regardless of suit. Four such foundations should be built. A card that cannot yet be placed on the foundation is placed onto one of four wastepiles; once placed, it cannot be moved. The top cards of each wastepile are available to be placed on the foundations.David Parlett (1980) The Penguin Book of Patience ISBN 0-14046-346-1
The game is won if all cards are emptied from the wastepiles and built on the foundations. It is said that for this to be done successfully, one waste pile should be reserved for Kings and other high cards.

[[Mount Olympus (solitaire)]]

CATEGORIES: Solitaire card games

Mount Olympus is a solitaire card game using two decks of 52 playing cards. It is probably thus named because of the tableau's mountain shape and because if won, all the Kings and Queens are displayed, like the Greek gods and goddesses who were said to reside on Mount Olympus.
First, all aces and deuces, or twos (16 cards in all), are removed from the two decks. Then the remaining 88 cards are shuffled and nine of them are laid out on the tableau in an inverted "V" formation. Although this is part of the theme that gives the game its name, the player can opt to just lay the nine cards in a straight line. These nine cards start each of the nine piles in the tableau.
Building on the 16 foundations is up by suit in intervals of two:
Building on the tableau is down, also by suit in intervals of two (i.e. the 5♠ must be placed on the 7♠). A card can be placed on an applicable card, but spaces are not filled. A sequence of cards (such as 6-8-10♣) can be moved as one unit. Any appropriate card can be placed on the foundations at any time.
Once all possible moves have been made or the player has made all moves he wanted to make, a new set of nine cards are dealt, one for each pile. Moving, filling gaps with new cards, and dealing a new set of nine cards continue until the stock has been used up. 
The game is won when all the cards are in the foundations with the Kings and Queens on top.

Elizabeth Hand (born March 29, 1957) is an American writer.
Hand grew up in Yonkers and Pound Ridge, New York. She studied drama and anthropology at The Catholic University of America. Since 1988, Hand has lived in coastal Maine, the setting for many of her stories. She also lives part-time in Camden Town, London which has been the setting for Mortal Love and the short story "Cleopatra Brimstone".
Hand's first story, "Prince of Flowers", was published in 1988 in Twilight Zone magazine, and her first novel, Winterlong, was published in 1990. With Paul Witcover, she created and wrote DC Comics' 1990s cult series Anima.Elizabeth Hand - SCIFIPEDIA Hand's other works are Aestival Tide (1992); Icarus Descending (1993); Waking the Moon (1994), which won the Tiptree Award and the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award; the post-apocalyptic novel Glimmering (1997);  contemporary fantasy Black Light (1999), a New York Times Notable Book; the historical fantasy Mortal Love (2004), a Washington Post Notable Book; and the psychological thriller Generation Loss (2007).  Her story collections are Last Summer at Mars Hill (1998) (which includes the Nebula and World Fantasy award-winning title novella); Bibliomancy (2002), winner of the World Fantasy Award;[tpl]cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention|year= 2010|title=Award Winners and Nominees|url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/|accessdate= 4 Feb 2011[/tpl] and  Saffron and Brimstone: Strange Stories, which includes the Nebula Award-winning "Echo" (2006).

One of Hand's themes from the Winterlong saga is the remorseless exploitation of animal and plant species to create what she calls "geneslaves."  Examples include a three hundred year old genetically reconstructed and cerebrally augmented Basilosaurus by the name of Zalophus; the aardmen, hybrids of dog and man; hydrapithecenes, human-fish or human-cuttlefish hybrids somewhat resembling Davy Jones and his crew from the Pirates of the Caribbean film series; and sagittals, whelks genetically engineered to be worn as a bracelet and, when its host feels threatened or agitated, extrude a spine laced with a deadly neurotoxin.

[[Harold Darke]]

CATEGORIES: 1888 births, 1976 deaths, English composers, English classical organists, People from Highbury, Classical composers of church music

Dr Harold Edwin Darke (29 October 1888 – 28 November 1976) was an English composer and organist.
Darke was born in Highbury, London the youngest son of Samuel Darke & Arundel Bourne and attended Dame Alice Owen's School. While in the RAF he married a violinist, Dora Garland, (the first woman to lead the Queen's Hall Orchestra) at St Michaels, Cornhill on 25 July 1918.
His first organist job was at Emmanuel Church, West Hampstead from 1906 to 1911. He became organist at St Michael's Cornhill in 1916, and stayed there until 1966, leaving only briefly in 1941 to deputise for Boris Ord as Director of Music at King's College, Cambridge during World War II. It is widely accepted that the Cornhill Lunchtime Organ Recitals series begun by Darke in 1916 is the longest-running lunchtime organ concert series in the world; the series has flourished under his successors Richard Popplewell 1966-1979 and the present Organist, Jonathan Rennert, from 1979 to the present. Darke died in Cambridge, aged 88.
His famous setting of Christina Rossetti's In the Bleak Midwinter, giving to his delicate melody a beautiful and lilting organ part, is still often sung at the service of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College, Cambridge, and at similar services around the world. 
In the Bleak Midwinter was voted the greatest Christmas carol of all time in a poll of choral experts and choirmasters that was published on 7 December 2008.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3631068/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter-voted-greatest-carol-of-all-time.html Daily Telegraph article.

Retrieved on 2011-04-14.
Most of his other compositions that are still performed are settings of the Anglican liturgy, especially his three Communion Services in E minor, F, and A minor; and his Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in F.
Darke's work as Conductor of St Michael's Singers was crowned in 1956 on the occasion of the Choir's 40th Anniversary with the first performance of a number of now well-established works composed especially for the occasion - notably "Hierusalem" by George Dyson and "A Vision of Aeroplanes" by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

[[Hilal (crescent moon)]]

CATEGORIES: Arabic words and phrases, Islamic calendar

Hilal ([tpl]lang-ar|هلال[/tpl], [tpl]lang-tr|hilal[/tpl]) is an Arabic term, first developed in pre-Islamic Arabia, meaning crescent moon--specifically, the very slight crescent moon that is first visible after a new moon.  Muslims look for the hilal when determining the beginning and end of Islamic months, but do not worship it. The need to determine the precise time of the appearance of the hilal was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy.Hilal - Oxford Islamic Studies Online
The Quran says: "And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him." (Fussilat:37). In another verse, “They ask you, Muhammad, about the new moons. Say, ‘They are measurements of time for the people and for Hajj.’” (al-Baqarah:189)
The hilal came to be used as a powerful symbol of Muslim states early on in Islamic history.

Mandel'shtam is the remains of a large crater on the Moon's far side. Nearly attached to the northeast outer rim is the crater Papaleksi. To the south lies the crater Vening Meinesz.
The outer rim of this crater has been battered into near ruin, with sections forming only an irregular circular rise in the surface. Much of the rim consists of clefts, small craters, and ridges. The satellite crater Mandel'shtam R breaks across the rim to the west-southwest, and Mandel'shtam Y is attached to the northern edge.
The interior floor of the crater has not escaped bombardment, and the central portion is overlain by Mandel'shtam A, a respectable crater in its own right. Mandel'shtam N lies on the interior along the south-southwestern inner edge. The northwestern floor and to a lesser degree the southeast floor are relatively level, and have suffered less impact damage than elsewhere.
A small crater to the east has a small ray system with several faint, streaky rays overlaying the floor of Mandel'shtam.

Adaptive control is the control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain.  For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption;  a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions.  Adaptive control is different from robust control in that it does not need a priori information about the bounds on these uncertain or time-varying parameters; robust control guarantees that if the changes are within given bounds the control law need not be changed, while adaptive control is concerned with control law changing themselves.

[[Apple's transition to Intel processors]]

CATEGORIES: Macintosh platform, Intel Corporation

Apple's Intel transition was the process of changing the CPU of Macintosh computers from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors. The transition became public knowledge at the 2005 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), when Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs made the announcement that the company would make a transition from the use of PowerPC microprocessors supplied by Freescale (formerly Motorola) and IBM in its Macintosh computers, to processors designed and manufactured by Intel, a chief supplier for most of Apple's competitors.Apple press release, June 6, 2005:Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006
The transition marked the Macintosh platform's second migration to a new CPU architecture. The first was the switch from the Motorola 68k architecture (used since the original Macintosh 128k) to the PowerPC architecture. Apple is the only personal computer company to have successfully completed such a transition – competitors Commodore and Atari never regained their market positions after their switch from 6502 to 68k in the mid-1980s[ref][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,933453,00.asp|title=Apple Switch, By John C.

[[Crazy Quilt (solitaire)]]

CATEGORIES: Solitaire card games

Crazy Quilt (also known as Indian Carpet and Japanese Rug) is a solitaire card game using two decks of 52 playing cards each. The game is so-called because the reserve resembles the weaves of a carpet or an arrangement of a quilt. The arrangement of the cards on the reserve is also the reason it is rarely seen on computer solitaire packages, most of which have their cards placed vertically.
First, one Ace and one King of each suit are taken out to form the foundations. The rest of the cards are shuffled, and 64 cards are dealt into eight rows of eight cards each. The first row should have its first card placed vertically, the second placed horizontally, the third vertically, the fourth horizontally, and so on. The second row should have its first card placed horizontally, its second one vertically and so on. To make this description short, the resulting layout should resemble a chessboard; the cards placed on one direction (vertically or horizontally) represent the darker squares and the cards placed on the other direction symbolize the lighter squares. This reserve is called the "quilt."
The cards on the quilt with their shorter sides exposed, i.e. cards each with one of its shorter sides not touching another card, are available for play to the foundations or the top of the wastepile. The foundations that start with the Aces are built up by suit while those that start with the Kings are built down also by suit.
The stock is dealt one at a time onto the wastepile. The top card of the wastepile can be used to build on the foundations and be built up or down by suit using cards from the quilt. 
Once the stock runs out, the wastepile (which includes cards acquired from the quilt) is gathered and turned faced down without shuffling to be used as the new stock. This can be done only once in the entire game.
The game is won when all cards, both from the quilt and the wastepile, end up in the foundations.

[[New Brunswick electoral redistribution, 2006]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of New Brunswick, Electoral redistributions in Canada, New Brunswick Legislature, 2006 in politics, 2006 in Canada, 21st century in New Brunswick

The New Brunswick electoral redistribution of 2006 was undertaken as a result of legislation introduced by Bernard Lord, the Premier of New Brunswick, Canada, on June 9, 2005.  The legislation establishes a statutory requirement for redistribution of electoral districts after every decennial Canadian census.
The redistribution process set out in the legislation took approximately six months to complete, and was overseen by an independent commission.  The bill introduced by the government would have required that 55 ridings be maintained with populations varying between 75% and 110% of 1/55 of the provincial population.  The Opposition Liberals expressed a desire for the commission to have greater flexibility either in the variance of the average population or in the number of districts. On June 30, 2005, an agreement was reached and the bill was amended to allow the commission to ignore population basis entirely in "extraordinary circumstances," but should strive to be within the range of 90% to 110% of the average population of 55 districts.
There was considerable work to be done as 35 out of the 55 districts that existed from the outset were outside of the +/- 10% range.  This is due in part to the population shifts over the course of a decade, and  because the requirement was +/- 25% during the previous redistribution.
In the end, the commission was able to maintain most districts in their same alignment by means of minor boundary adjustments.  However, two sets of districts were merged and there were considerable changes of district boundaries in the cities Dieppe and Fredericton.

Hosokawa Takakuni ([tpl]lang|ja|細川 高国[/tpl], 1484 – 17 July 1531) was the most powerful military commander in the Muromachi period under Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the twelfth shogun. His father was Hosokawa Masaharu, who was the branch of the Hosokawa clan.[tpl]cite book|title=The Culture of Civil War in Kyoto|author= Mary Elizabeth Berry|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20877-3|page=141[/tpl][ref]

In 1507, Hosokawa Masamoto was killed by his foster son, Hosokawa Sumiyuki who had been disinherited by Masamoto. Takakuni supported Hosokawa Sumimoto and got credit for putting down Sumiyuki. Because of that, he participated in the Muromachi shogunate in depth.  In 1508, when Ōuchi Yoshioki marched his armies into Kyoto with Ashikaga Yoshiki (Ashikaga Yoshitane), the former shogun who had escaped to Suo Province, Takakuni conspired with them and purged the shogun Ashikaga Yoshizumi and Sumimoto to Ōmi Province. 
Takakuni and Yoshioki took hold of the Muromachi shogunate. Takakuni took over as head of the Hosokawa people and took the blam of Kanrei. In addition, he also held the post of Shugo of Settsu Province, Tamba Province, Sanuki Province and Tosa Province. In 1518, he monopolized the powers of the shogunate after Yoshioki went back to his domain. In 1521, Yoshiki hated to be a puppet shogun, and escaped to Awa Province. Takakuni made Ashikaga Yoshiharu, son of Yoshizumi, take up the post of shogun.
Takakuni took Yanagimoto Kataharu, the younger brother of Kanishi Motomori, chief vassal of the Hosokawa people, as his wakashu and the two swore eternal love to each other. Kataharu, even after reaching adulthood, remained a favorite vassal. However, as a result of a calumny by his own cousin, Takakuni felt obliged to have Motomori killed. Though initially appeased by his lord, Yanagimoto shortly after joined with another brother against the cousin to avenge Motomori's death.Watanabe, Tsuneo and Jun'ichi Iwata.  The Love of the Samurai: A Thousand Years of Japanese Homosexuality. p. 51.
In 1527, he was purged from Kyoto by Miyoshi Motonaga and Hosokawa Harumoto.  In 1531, his army was defeated, and he hid in a store room for alcoholic beverage at Amagasaki, Settsu Province.  When he was detected, he committed suicide.

Purohit in the Indian religious context means a  family priest, from Puras meaning front, and hita, placed. The word is also used synonymously with the word pandit that also means a priest. Tirth Purohit means the Purohits which site on ford of the holy rivers or holy tanks, which maintained the records of the forefathers of the Hindu family from thousands years back. 
Rajpurohit was an ancient term used to denote a priest who acted for royalty, carrying out rituals and providing advice. In this sense, it is synonymous with Rajguru. Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund note that "There is much evidence in ancient texts that there were two ideal types of Brahmins in those days, the royal priest or advisor (rajpurohit, rajguru) and the sage (rishi) who lived in the forest and shared his wisdom only with those who asked for it."[tpl]cite book |title=A History of India |first1=Hermann |last1=Kulke |authorlink1=Hermann Kulke |first2=Dietmar |last2=Rothermund |authorlink2=Dietmar Rothermund |edition=Fourth |publisher=Routledge |origyear=1986 |year=2004 |page=5 |isbn=9780415329194 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C |accessdate=25 December 2012[/tpl] Its modern use in this sense has been described by Sumit Sarkar as a "self-conscious archaism".[tpl]cite book |title=Beyond Nationalist Frames: Postmodernism, Hindutva, History |first=Sumit |last=Sarkar |authorlink=Sumit Sarkar |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2002 |isbn=9780253342034 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XaDVarGyzZsC |page=73 |accessdate=25 December 2012[/tpl]

The album is considered to be a critical success (explicitly not aimed toward a mainstream market), and gained publicity by featuring the surprise mainstream hit "Pop Goes the Weasel," a diss track towards Vanilla Ice. The music video features former Black Flag frontman Henry Rollins as Ice. X-Clan is dissed on songs such as "Herbalz In Your Mouth."
The album is noted for its variety of styles (both musically and lyrically), and demonstrates influences ranging from De La Soul to A Tribe Called Quest (both members of the then-flourishing Native Tongues Movement).

[[Adamant, Vermont]]
CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Vermont, Unincorporated communities in Washington County, Vermont

Adamant is a small, unincorporated community in Washington County, Vermont, United States, in the central part of the state.
The village is situated on the town line between Calais to the north and East Montpelier to the south.  There is no true boundary to define the village, and as such there is great debate as to what constitutes residence.  This is, however, purely theoretical as there is no legal, governmental or commercial status associated with residence.  The debate has given rise to the common aphorism that, "Adamant is a state of mind".
The village was originally known as Sodom from its inception in the mid-19th century as a granite quarry-town until 1905 when residents petitioned the state legislature for a name change.  The quarries remained an active part of the Vermont granite industry well into the mid-20th century.
The village center is the Adamant Co-op, a general store and post office located at the junction of Haggett, Quarry, Center and Sodom Pond Roads.  Founded in 1935, it is the state's oldest co-operative.
Perhaps the Village's most notable inclusion is the Adamant Music School, a summer-long piano and musicology school founded in 1942.

The Winter Hill Gang is a structured confederation of Boston, Massachusetts-area organized crime figures, predominantly Irish-American and Italian-American.  It derives its name from the Winter Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts north of Boston. Its members have included notorious Boston gangsters Howie Winter, James "Buddy" McLean, James J. "Whitey" Bulger, and hitmen John Martorano and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi. They were most influential from 1965 under the rule of McLean and Winter until the takeover led by Bulger in 1979. 
The Winter Hill Gang was given its name in the 1970s by journalists at The Boston Herald, although the name was hardly ever openly used as a reference to them. While Winter Hill Gang members are alleged to have been involved with most typical organized-crime-related activities, they are perhaps most known for fixing horse races in the northeastern United States.[tpl]cite web|last=Finley|first=Bill|title=The reverend's deal with the devil; Eddie Donnally crossed Boston mobsters and lived to tell about it|url=http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/9481509/the-jockey-crossed-whitey-bulger|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]  Twenty-one members and associates, including Winter, were indicted by federal prosecutors in 1979.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/whitey/globe_stories/1998/whitey_and_the_fbi_part_4_sidebar_b.htm |title=/ The search for 'Whitey' Bulger |publisher=Boston.com |date=1998-07-22 |accessdate=2012-04-17[/tpl]

In computing, a file shortcut is a handle in a user interface that allows the user to find a file or resource located in a different directory or folder from the place where the shortcut is located. 
Shortcuts are typically implemented as a small file containing a target URI or GUID to an object, or the name of a target program file that the shortcut represents. The shortcut might additionally specify parameters to be passed to the target program when it is run. Each shortcut can have its own icon. Shortcuts are very commonly placed on a desktop, in an application launcher panel such as the  Microsoft Windows Start menu, or in the main menu of a desktop environment. The functional equivalent in the Macintosh operating system is called an alias, and a symbolic link (or symlink) in UNIX-like systems.

Because he aspired to nobility he modified the details of his early life.  Though he was born in Perugia he claimed to have been born in Rome.  His family name was Buonamici, but Agostino adopted the surname Tassi to give substance to his story that he was adopted by the Marchese Tassi. He was actually the son of a furrier named Domenico.

[[Lord High Admiral of Scotland]]

CATEGORIES: Lord High Admirals of Scotland, Lists of Scottish military personnel, Royal Scottish Navy

The Lord High Admiral of Scotland was one of the Great Offices of State of the Kingdom of Scotland before the Union with England in 1707.
The office was one of considerable power, also known as Royal Scottish Admiralty, including command of the King's ships and sailors (see Royal Scottish Navy) and inspection of all sea ports, harbours, and sea coasts. The Admiral appointed judges to decide causes relating to maritime affairs, including both civil and criminal jurisdiction, and juridsiction over creeks, fresh and navigable waterways. The duties were exercised through Vice-Admirals and Admirals-Depute, later called Judge Admirals. 
Apart from occasional earlier references,[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2009[/tpl] the office seems to have originated in the early 15th century and was held by once held by Sir Robert Logan of Grugar, later also of Restalrig and the Earls of Bothwell and the Dukes of Lennox. It was one of the heritable offices that Charles II gave to his illegitimate son Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox. 
The earliest surviving records of the Scottish High Court of Admiralty date from 1557, convened under the authority of the Earl of Bothwell, in Edinburgh or Leith. Although all maritime causes in Scotland below a river's first bridge were in its view, it was inferior to the Court of Session, and its authority was contested by the Court of Justiciary in criminal matters. The Court was formally to be held, fenced, within the sea-flood and wherever it was actually held the Admiral would declare that to be the case. The judges were Bothwell's two vice-admirals, men otherwise unknown who were almost certainly professional lawyers rather than mariners.Thomas Callander Wade ed., Acta Curiae Admirallatus Scotiae, 1557-1562, Stair Society, (1937), xiii-xxiii.
By the Act of Union 1707 all admiralty jurisdictions were placed under the Lord High Admiral of Great Britain or Commissioners of the Admiralty.Article 19, Act of Union 1707  Nevertheless the Vice-Admiral of Scotland who received his commission from the Crown continued to appoint the Judge Admiral (until 1782) and Admirals-depute and to rank as an Officer of the Crown.
The Public Offices (Scotland) Act 1817 provided that no person thereafter appointed as Vice Admiral should receive a salary.[tpl]citation |title=Section 10, Public Offices (Scotland) Act 1817 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1817/64/ukpga/c64/10 |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom| volume=64| page=10| date=7 July 1817| quote=No person henceforth to be appointed to either of the offices of knight marshal or vice-admiral in Scotland shall enjoy or receive any salary whatever for or in respect of either of the said offices.[/tpl] The Admiralty Court in Edinburgh was abolished in 1830 and the Court of Session granted subject-matter jurisdiction.[tpl]citation | title=Section 21, Court of Session Act 1830 |periodical=Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/documents/1830/69/ukpga/c69/21 | date=23 June 1830 |volume=69 |page=21 | quote=the Court of Session shall hold and exercise original jurisdiction in all maritime civil causes and proceedings of the same nature and extent in all respects as that held and exercised in regard to such causes by the High Court of Admiralty before the passing of this Act | accessdate=31 August 2009[/tpl]

Terence Michael Alderman (born 12 June 1956, in Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia) is a former Australian cricketer who played primarily as a right-arm fast-medium bowler of limited pace but nagging accuracy and movement.
He began his first-class career in 1974 with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and came to international prominence when he was chosen for the Australian national team to tour England in 1981. In that series he took 42 Test wickets, including nine on debut,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63289.html |title=1st Test: England v Australia at Nottingham, Jun 18-21, 1981 |accessdate=2011-12-13|work=espncricinfo[/tpl] the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match.[tpl]cite book|last=Walmsley|first=Keith|title=Mosts Without in Test Cricket|year=2003|publisher=Keith Walmsley Publishing Pty Ltd|location=Reading, England |isbn=0947540067|pages=457[/tpl] He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition.
He was disabled from playing for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth.
Alderman took part in an  unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from Test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England. 
Following his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final Test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 Test wickets.
He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent (1984 and 1986) and then with Gloucestershire (1988). He now works as a radio commentator in Australia.
On 28 July 2000, Alderman was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for being the all-time leading wicket taker for Western Australia.[tpl]cite web|title=Terry Alderman|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=984216&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=31 December 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Lace, Textile arts of England

Hollie Point is an English  needle lace noted for its use in baby clothes in the 18th and 19th century.
It is found in English needleworks such as samplers, stump-work embroideries and tape laces from second half of 17th century, its use in the form known as hollie point dates from early 18th century.
Hollie Point is a flat needlepoint lace with rows of knotted buttonhole stitches worked over stretched threads. Simple designs are created by holes left in otherwise plain cloth work formed by the buttonhole stitches. Noted for its appearance in baby clothes in the 18th and early 19th century, particularly in caps, the shoulder seams of shirts, bibs and detachable sleeves worn over babies swaddling bands.
Early 18th century bonnets tend to be plain but the second half of the century saw the introduction of a band of lace extending from centre front of bonnet to the nape of the neck, sometimes with a circle in the back.  This band was later accompanied by parallel line of pulled-thread embroidery while in early 19th century the circular cap back reappeared. 
Items decorated with hollie point were often made for christenings, it is probable that this type of work was done by ladies of a household or the nanny

[[Chronicon Scotorum]]
CATEGORIES: Irish chronicles, 12th-century history books, Texts of medieval Ireland, Irish manuscripts, Irish books

Chronicon Scotorum is a medieval Irish chronicle.
According to Nollaig Ó Muraíle,  it is "a collection of annals belonging to the 'Clonmacnoise group', covering the period from prehistoric times to 1150 but with some gaps, closely related to the 'Annals of Tigernach'. It survives in a paper copy made by Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh c.1640 from an exemplar no longer extant."
MacFhirbhisigh's copy was held by his friend (and possible pupil) Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh in the late 17th century, but was in France for a time in the 1760s before its purchase by Trinity College Dublin in 1776. Edited and published by William M. Hennessy in 1866, it is accorded to be one of the more valuable Irish annals by virtue of its computistical data which were frequently distorted in other such compilations.
Gilla Críst Ua Máel Eóin has been associated with the text as its compiler,Stokes, George Thomas: Ireland and the Anglo-Norman Church.  A History of Ireland and Irish Christianity from the Anglo-Norman Conquest to the Dawn of the Protestant Reformation (1889), p 360: "...The Chronicon Scotorum was originally compiled about the year 1150 by Christian Malone, Abbot of Clonmacnis,..." but if so, it was continued at some point after his death. His actual role in relation to the Chronicon is uncertain.

[[Suicide pact]]

CATEGORIES: Suicide types, Collaboration, Joint suicides

A suicide pact is an agreed plan between two or more individuals to commit suicide. The plan may be to die together, or separately and closely timed. Suicide pacts are important concepts in the study of suicide, and have occurred throughout history, as well as in fiction.
Suicide pacts are generally distinct from mass suicide. The latter refers to incidents in which a larger number of people kill themselves together for the same ideological reason, often within a religious, political, military or paramilitary context. Suicide pacts, on the other hand, usually involve small groups of people (such as married or romantic partners, family members, or friends) whose motivations are typically non-ideological.
A suicide pact negotiated over the internet, often between complete strangers, is an internet suicide.
In England and Wales, suicide pact is a partial defence, under section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957, which reduces murder to manslaughter. In Northern Ireland, this defence is created by section 14 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 (c. 20) (N.I.).

Sid the Slug is an advertising character employed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in the United Kingdom as the face of the "Salt - Watch it" campaign to warn the public of the risks of excessive salt consumption. 
The multimedia campaign, including advertising hoardings, television commercials and Internet coverage, was based on the premise that salt kills slugs, and can harm humans too. The campaign infuriated the Salt Manufacturers' Association (SMA), who complained to the Advertising Standards AuthoritySalt Manufacturers' Association press release ‘Squash Slug’ Says Salt Industry 20 September 2004 - their complaint being that the information presented was misleading. The Advertising Standards Authority did not uphold the SMA complaint in its adjudication.Broadcast Advertising Adjudications: 20 April 2005 (PDF)
The ASA had to deal with another complaint from a member of the public, that the use of the name "Sid" was offensive; this was also rejected, with the ASA instead arguing that most people would find it "humorous".BBC Salt advert complaint rejected 12 October 2004
A member of the public complained to the FSA that the Welsh subtitles in the ‘Sid the Slug’ TV advertisements meant the FSA was not treating English and Welsh equally, as is required by the FSA Welsh Language Scheme. The FSA replied that the animation could not have been dubbed into Welsh successfully, hence the subtitles. However, the FSA accepted that it had not complied with advertising conduct, as set by the Welsh Language Board.Food Standards Agency Complaints Received by the FSA in 2004 - 2005

The Corcadorca Theatre Company was founded in Cork in 1991 and is one of Ireland's leading independent theatre companies.
The company strives to be integral part of the cultural life of the city, and has sought to develop new writing through its biennial Corcadorca Playwright Award, and by commissioning new work from more established writers (Disco Pigs by Enda Walsh, and Bruen's Twist by Eamonn Sweeney).
The company has also served as a base for some renowned acting talent, including Cillian Murphy (Disco Pigs, Batman Begins, Girl with a Pearl Earring).
The name of the company is from the Irish Corca Dhorcha, or "dark" Corca, a play on words of Corca Dhuibhne, the Dingle Peninsula, portrayed (jokingly) as a backward area of country bumpkins. The Irish word dorcha (meaning "dark"), also has the extended meanings such as "ignorant," "unlettered," or "uneducated," and is the origin of the English slang word dork.

Aldicarb is a carbamate insecticide which is the active substance in the pesticide Temik.  It is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus, fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide. Aldicarb is a cholinesterase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure.
Aldicarb is effective where resistance to organophosphate insecticides has developed, and is extremely important in potato production, where it is used for the control of soil-borne nematodes and some foliar pests. Its weakness is its high level of solubility, which restricts its use in certain areas where the water table is close to the surface.

The Firebrat (Thermobia domestica, sometimes listed as Thermophila furnorum) is a small insect (typically 1–1.5 cm) similar to the Silverfish, both in the order Thysanura.
Firebrats prefer higher temperatures and require some humidity, and can be found in bakeries and near boilers or furnaces. They feed on a wide variety of carbohydrates and starches that are also protein sources such as dog food, flour and book bindings. They are distributed throughout most parts of the world and are normally found outdoors under rocks, leaf litter, and in similar environments, but are also often found indoors where they are considered pests. They do not cause major damage, but they can contaminate food, damage paper goods, and stain clothing. Otherwise they are mostly harmless.
At [tpl]frac|1|1|2[/tpl] to [tpl]frac|4|1|2[/tpl] months of age the female firebrat begins laying eggs if the temperature is right (32–41 °C or 90–106 °F).  It may lay up to 10,000,000 eggs in a lifetime of about 3-5 years. After incubation (12–13 days), the nymphs hatch. They may reach maturity in as little as 2-4 months, resulting in several generations each year.

William Kent (March 29, 1864 – March 13, 1928) was an American who served as a United States Congressman representing the State of California.  He spearheaded the movement to create the Muir Woods National Monument by donating land to the Federal Government for the Monument.
Kent was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents moved the family to Marin County in California in the year 1871.  He graduated from Yale University in 1887, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.[tpl]cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1927-28.pdf | title=Obituary Record of Yale Graduates 1927-1928 | accessdate=March 26, 2011 | date=15 September 1928 | publisher=Yale University[/tpl][tpl]rp|107[/tpl]
Upon graduation, Kent returned to Chicago and entered the real estate and livestock businesses.  He also became involved in politics, becoming a member of the city council and president of the Municipal Voter's League of Chicago.
In 1907, Kent returned to California and entered the national stage of politics by earning election as a Progressive Republican to the 62nd United States Congress.  For the 63rd and 64th Congresses he was reelected as an Independent. In total, he served in Congress from March 4, 1911 to March 4, 1917.
In 1916, Kent was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House of Representatives that created the National Park Service.  The similar Senate bill was sponsored by Reed Smoot.  The legislation passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916, passed the Senate on August 5, and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.[ref]
</ref>
Kent was also heavily involved in local politics; he was one of the major supporters of the creation of the Marin Municipal Water District in 1911, and also backed early efforts for a Golden Gate Bridge.  While Kent supported conservation, he also actively worked to promote growth and development in Marin, such as his support for the Mt. Tamalpais & Muir Woods Railway, a renowned Marin County attraction partially funded by his father, A.E. Kent.  His wealth as one of the major landowners in the county increased greatly as property values rose.
Following his career in Congress, Kent was appointed to the United States Tariff Commission (now known as the United States International Trade Commission). He served on the Commission from March 21, 1917 to March 31, 1920.
Kent was also a philanthropist.  Together with his wife, Elizabeth Thacher Kent, he purchased 611 acres (2.5 km²) of one the last remaining stands of coast redwoods along Redwood Creek north of  San Francisco Bay.  To protect the redwood grove from development, he donated 295 acres (1.19 km²) to the Federal Government.  President Theodore Roosevelt declared the area a national monument in 1908 and suggested naming the monument after Kent.  Kent demurred and suggested the grove be named Muir Woods National Monument, after naturalist John Muir.  Portraits of the Kent family by artist Herbert A. Collins hang there.
He was the father of Sherman Kent and Roger Kent and the brother-in-law of Sherman Day Thacher. His wife was the daughter of Yale professor and administrator Thomas Anthony Thacher
Kent died in Kentfield, California.  His remains were cremated in Oakland, California.

The Sham Mirrors is the third studio album by Norwegian avant-garde metal band Arcturus. It was released on April 9, 2002.
The Sham Mirrors is a departure from the band's previous albums; it features a much more modern, "outer space"-influenced sound, as opposed to the classical music-inspired layered melodies of 1997's La Masquerade Infernale, and contains elements of trip-hop, ambient music and electronica in addition to the band's typical heavy and black metal sound. Lyrically, the album deals with abstract science fiction-themed subjects, a departure from the Satanic lyrics of earlier work. The album cover depicts a model drawing of the upper part of the Apollo spaceship.

Eleni or Helena (died April, 1522) was the wife of Zara Yaqob, and Empress of Ethiopia. She played a significant role in the government of Ethiopia during her lifetime, acting as regent or advisor to a number of emperors; one testimony of this is the manuscript Bruce 88, which states that she had been in the palace of three illustrious Emperors: Zara Yaqob; his son by another wife, Baeda Maryam I, and Na'od.Beckingham and Huntingford, translators, The Prester John of the Indies by Francisco Alvarez (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961), p. 14 n.3
The daughter of Mehmad king of Hadiya, she converted to Christianity upon marrying Zara Yaqob. Although the Portuguese historian Baltazar Téllez wrote that she had no children, in some manuscripts of Francisco Álvares's The Prester John of the Indies, a male relative of Lebna Dengel who escaped from Amba Geshen is described as her son, according to the translator but not the original textFrancisco Alvarez,  Prester John, p. 245
With his own mother Tsion Mogasa dead, Emperor Baeda Maryam I gave Eleni the title of Queen Mother. She proved to be an effective member of the royal family; Paul B. Henze comments that she "was practically co-monarch" during his reign.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 75 When Eskender succeeded his father Emperor Baeda Maryam I, at first Empress Eleni was pushed out of power by the Bitwoded Amda Mikael. However, around 1486 she participated in a palace coup that led to his deposition and execution, and Queen Eleni thereafter played a leading role in the Emperor's government, which continued into the reign of Emperor Na'od.
Alvarez was told by the Abuna Marqos, that upon Emperor Na'od's death in combat "he and Queen Eleni made him Dengel King, because they had all of the great men in their hands"Alvarez, Prester John, p. 243 This statement points to the power Eleni wielded. Likewise Eleni, understanding the increasing threat that Ethiopia faced from the growing Ottoman influence in the region, with the counsel of Pero da Covilhã sent Mateus (also known as Matthew the Armenian) as an ambassador to the King of Portugal and the Pope in Rome, a fact that the Portuguese only understood after they arrived in Ethiopia, and which complicated Dom Rodrigo da Lima's mission to the Ethiopian Emperor.Beckingham and Huntingford, translators, Prester John, p.307; paraphrasing the account of Gaspar Correa.  Apparently Alvarez never learned this, for in his narrative he repeats without explanation Lebna Dengel's claim that Mattheus lacked the authority to represent him (e.g., p. 283).  Eleni served as chief regent for the under-age Lebna Dengel, along with his mother, the Dowager Empress Na'od Mogassa, and Ras Degelhan of Gojjam, the Emperor's senior male relative.
Alvarez also notes that Elena possessed extensive estates in the province of Gojjam.Alvarez, Prester John, pp. 425, 458. Others said that "she was accomplished in everything: in front of God by practising righteousness and having strong faith, by praying and receiving Holy Communion; in worldly terms, she was accomplished in preparing food the royal table, in familiarity with the books, in knowledge of the law, and in understanding the affairs of state. For these qualities, the King greatly loved our Queen
Eléni. He considered her like his own mother’.Jules Perruchon 1893, Les chroniques de Zar’a Yâ‘eqôb et de Ba’eda Mâryâm. Paris: Bouillon, 175-6, as cited in Rita Pankhurst, "Taytu’s Foremothers: Queen Eleni, Queen Säblä Wängel and Bati Dəl Wämbära," Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, edited by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, 53. Trondheim, Norway: Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 2009.
The date of Eleni's death is not entirely certain; Henze states that she died at an advanced age in the 1520s,Henze, Layers, p. 86 n.8 but Beckingham and Huntingford argue that the evidence in Alvarez's account provides enough information to date her death to April, 1522.Beckingham and Huntingford discuss the evidence on p. 425 n.1 of their translation. Despite the uncertainty, Alvarez makes it clear that she died while he was in Ethiopia, adding that her death was a cause for sorrow by her subjects:

[[Marshall–Lerner condition]]

CATEGORIES: International trade, International economics

The Marshall–Lerner condition (after Alfred Marshall and Abba P. Lerner) has been cited as a technical reason why a reduction in value of a nation's currency need not immediately improve its balance of trade.[tpl]Citation |authorlink=Paul Davidson (economist) |first=Paul |last=Davidson |title=The Keynes Solution: The Path to Global Economic Prosperity |year=2009 |page=125 |isbn=978-0-230-61920-3 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York [/tpl]. In intuitive terms, if the domestic currency devalues (i.e. the cost of foreign goods increases relative to the cost of domestic goods), there will be a positive quantity effect on the balance of trade, because domestic consumers will buy fewer imports and foreign consumers will buy more of our exports; but offsetting this is a negative cost effect on the balance of trade, since the cost of imports will be higher. Whether the net effect on the trade balance is positive or negative depends on whether or not the quantity effect outweighs the cost effect; if the quantity effect is greater, then we say that the Marshall–Lerner condition is met. Essentially, the Marshall–Lerner condition is an extension of Marshall's theory of the price elasticity of demand to foreign trade.
Formally, the condition states that, for a currency devaluation to have a positive impact on trade balance, the sum of price elasticity of exports and imports (in absolute value) must be greater than 1. The net effect on the trade balance will depend on price elasticities. If goods exported are elastic to price, their quantity demanded will increase proportionately more than the decrease in price, and total export revenue will increase. Similarly, if goods imported are elastic, total import expenditure will decrease. Both will improve the trade balance.
Empirically, it has been found that trade in goods tends to be inelastic in the short term, as it takes time to change consuming patterns and trade contracts.{Bahmani-Oskoee & Ratha 2004 } Thus, the Marshall–Lerner condition is not met, and a devaluation is likely to worsen the trade balance initially. In the long term, consumers will adjust to the new prices, and trade balance will improve. This effect is called the J-curve effect. For example, assume a country is a net importer of oil and a net producer of ships. Initially, the devaluation immediately increases the price of oil, and as consumption patterns remain the same in the short term, an increased sum is spent on imported oil, worsening the deficit on the import side. Meanwhile, it takes some time for the shipbuilder's sales department to exploit the lower price and secure new contracts. Only the funds acquired from previously agreed contracts, now devalued by the currency devaluation, are immediately available, again worsening the deficit on the export side.

[[Mollen Commission]]

CATEGORIES: New York City Police Department, Police misconduct in the United States, Corruption in the United States

The Mollen Commission is formally known as The City of New York Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Corruption Procedures of the Police Department. Former judge Milton Mollen was appointed in July 1992 by then New York City mayor David N. Dinkins to investigate corruption in the New York City Police Department. Mollen's mandate was to examine and investigate “the nature and extent of corruption in the Department; evaluate the departments procedures for preventing and detecting that corruption; and recommend changes and improvements to those procedures”.
In December 1993, the New York Times reported that the "special mayoral panel asserted ... that the New York City Police Department had failed at every level to uproot corruption and had instead tolerated a culture that fostered misconduct and concealed lawlessness by police officers."[tpl]cite news|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|title=New York's police allow corruption, Mollen panel says|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/29/nyregion/new-york-s-police-allow-corruption-mollen-panel-says.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 Dec 1993[/tpl]
Mollen issued a report in July 1994. The conclusion:
 
 Today's corruption is not the corruption of Knapp Commission days. Corruption then was largely a corruption of accommodation, of criminals and police officers giving and taking bribes, buying and selling protection. Corruption was, in its essence, consensual. Today's corruption is characterized by brutality, theft, abuse of authority and active police criminality.

The Haverah Park experiment was a cosmic ray air shower detection array consisting of water Cherenkov detectors distributed over an area of 12 km2on Haverah Park on the Pennine moorland near Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The experiment was operated by University of Leeds for 20 years, and was switched off in 1987.
Air showers of secondary particles generated from a primary cosmic ray hitting the Earth's atmosphere are spread over many kilometres when they hit the ground. An array allows for detection of secondary particles caused by a single cosmic ray at several detectors. The geographic spread of the detectors allows for calculation of the following:
During its operation, many thousands of cosmic ray events were recorded including four exceptional events with energies over 1020 eV. These results were somewhat controversial because they are beyond the GZK limit. Such particles were since observed by other experiments, such as Fly's Eye (Oh-My-God particle) and AGASA.
The water Cherenkov detector array is one of two cosmic ray detection systems used by the currently operating Pierre Auger Observatory.

Mac Fhirbhisigh was the surname of a family of Irish  hereditary historians based for much of their known history at Leckan, Tireagh, Co. Sligo. They claimed descent from Dathí (d.418?/428?), said to be one of the last pagan Kings of Connacht, and were thus one of the many families who sprang from the Uí Fiachrach dynasty. 
Based initially at Cong, the family may have been erenaghs prior to becoming historians and genealogists to the Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe (branch of the Uí Fiachrach based in north Connacht) and several other patrons. While this was their main function, they also appear to have served as poets and brehons to their patrons, possibly even musicians. 
Among the earliest known members of the family were Amhlaoibh Mór mac Fir Bhisigh (died 1138), Domhnall na Sgoile Mac Fir Bhisigh (fl.c. 1250) and Gilla Isa Mac Fir Bisigh, who died in 1301. 
In the late medieval era the most well known was Giolla Íosa Mór Mac Fhirbhisigh fl. 1390-1418. Fear Dorcha MacFhirbhisigh (fl.c. 1600?) was noted as well-travelled in Scotland, showing how far afield members of the clan would venture in practiseing their art.
Dubhaltach MacFhirbhisigh (fl.c.1640-January 1671) compiled Leabhar na nGenealach, a massive compilation of Irish genealogies, a collection of much lore that would have been lost without trace in the turbulent Irish 17th century.
The name is now rendered as Forbes.

[[Frank Nuovo]]
CATEGORIES: 1961 births, Living people, American designers, Nokia people

[tpl]BLP sources|date=June 2009|bot=yes[/tpl]

Frank Nuovo (born 1961), an Italian American, has been a leading mobile phone industrial designer, and a former Vice President and Chief of Design at Nokia.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-146967148/frank-nuovo-leave-nokia.html
Nuovo started his professional industrial design career in 1986 working with Charles Pelly's Designworks. Early projects ranged from furniture to medical instruments and from consumer electronics and transportation interiors to complex air traffic and automated control systems workstation designs. Nuovo's work with Nokia began as a consultant in 1989 while continuing work at Designworks/USA in Agoura. After many successful projects for Nokia, in 1995 he began working for Nokia full-time, setting up Nokia's first dedicated industrial design and styling group and center in Los Angeles, California. Over the next decade (1995 to 2006) Nuovo led the creation of Nokia's first global design team, which, during his administration, included additional design centers in Finland and England, and also included remote design teams in Denmark, China, Japan, Germany and other locations in the USA.
During his time at Nokia, Nuovo was responsible for leading design strategy for what can be considered one of the most successful stories of growth and success in modern history. Innovations there combine technology, usability and style with user centered design. Nuovo and his team helped Nokia capture market share that maintained global leadership at levels more than twice that of the nearest competitor's global market share. While at Nokia, Nuovo was very active in brand development and renewal resulting in Nokia’s position as the worlds 6th most valuable brand (Interbrand).
Inspired by trend research experiences gained while at Designworks/USA, Nuovo led the creation of a colors and materials and graphics research group within Nokia Design.  In 2005, with Nuovo's vision of a new type of color and trend design research lab, and with substantial funding and support from Nokia, a crucial collaboration was formed with Art Center College of Design's Karen Hoffman and Martin Smith. This collaboration finally resulted in creation of The Art Center College of Design's Color Materials and Trends Lab (CMTEL).
Significantly during this period, in late 1997, Nuovo first formally proposed the creation of a luxury mobile phone brand, which eventually became known as Vertu. Working alongside his associate of many years, Dr. Peter Ashall, a full business case and go to market proposal was prepared, and then, in 1998 was accepted with funding and core technology supplied by Nokia.  While maintaining duties as Nokia Design's Vice President and Chief Designer, Nuovo also led the creative development of the Vertu brand identity and product portfolio as Creative Director and Principal Designer.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-115491336/upwardly-mobile-frank-nuovo.html Design Week, 2004 Vertu launched to the public in Paris in January 2002.
In late 2005, as Vertu was gaining momentum and profitability in the new luxury mobile phone market the company had pioneered, Nuovo began planning to leave his position at Nokia in order to focus on Vertu's success. Upon his departure from Nokia in April 2006, he maintained a role as Principal Designer at Vertu with concentration on the development of the Vertu brand and product portfolio - which he continues with Today. Additionally, Nuovo opened his own design studio in Southern California called Design Studio Nuovo, which he operates with his designer wife and business partner, Trina Nuovo. Design Studio Nuovo is where Nuovo is developing new ventures with technology and manufacturing partners from around the world.
Nuovo left Nokia while on a continuing upward corporate performance trend. With financials as reported by Nokia, during Nuovo’s last quarter, Nokia reported a 21% rise in first-quarter net profit due to strong performances at its mobile-phone and multimedia divisions. The world's largest cell phone maker stated sales rose 29% and its market share rose by three percentage points, from a year earlier, to 35%. At that point, the products designed by his team were manufactured at a rate of over four hundred million units per year. After departure from Nokia, Nuovo's portfolio legacy contributed positively to what was a continuing upward trend with Nokia gaining to a 38% market share with net sales rising 28% through to the second quarter of 2007.
Nuovo graduated with a bachelor of science in industrial design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1986. In December 2008, The Art Center College of Design honored Nuovo with the prestigious Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award. Additionally, The Art Center presented Nuovo with a doctorate of science degree in recognition of his life's work in the field of Industrial Design.
Nuovo’s design and innovation leadership has resulted in dozens of major awards and accolades around the world for him, and for his associates at Nokia and Vertu. These awards include several of Germany’s highly sought-after Red Dot and IF awards and American IDEA awards among many others. Nuovo’s work and that of his design teams have been featured in museums around the world including the Museum of Modern Art “Workspheres” (New York), and the Neus Museum Nurnberg Sammlung Design, The Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum permanent collection and as part of the design triennial and also the Essen Design Museum, Essen Germany.
Nuovo is an active lecturer at many international technical, marketing and design conferences, and academic venues around the world. Nuovo's life’s work and story has been featured in many regional and international publications and television shows globally.

[[Relativistic mechanics]]
CATEGORIES: Theory of relativity

In physics, relativistic mechanics refers to mechanics compatible with special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR). It provides a non-quantum mechanical description of a system of particles, or of a fluid, in cases where the velocities of moving objects are comparable to the speed of light c. As a result, classical mechanics is extended correctly to particles traveling at high velocities and energies, and provides a consistent inclusion of electromagnetism with the mechanics of particles. This was not possible in Galilean relativity, where it would be permitted for particles and light to travel at any speed, including faster than light. The foundations of relativistic mechanics are the postulates of special relativity and general relativity. The unification of SR with quantum mechanics is relativistic quantum mechanics, while attempts for that of GR is quantum gravity, an unsolved problem in physics.
As with classical mechanics, the subject can be divided into "kinematics"; the description of motion by specifying positions, velocities and accelerations, and "dynamics"; a full description by considering energies, momenta, and angular momenta and their conservation laws, and forces acting on particles or exerted by particles. There is however a subtlety; what appears to be "moving" and what is "at rest"—which is termed by "statics" in classical mechanics—depends on the relative motion of observers who measure in frames of reference.
Although some definitions and concepts from classical mechanics do carry over to SR, such as force as the time derivative of momentum (Newton's second law), the work done by a particle as the line integral of force exerted on the particle along a path, and power as the time derivative of work done, there are a number of significant modifications to the remaining definitions and formulae. SR states that motion is relative and the laws of physics are the same for all experimenters irrespective of their inertial reference frames. In addition to modifying notions of space and time, SR forces one to reconsider the concepts of mass, momentum, and energy all of which are important constructs in Newtonian mechanics. SR shows that these concepts are all different aspects of the same physical quantity in much the same way that it shows space and time to be interrelated. Consequently, another modification is the concept of the center of mass of a system, which is straightforward to define in classical mechanics but much less obvious in relativity - see relativistic center of mass for details.
The equations become more complicated in the more familiar three-dimensional vector calculus formalism, due to the nonlinearity in the Lorentz factor, which accurately accounts for relativistic velocity dependence and the speed limit of all particles and fields. However, they have a simpler and elegant form in four-dimensional spacetime, which includes flat Minkowski space (SR) and curved spacetime (GR), because three-dimensional vectors derived from space and scalars derived from time can be collected into four vectors, or four-dimensional tensors. However, the six component angular momentum tensor is sometimes called a bivector because in the 3D viewpoint it is two vectors (one of these, the conventional angular momentum, being an axial vector).

[[Tactical ballistic missile]]

CATEGORIES: Tactical ballistic missiles

A tactical ballistic missile is a ballistic missile designed for short-range battlefield use.  Typically, range is less than [tpl]convert|300|km|mi[/tpl].  Tactical ballistic missiles are usually mobile to ensure survivability and quick deployment, as well as carrying a variety of warheads to target enemy facilities, assembly areas, artillery, and other targets behind the front lines. Warheads can include conventional high explosive, chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. Typically tactical nuclear weapons are limited in their total yield compared to strategic rockets.  
Tactical ballistic missiles fill the gap between conventional rocket artillery and longer-range theatre ballistic missiles.  Tactical missiles can carry heavy payloads deep behind enemy lines in comparison to rockets or tube artillery, while having better mobility and less expense than the more strategic theatre missiles.  Additionally, due to their mobility, tactical missiles are better suited to responding to developments on the battlefield.
For many nations, tactical missiles represent the upper limit of their land-based military equipment.  They can provide a powerful weapon for a very economical price, and in some cases are sought to help level the field against opponents who are clearly superior in other areas of military technology.  Currently, ballistic missile technology is relatively accessible to nations that may find other military technology beyond easy reach.  
Ballistic missiles are still difficult to defeat on the battlefield.  Newer air defense systems have improved ability to intercept tactical missiles, but still can not reliably protect assets against ballistic missile threats.  This allows a moderate force of missiles to threaten a superior enemy by penetrating their air defenses better than with conventional aircraft, while providing a deeper strike than conventional artillery.

[[Université Notre Dame des Ombres]]

In DC Comics Université Notre Dame des Ombres ([tpl]lang-fr|Our Lady of the Shadows University[/tpl]) is a special university in France which was attended by the Crimson Fox twins and Dee Tyler (Phantom Lady).
Sandra Knight, the original Phantom Lady, became the dean of this School in her later years. She may have been an 'old girl' herself, as was the English girl Emma Knight, daughter of Sir John Knight, who went on to become an agent herself in the 1960s as Mrs. Emma Peel (see Action Comics Weekly #636).
Records of other graduates are still classified as "Top Secret", but given the school's location and 200 year history, it is possible that other female spies may well have passed through the doors of this fabled institution, including such as agents known under the code names of Sandra of the Secret Service, Mademoiselle Marie and Madame Zero.  Obviously, given the nature of these ladies' line of work, any form of verification is impossible.
Action Comics Weekly #641 reveals that the future Diana Tyler, mother of the second Phantom Lady, was connected to the college until the mid-1960s, although she may well have been a tutor rather than a trainee agent.

Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group.
Household income is not to be confused with family or personal income. Household income is often the combination of two income earners pooling the resources and should therefore not be confused with an individual's earnings.

[[Open matte]]

CATEGORIES: Film and video terminology, Video game development

Open matte is a filming technique that involves matting out the top and bottom of the film frame in the movie projector (known as a soft matte) for the widescreen theatrical release and then scanning the film without a matte (at Academy ratio) for a full screen home video release.
Usually, non-anamorphic 4-perf films are filmed directly on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 fullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame (open matte) instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and "protect" for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom microphones, cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).
Many films over the years have used this technique, the most prominent of which include Schindler's List and Top Gun. Stanley Kubrick also used this technique for his last five films.

Altruism in animals describes a range of behaviours performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/altruism|title=Altruism|  publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl]  Other definitions place emphasis on the genetic consequences of altruism, e.g. altruism is "Instinctive behavior that is detrimental to the individual but favors the survival or spread of that individual's genes, as by benefiting its relatives."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/altruism|title=Altruism|publisher=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl] or the biological fitness of the animals, e.g. "Altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/altruism|title=Altruism|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl] Altruism appears most obviously in kin relationships but may also be evident amongst wider social groups.
Altruism in animals is not identical to the everyday concept of altruism in humans. In humans, an action would only be called "altruistic" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. But in the animal behaviour sense there is no such requirement. Indeed, some of the most interesting examples of altruism in animals are found among species that are presumably not capable of conscious thought, e.g. insects. For the animal biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/|title=Biological altruism|author=Okasha, S.|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl]

WSTW (93.7 FM) is a CHR formatted radio station that broadcasts in the Wilmington, Delaware metropolitan area which is just south of Philadelphia. Although the station and transmitter are located in Wilmington, the signal is strong enough to provide city-grade coverage of most of Philadelphia itself and at least Grade B coverage of most of the Philadelphia area.  However, the station is only a minor factor in the Philadelphia radio market and focuses on Wilmington.  WSTW is the dominant young adult targeted radio station covering Wilmington and the southwestern suburbs of Philadelphia.  But even though, up until 2010, was considered adult top 40, it is still reported by Mediabase & Nielsen BDS as a contemporary hit radio station.  WSTW's 2010 shift towards a contemporary hit radio direction met reporting standards, mainly due to Clear Channel Communications' WISX Philadelphia returning to adult top 40 from rhythmic adult contemporary.  WSTW is  on the Nielsen BDS top 40 panel.
In May 2005, WSTW created the "Rewards" program for winning and obtaining prizes. The "Choice Rewards" system allows listeners of the station to bid on auctions for WSTW concerts, merchandise, etc., based on how many points the user has. Users obtain these points by typing in "Choice Words", which they hear on WSTW itself, on the "Rewards" website. The "Rewards" program was changed later, with "Choice Words" being solely found on the WSTW webpage, at station appearances, and via online surveys.  WSTW is owned by the Delmarva Broadcasting Company.
In 2006, WSTW was chosen as CHR Station of the Year of the Marconi Award by the National Association of Broadcasters.

[[Divine Adoratrice of Amun]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Egyptian priestesses, Ancient Egyptian titles

The Divine Adoratrice of Amun was a second title created for the chief priestess of the ancient Egyptian deity, Amun. During the first millennium BCE, when the holder of this office exercised her largest measure of influence, her position was an important appointment facilitating the transfer of power from one pharaoh to the next, when his daughter was adopted to fill it by the incumbent office holder. The Divine Adoratrice ruled over the extensive temple duties and domains, controlling a significant part of the ancient Egyptian economy.
God's Wife of Amun, a title for a similar office of the high priestess, originated as a title held by a daughter of the High Priest of Amun during the reign of Hatshepsut and continued as an important office while the capital of Egypt remained in Thebes. 
Later, the added title of Divine Adoratrice of Amun can be seen to accompany a resurgence of the title God's Wife of Amun which had fallen into disuse. The God's Wife title was revived in the 20th Dynasty, when Ramesses VI's daughter Aset held the office, as well as the additional office of Divine Adoratrice.Ian Shaw, The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press 2003, ISBN 0-19-280458-8 p.474  He reigned from 1145-1137 BC. She never married and seems to have been the first of the celibate holders of the office of Divine Adoratrice of Amun, as he stipulated along with the new tradition that she would adopt the daughter of the succeeding pharaoh as her successor at the end of his reign in order to facilitate the transition to the next pharaoh. Toby Wilkinson, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2005, p.93 Generally, the tradition was followed and the position was filled by the daughter of the current king, who was adopted as the daughter of the incumbent Divine Adoratrice. 
The new office reached the very heights of its political power during the late Third Intermediate Period of Egypt when Shepenupet I, Osorkon III's daughter, was first appointed to this post at Thebes. The Nubian king Kashta, in turn, appointed his daughter, Amenirdis, as her successor. The high status of this office is illustrated by the tomb of Amenirdis at Medinet Habu.4
Toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period and the start of the Late Period, during the 25th and 26th Dynasties, the office was at its height both politically and economically.  As the role of the high priests of Amun changed from a mostly spiritual to a more 'earthly' role, the Divine Adoratrice became the main focus of the cult of Amun in Thebes. During the twenty-sixth dynasty, the Saite king Psamtik I forcibly reunited Egypt under his rule in March 656 BC and he compelled the God's Wife of Amun serving at the time, Shepenupet II, daughter of Piye, to adopt his daughter as her chosen successor to this position.
When the Napatan kings from Kush started to extend their power into Upper Egypt, the reigning God's Wife of Amun, Shepenupet I, was persuaded to adopt Amenirdis, the daughter of Kashta as her heir. This sequence was followed throughout the 25th Dynasty until Egypt was conquered by Psamtek I, who had his daughter, Nitocris I, adopted by Amenirdis II. The Adoption Stelae of Nitocris'  shows the ceremony involved by this event, and the prestige of the role:J. H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Part Four, Chicago 1906, §§ 935-958
At this time, the dynastic rulers were based in the Nile Delta region, and the office of the Divine Adoratrice was a means to secure peaceful relations with the Theban area where the cult of Amun was centered. A number of the God's Wives had mortuary shrines constructed on the west bank of the river, mostly alongside the Medinet-Habu of Ramesses III.
Because of the power and prestige of the offices, the ceremony of adoption by the current incumbent of the post was used as a way for the kings of the delta area to project their power into the south of Egypt. In the same manner it was used by Napatan kings to project their power northward into Egypt proper. The power of the Divine Adoratrice of Amun was limited to the area around Thebes, which was the center of the cult.

The Federal Arbitration Act ([tpl]USStatute|68|401|43|883|1925|2|12[/tpl], codified at [tpl]USC|9|1[/tpl] et seq.) is an act of Congress that provides for judicial facilitation of private dispute resolution through arbitration. It applies in both state courts and federal courts, as was held in Southland Corp. v. Keating. It applies where the transaction contemplated by the parties "involves" interstate commerce and is predicated on an exercise of the Commerce Clause powers granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution.
The Federal Arbitration Act provides for contractually-based compulsory and binding arbitration, resulting in an arbitration award entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel as opposed to a judgment entered by a court of law. In an arbitration the parties give up the right to an appeal on substantive grounds to a court.
The Federal Arbitration Act requires that where the parties have agreed to arbitrate, they must do so in lieu of going to court.
Once an award is entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel, it must be "confirmed" in a court of law. Once confirmed, the award is then reduced to an enforceable judgment, which may be enforced by the winning party in court, like any other judgment. Under the Federal Arbitration Act awards must be confirmed within one year; while any objection to an award must be challenged by the losing party within three months. An arbitration agreement may be entered "prospectively"—that is, in advance of any actual dispute; or may be entered into by disputing parties once a dispute has arisen.
The Supreme Court ruled in Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc. that the grounds for judicial review specified in the FAA may not be expanded, even if the parties to the arbitration agreement agree to allow expanded review of the decision.
On June 20, 2013, the Court ruled in American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant that class action waivers contained in mandatory arbitration clauses were valid even if plaintiffs prove that it would not be economically practicable to maintain these actions individually.Mike Gottlieb, Details: American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, SCOTUSblog (June 20, 2013).American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, No. 12-133 (June 20, 2013).

He first attracted a cult following in 2003, after changing his name by deed poll to HM King Nicholas I, and founding a new empire from his royal seat – a four-berth caravan trailer just outside Sheringham, Norfolk.
Originally performed as a 'dare' with a friend, his new, royal persona soon took on a life of its own, as he sold peerages over the Internet, blagged his way into local high-society and pursued a relationship (unsuccessfully) with "fellow royal" Zara Phillips.
King Nicholas and the Copeman Empire (ISBN 0-09-189920-6) was published in June 2005 by Ebury Press/Random House. The book describes how—after being unemployed for several months, under pressure from his family to make something of himself, and dared by a friend—he changes his name by deed poll to HM King Nicholas I and founds a new empire from his Sheringham caravan.King Nicholas and the Copeman Empire

The Partita in D minor for solo violin (BWV 1004) by Johann Sebastian Bach was written during 1717–1723. Professor Helga Thoene suggests that this partita, and especially its last movement, was a tombeau written in memory of Bach's first wife, Maria Barbara Bach (who died in 1720), though this theory is controversial. The partita contains five movements, given in Italian as:These movements are more frequently listed by their French names on recordings and in some references[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=January 2013[/tpl] as Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue, and Chaconne.

[[Anti-psychologism]]
CATEGORIES: Theories of deduction

In logic, anti-psychologism is a theory about the nature of logical truth, that it does not depend upon the contents of human ideas but exists independent of human ideas.  The term was coined by Gottlob Frege (the most famous anti-psychologist of Logic), and has been the centre of an important debate in analytical philosophy, closely related to the internalism and externalism debate in logic and epistemology.
The rival thesis, psychologism, is not widely held amongst logicians, but it does have some high-profile defenders, for example Dov Gabbay.
Edmund Husserl was an important proponent of anti-psychologism, and this trait passed on to other phenomenologists, such as Martin Heidegger, whose doctoral thesis was meant to be a refutation of psychologism. They shared the argument that, because the proposition "no-p is a not-p" is not logically equivalent to "It is thought that 'no-p is a not-p'", psychologism does not logically stand. Psychologism was criticized in logic also by Charles Sanders PeircePeirce attacked the idea, held by some logicians at that time, that rationality rests on a feeling of logicality, rather than on fact. See the first of Peirce's 1903 Lowell Institute Lectures "What Makes a Reasoning Sound?", Essential Peirce v. 2, pp. 242-257. See also the portion of Peirce's 1902 Minute Logic published in Collected Papers v. 2 (1931), paragraphs 18–19 and 39–43. Peirce held that mathematical and philosophical logics precede psychology as a special science and that they do not depend on it for principles. whose fields included logic, philosophy, and experimental psychology,Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, pioneering decision analysis. He and Jastrow wrote "On Small Differences in Sensation", Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences (1885), 3, 73-83, presented 17 October 1884, reprinted in Collected Papers v. 7, paragraphs 21–35.

The Sixty-seventh United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1921 to March 4, 1923, during the first two years of Warren Harding's presidency.  The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Thirteenth Census of the United States in 1910. Both chambers had a Republican majority.

[[OzWin]]
CATEGORIES: Windows Internet software, CompuServe

OzWin was a client program which was used to connect to the CompuServe Information Service. It was a GUI program written in Delphi that ran on the Microsoft Windows operating system. It was published by Ozarks West Software Inc. and programmed by Steve Sneed. 
OzWin was born out of the earlier OzCIS program which was DOS based. OzWin allowed users to connect to CompuServe forums and batch download messages, files, and so forth from the server and then disconnect. They could then read the messages offline, and as well compose new messages and replies while offline. When they finished reading and composing messages, they could connect again to batch send all of the messages, as well as receive any new messages others had posted to the forums. This allowed users to batch upload and download messages and then work offline, minimising the time they were connected to CompuServe. This was important, since at that time, users were charged by the hour to connect to CompuServe, so remaining connected all the time was an expensive proposition and could quickly run up charges.
Like OzCIS, OzWin also had features for up- and downloading files to the forum libraries, plus a complete set of SysOp features such as moving and deleting messages, administering the file libraries, and "flagging" users (giving/denying SysOp rights, kicking/banning). 
Unlike other offline readers such as TapCIS and NavCIS which added proprietary ways of formatting text (colors, fonts, attributes), OzWin always remained "plain text" and never displayed any custom styles.

[[Chiral ligand]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry, Organometallic chemistry

In chemistry a chiral ligand is a specially adapted ligand used for asymmetric synthesis. This ligand is an enantiopure organic compound that combines with a metal center by chelation to form an asymmetric catalyst. This catalyst engages in a chemical reaction and transfers its chirality to the reaction product which as a result also becomes chiral. In an ideal reaction one equivalent of catalyst can turn over many more equivalents of reactant which enables the synthesis of a large amount of a chiral compound from achiral precursors with the aid of a very small (often expensive) chiral ligand.

The San Juan  (Spanish: Río San Juan), also known as El Desaguadero ("the drain"), is a 192.06 km (119.7 mi) river that flows east out of Lake Nicaragua into the Caribbean Sea. A large section of the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica runs on the right (southern) bank of the river. It was part, with the lake, of a proposed route for a Nicaragua Canal in the 19th century.

[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The Ecocanal project has obtained a Concession from the National Assembly of Nicaragua to re-open the San Juan River to commercial barge traffic.
The Cañas–Jerez Treaty states that Nicaragua owns the waters of the river and that Costa Rica can only use it for commercial navigation on certain parts of the river at Nicaragua's discretion. 
Prior to the Panama Canal, the San Juan River was frequently used as a major part of the route from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.  Many people, including African slaves, were transported via this route. During the California Gold Rush as many people from all over the world traveled to California to mine for gold, tens of thousands took a steamboat that was operated by the Accessory Transit Company and was directed by Cornelius Vanderbilt.[tpl]cite book|author=Greenberg, Amy S.|title=Manifest manhood and the Antebellum American empire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84096-1[/tpl] The boat travelled up the San Juan River and across Lake Nicaragua; a stagecoach completed the connection to the Pacific coast.

[[Muhammad Shamsuddeen III]]

CATEGORIES: Sultans of the Maldives, Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, 1879 births, 1935 deaths

Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen Iskander III, CMG, (Dhivehi: ސުލްޠާން މުޙައްމަދު ޝަމްސުއްދީން; 20 October 1879 – 12 March 1935) son of Ibrahim Nooraddeen and Kakaage Don Goma, was the Sultan of the Maldives first from 7 May 1893 and then again from 1902.
When he was 14 years, after the death of his father Sultan Ibrahim Nooraddeen, he was nominated as the Sultan only after the people expressed their dissatisfaction with the appointment of his eight-year-old half-brother as Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen V against the Law of Succession in the Maldive Islands. Shamsuddeen's succession to the throne was in part favoured by the fact that he was great-nephew to Muhammad Didi Ranna Baderi Kilegefanu, the prime minister to three successive Sultans, who strongly protested to the Ceylon Governor in Colombo on behalf of his discarded great-nephew.
From Malé, Shamsuddeen wrote to his great-uncle, to return and resume the post of prime minister. At this time Haajee Imaaduddeen, nephew of the late sultan Nooraddeen, who would take over the throne after 2 months, ran the country. Ibrahim Didi and some other members of the Council of Ministers ('little knowing what evil a decade was to bring forth') encouraged Haajee Imaaduddeen to seize the throne from the young sultan as they despised Muhammad Didi's complete control over his grandnephew Sultan Shamsuddeen. However the enthronement was based on the specious plea stating a unanimous dissatisfaction by the people regarding the existing sultanate with a 'mere lad as Sultan, not able to do or undo anything himself'. By this decree Haajee Imaaduddeen was raised to the throne and named Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI, with Ibrahim Didi as his prime minister.
Shamsuddeen came back to power again in 1902 after the peaceful Malé Revolution which took place while Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI temporarily quit his kingdom with the object of marrying the high-born Egyptian Sharifa Hanim, the daughter of Abd-ur Rakhman Khami Bhey, the Consul of Persia. Muhammad Shamsuddeen III's full coronation ceremony (the Ceremony of the Assumption of the State Sword of the Kingdom of the Maldive Islands) was not held until 27 July 1905. The ceremony was attended by Sir John Keene on behalf of Edward VII, the Katheeb of Kelaa of Thiladhummathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the northern atolls of the kingdom and the Katheeb of Isdhū of Haddhunmathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the southern atolls of the kingdom.
He was arrested on 2 October 1934 and was banished to Fuvahmulah with crown prince Henveyru Ganduvaru Manippulhu. The crown prince died there but later the Sultan was brought to Malé Atoll Villigili. The sultan died in Malé at the residence of Moonimaa'ge.
He is credited with bringing the first Constitution of Maldives on 22 December 1932.

A hypsometer is an instrument used in hypsometry, which estimates the elevation by boiling water – water boils at different temperatures depending on the air pressure, and thus altitude.
On Earth, the elevations can take on either positive or negative (underwater) values, and are bimodal due to the contrast between the continents and oceans.  On other planets within this solar system, elevations are typically unimodal, owing to the lack of oceans on those bodies.

Mirsad Bešlija (born 6 July 1979) is a Bosnian football player  who is currently playing for Bosnian side, FK Željezničar. He has also played for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.
Bešlija started his career with hometown side Slaven Živinice. Although he was among the youngest players in their squad, he became an important part of the first team. He was spotted there and signed by Bosna Visoko, a first division team at that time, in 1997. He spent two seasons in Visoko, during which he was selected for the national U21 team. His rapid footballing ascent attracted the interest of FK Željezničar and he signed for them in 2000, becoming a fans' favourite during his single season in the capital.
Bešlija joined Racing Genk in July 2001, where he stayed for five years, and made over 130 league appearances, and he won the Belgian League with them in 2003-04. He moved to Heart of Midlothian during January 2006 in a deal worth £850,000 (€1.22 million), a record fee paid by the Tynecastle side. A dispute developed about whether the overall transfer fee should include agents percentages or not, leading Hearts to suspend payment after the first installment.Genk threaten Hearts over Beslija, BBC Sport, 16 June 2006. When further dialogue brought no resolution, Genk petitioned UEFA to impose a transfer embargo upon Hearts,Genk urge signing ban for Hearts , BBC Sport, 26 October 2006. however, agreement was finally reached in December 2006, with Hearts paying the entire outstanding balance.Hearts pay Belgians for Beslija, BBC Sport, 22 December 2006. 
Beslija suffered serious injury problems with Hearts and he failed to win a regular first team place.

Americanist phonetic notation (variously called North Americanist Phonetic Alphabet, or APA) is a system of phonetic notation originally developed by European and American anthropologists and language scientists (students of Neo-grammarians) for the phonetic and phonemic transcription of Native American and European languages.  It is still commonly used by linguists working on Slavic, Indic, Uralic, Semitic, and Caucasian languages. The term "Americanist phonetic alphabet" is misleading because it has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, the journal of the German Oriental Society.

His son Marc-René served as Minister of War and was a noted bibliophile.
From 1720 to 1724, d'Argenson was Intendant of Hainaut, became privy counsel and from 1744 foreign minister. He negotiated with the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia to form a federation of Italian states. As last representant of the anti-Habsburg faction, he was overturned by intrigues at the Spanish court and appointed president of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. 
A friend of Voltaire and the Encyclopedists, and an attendee of the Club de l'Entresol, he turned writing scientific tracts, among them Considérations sur le gouvernement ancien et présent de la France (Amsterdam, 1764), and a tract important for understanding the inner machinations of France, Essais ou loisirs d'un ministre d'état, 2 vols. (Paris, 1787), rich in commentary and descriptions of noteworthy compatriots and anecdotes. His Memoirs are also of value as affecting the early and middle parts of Louis XV's reign.

Arnold Brown, OC (13 December 1913 – 26 June 2002) was the 11th General of The Salvation Army (1977-1981).
He was born in London, England, the son of officers of The Salvation Army. While he was still a young boy, his family immigrated to Canada, and it was from the corps in Belleville that he entered training, becoming an officer in 1935. A two-year corps command was followed by 10 years of service in the editorial department at territorial headquarters, where he became assistant editor of The War Cry. During that time he compiled a history of the first 50 years of Salvation Army ministry in Canada, entitled What Hath God Wrought?
Captain Brown and Lieutenant Jean Barclay were married 15 September 1939, and they gave 42 years of joint service before retiring from active leadership. They had two daughters, Heather Jean Brown and Beverley Ann Brown.
In 1962, the then Brigadier Brown was appointed as territorial youth secretary, an appointment where he gave vigorous leadership to the young Salvationists of Canada and Bermuda. Always an inspired leader of meetings and a fascinating speaker, his ministry among the young people of the territory left an indelible mark upon the lives and service of many of them.
In 1964, there came a return to public relations work, this time at international headquarters, where Lieutenant-Colonel Brown was appointed as secretary for public relations, being promoted to the rank of colonel just a few months later. His imaginative leadership gave birth to the 'For God's Sake Care!' campaign, which raised the army's profile significantly throughout the United Kingdom, and changed the face of The Salvation Army's public relations work for all time. It was also under his direction that advisory boards were established in the UK.http://www.salvoaudio.com/sermon/general_arnold_brown.htm
Brown had a long-standing involvement with the Rotary Club movement, rising to high office in the London club and internationally. In his capacity as a Rotarian he was invited to address many international conferences, including those in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1973 and in Montreal, Canada, in 1975. Whenever he addressed Rotary, he proudly presented the story of God's Army and its contribution to the relief of suffering and need around the world.
Following an outstanding period of service in public relations, Commissioner Brown was appointed chief of the staff (the army's second-in-command) in October 1969, where he served for five years before returning to Canada as territorial commander in 1974. Three years later, the High Council of The Salvation Army elected him to become the 11th General of The Salvation Army. He took office on 5 July 1977.
Upon election, when asked what he wanted Salvationists to do, Brown said, 'Everything they can to make better known Jesus Christ and his saving power as the only hope for a sinning, suffering world; everything they can to demonstrate indisputably in what they say and do that the grace of God enables men and women to live clean and holy lives filled with the joy of service to God and their fellows; in short, everything they can to bring Heaven to earth.'
Brown and his wife travelled extensively during the four-and-a-half years he was in office. In 1980, Brown inaugurated the International Staff Songsters in London, and he continued to maintain a lively interest in their ministry, both in the UK and many other countries where they have travelled.
Brown received many honours during his lifetime, recognising his contribution to the field of literature as well as his work in the interests of the poor and underprivileged of society. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1978, an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and, also in 1981, an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Asbury Theological Seminary and an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the Olivet Seminary in the USA.
Many books were written by Brown, including What Hath God Wrought?, The Gate and the Light (autobiography), The Mountain the Wind Blew Here, With Christ at the Table and Occupied Manger - Unoccupied Tomb. 
Brown died at age 92 in a hospital in Toronto, Canada. His remains were interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, Canada in The Salvation Army plot.

The 16th Army ([tpl]lang-de|16. Armee[/tpl]) was a World War II field army of the Wehrmacht.
It took part in the Battle of France. It was then deployed with Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It fought its way into northern Russia where in January 1942 part of it was encircled by the Soviets near Demyansk. Hitler forbade a withdrawal and the Army was re-supplied by air until a land corridor was opened in April 1942. It was subsequently involved in the siege of Leningrad. The Soviets relieved Leningrad in January 1944.
On February 19, 1944, the Soviet 2nd Baltic Front launched a fresh set of attacks against the German 16th Army around Kholm. The Soviet 22nd Army made good progress in the initial assault. These attacks greatly diminished the 16th Army. It, along with the 18th Army was cut off in the Courland Peninsula when the Soviets launched their summer and autumn offensives of 1944. It stayed trapped there until the end of the war. After the war, 250,000 German troops trapped in the Courland Pocket were marched into captivity, many were never heard from again.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

This stadium is one of the oldest in Mexico and its origins can be traced back to 1948. It is located in Zacatepec, Morelos. The official opening of this stadium was in November 1954. This stadium is nicknamed the Selva Cañera ("Sugar Cane Jungle") because of the tropical weather that distinguish the municipality of Zacatepec. There was a very famous player and later coach named Ignacio Trelles, who ordered to irrigate the field one hour before the soccer match, leading to a very strong vaporization and an increase of the  temperature to near 40 Celsius (more or less 100 Fahrenheit), that was very hard for the visitor squads. Another oddity of this building is that is it located very central in the town of Zacatepec and beside the sugar cane refineries.

[[Pouppée Fabrikk]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic body music, Swedish musical groups

Pouppée Fabrikk is a Swedish EBM band, started in 1988 by Henrik Björkk and Leif Holm, who both hail from Karlskoga. 
Initially, the music of Pouppée Fabrikk (PF) borrowed heavily from minimalistic electronic acts such as Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Nitzer Ebb, but with the addition of Jouni Olilla and Jonas Aneheim on guitar PF moved towards a more Die Krupps-style electronic/metal mix. The "Your Pain - Our Gain" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. 
In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled "Elite Electronics". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila. In October 2010, they once again re-united for a gig; this time at Bodyfest on Fryshuset.

[[The High and the Mighty (1954 song)]]

CATEGORIES: 1954 songs, Songs with music by Dimitri Tiomkin, Songs with lyrics by Ned Washington, Songs from films

"The High and the Mighty" is a song by Ned Washington and Dimitri Tiomkin from the film of the same name.The High and the Mighty, Soundtracks 
At the start of the film's production late in 1953, veteran film composer and musician Dimitri Tiomkin was commissioned to write the film's score.  The studio also urged Tiomkin to come up with a theme song for the film, to be released to radio and as a vinyl record. Tiomkin formed the basic melody to the song and enlisted songwriter Ned Washington to write the song's lyrics. What resulted was a gentle ballad. Warner Bros. presented the song to Les Baxter and his Orchestra, who recorded and released the song to coincide with the release of the film. When released in 1954, "The High and the Mighty" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Pop chart. 
Both the film score and the song were nominated for Academy Awards in 1955. The song (did not win) was sung by Johnny Desmond, accompanied by Muzzy Marcellino at the Awards Television show.Academy Award nominations Best Original Song Dimitri Tiomkin's score won the Academy Award that year.
Toward the end of the film, after John Wayne's character convinced the captain to try to make it to San Francisco rather than ditch, the captain said "Whistle me a tune, Dan. I like music when I work." Dan (John Wayne) whistled a bit of "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech" (Georgia Tech's famous and catchy fight song). Audiences at the time no doubt immediately recognized it and understood it was a sign of success, as Georgia Tech was in its glory years in football under Bobby Dodd, during which it won six bowl games in six years and was named National Champion by one organization in 1952.
A second and much rarer version of the title song lyrics also exists. In contrast to the romantic motif of the popular hit tune, the secondary version is instead a paean to the crews who guide the  airliners through the night skies towards distant cities, and concludes with an allusion to the "high and mighty" as the Deity. 
An instrumental version was also recorded in 1954 by the conductor and arranger LeRoy Holmes, reaching #9 on the Billboard chart. It became Holmes' biggest hit, and his most recognizable. The song is known for its distinctive whistling, which accompanies the music, and which was provided by Fred Lowery. (The whistling within the film itself was dubbed by Muzzy Marcellino.) Yet another hit version was recorded by Victor Young and his orchestra in 1954, peaking at #6 on the Billboard chart.
Another vocal version with the complete Ned Washington lyrics has been recorded by Billy Eckstine in his album 12 Great Songs from the movies from the early 1960s. An instrumental version by George Greeley was recorded on his 1959 Warner Bros. album, Greatest Motion Picture Piano Concertos.
The tune is whistled in the fadeout of the Simon & Garfunkel song "Punky's Dilemma", from their 1968 album Bookends. Toward the end of the 1980 film Seems Like Old Times, Chevy Chase's character can be heard whistling the tune as he walks away from the camera.

[[Cost of carry]]

CATEGORIES: Derivatives (finance), Financial economics, Financial terminology

The cost of carry or carrying charge is the cost of storing a physical commodity, such as grain or metals, over a period of time. The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument.Managed Futures
Trader Soft
If long, the cost of carry is the cost of interest paid on a margin account.  Conversely, if short, the cost of carry is the cost of paying dividends, or rather the opportunity cost; the cost of purchasing a particular security rather than an alternative. For most investments, the cost of carry generally refers to the risk-free interest rate that could be earned by investing currency in a theoretically safe investment vehicle such as a money market account minus any future cash-flows that are expected from holding an equivalent instrument with the same risk (generally expressed in percentage terms and called the convenience yield). Storage costs (generally expressed as a percentage of the spot price) should be added to the cost of carry for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.
The cost of carry model expresses the forward price (or, as an approximation, the futures price) as a function of the spot price and the cost of carry.
where
The same model in currency markets is known as interest rate parity.
For example, a US investor buying a Standard and Poor's 500 e-mini futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could expect the cost of carry to be the prevailing risk-free interest rate (around 5% as of November, 2007) minus the expected dividends that one could earn from buying each of the stocks in the S&P 500 and receiving any dividends that they might pay, since the e-mini futures contract is a proxy for the underlying stocks in the S&P 500.  Since the contract is a futures contract and settles at some forward date, the actual values of the dividends may not yet be known so the cost of carry must be estimated.

David Luke Flatman or 'Flats' (born on 21 January 1980 in Maidstone) is a former rugby player. He was a prop for Bath and the England national rugby union team.  He is now head of communications at Bath rugby.
He started playing rugby union at the age of eight at his local club, Maidstone FC, inspired by his father, who was a prop. A product of Dulwich College, he appeared in the same England Schools (18-group) squad as Steve Borthwick, Andrew Sheridan (also of Dulwich College), Alex Sanderson, Mike Tindall and Jonny Wilkinson.
Flatman toured Australia with England Schools in 1997 and the following year went to Argentina with England Colts. He represented London & South-West and England Under-21s against South Africa in the autumn of 1998.
His senior club rugby began with Saracens in 1998 and he won his first full caps as a replacement in the Tests against South Africa on the summer tour in 2000, when he also appeared in the matches against North-West Leopards and Gauteng Falcons.
He made a second tour with the England side to North America in the summer of 2001, appearing as a replacement for Graham Rowntree in the Burnaby and San Francisco Tests against Canada and the United States respectively. He had a wealth of A team experience having been a regular in the side since making his debut against France in Blagnac in 2000. He had a sequence of seven England A team games before being recalled to the senior squad for the final test of the 2000–1 season against France at Twickenham.
He moved to Bath in 2003, where he proved himself to be one of the finest front row forwards in English rugby union with his sterling performances in a revamped Bath pack.
He would surely have added to his eight caps on England's summer tour of New Zealand and Australia had injury not blighted his efforts.
Flatman announced his retirement from rugby on 15 June 2012. http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/news-comment/david-flatman-over-and-out-7856527.html

The Jefferson Market Branch, New York Public Library, once known as the Jefferson Market Courthouse, is located at 425 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), on the southwest corner of West 10th Street, in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City, on a triangular plot formed by Greenwich Avenue and West 10th Street. It was originally built as the Third Judicial District Courthouse from 1874 to 1877, and was designed by architect Frederick Clarke Withers of the firm of Vaux and Withers.
Faced with demolition in 1958, public outcry led to its reuse as a branch of the New York Public Library. The building is now part of the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission's Greenwich Village Historic District, created in 1969.[tpl]cite nycland[/tpl], pp.53-54 The AIA Guide to New York City calls the building "A mock Neuschwansteinian assemblage ... of leaded glass, steeply sloping roofs, gables, pinnacles, Venetian Gothic embellishments, and an intricate tower and clock; one of the City's most remarkable buildings."

CATEGORIES: Health care, Health informatics, Medical terminology, Medical treatments

Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) (also sometimes referred to as Computerized 'Provider Order Entry'' or ''Computerized Provider Order Management' ) is a process of electronic entry of medical practitioner instructions for the treatment of patients (particularly hospitalized patients) under his or her care. These orders are communicated over a computer network to the medical staff or to the departments (pharmacy, laboratory, or radiology) responsible for fulfilling the order. CPOE decreases delay in order completion, reduces errors related to handwriting or transcription, allows order entry at the point of care or off-site, provides error-checking for duplicate or incorrect doses or tests, and simplifies inventory and posting of charges. CPOE is a form of patient management software.Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009). http://healthit.ahrq.gov/images/jan09cpoereport/cpoe_issue_paper.htm

[[Reformed Esperanto]]

CATEGORIES: Esperantido, International auxiliary languages

Reformed Esperanto was a reformed version of Esperanto created in 1894.  It is notable as the only complete Esperantido to have been created by Esperanto's original creator, Dr. L. L. Zamenhof. Although Zamenhof's stated preference was to avoid any discussion of changes, he was put under considerable pressure (including financial) to respond to the diverse reforms proposed by others. Reluctantly he decided to present a reformed dialect himself and undertook to continue guiding the community, whether or not reforms were eventually agreed.
Although Zamenhof initially called his reform a systematic attempt to re-create the language in the light of more than six years of practical experience, scarcely any of the Esperanto community of the time accepted it as a whole. The majority voted to reject all changes. Zamenhof himself later rejected the whole project and referred to 1894 as 'a wasted year'. In 1907 he expressly refused permission to anyone wishing to re-publish the proposed reforms. In 1929 Johannes Dietterle cited this refusal as justification for omitting details of the reform project from his collection of Zamenhof's complete works, Originala Verkaro.
Some of the proposed reforms from 1894 such as replacing the -oj plural with -i, the removal of the diacritics and adjectival agreement were used in the language reform project Ido beginning in 1907, but these were not accepted by the Esperanto community either and Esperanto has changed relatively little since the publication of Zamenhof's Fundamento de Esperanto in 1905.

Closed-eye hallucinations and closed-eye visualizations (CEV) are a distinct class of hallucination.  These types of hallucinations generally only occur when one's eyes are closed or when one is in a darkened room.  They can be a form of phosphene. Certain users report closed-eye hallucinations under the influence of psychedelics. These are reportedly of a different nature than the "open-eye" hallucinations of the same compounds. Closed eye hallucination is directly related to a chronic type.

[[Axial chirality]]

CATEGORIES: Stereochemistry

Axial chirality is a special case of chirality in which a molecule does not possess a stereogenic center (the most common form of chirality in organic compounds) but an axis of chirality – an axis about which a set of substituents is held in a spatial arrangement that is not superposable on its mirror image. Axial chirality is most commonly observed in atropisomeric biaryl compounds wherein the rotation about the aryl-aryl bond is restricted, for example, biphenyl, binaphthyls, e.g., 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol, and certain dihydroanthracenone compounds. Absolute stereochemistry of fungal metabolites: Icterinoidins A1 and B1, and atrovirins B1 and B2 Melvyn Gill and Peter M. Morgan Arkivoc (RI-1154C)2004 Online article Certain allene compounds also display axial chirality. The enantiomers of axially chiral compounds are usually given the stereochemical labels Ra and Sa.Compendium of Chemical Terminology, axial chirality The designations are based on the same Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules used for tetrahedral stereocenters. The chiral axis is viewed end-on and the two "near" and two "far" substituents on the axial unit are ranked.

This property can also be called helicity, since the axis of the structure has a helical, propeller, or screw-shaped geometry. P (plus)  or Δ is a right-handed helix, where M (minus) or Λ is a left-handed helix.Compendium of Chemical Terminology, helicityVLU: Additional Chirality Elements - Chemgapedia The P/M or Δ/Λ terminology is used particularly for molecules that actually resemble a helix, such as hexahelicene. It can also be applied to other structures having axial chirality by considering the helical orientation of the "front" vs "back" Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rankings.

Hugh Donnithorne Vyvyan (born 8 September 1976 in Guildford) is a rugby union player who plays at lock for Saracens and England. He stands at 6'6" and weighs around 18 stone.
The former England fullback Jon Callard heavily influenced Hugh's early career while at Downside School, moving him from fly-half to number 8. Brother Charlie, was a number 8 for Sale Sharks, and was another big influence on his career. He also plays lock.
Vyvyan is youngest of seven brothers. In 1993 the brothers created rugby history by making up an entire team in the Penryn Invitation Sevens tournament, (played on Easter day each year in Penryn, Cornwall). The Seven Vyvyan brothers (Richard, Jonathan, Charles, Simon, Paul, James and Hugh) went on to win the tournament, defeating the host club 19 – 17 in the final. They returned the following year and defended the title, with Hugh flying back from South Africa to make up the numbers. In all the brothers reached the final five times, winning three times and twice being runners up.
He opted to take a year out after Downside School and played in South Africa for the Villagers club in Cape Town. Back in England he played briefly for Penryn before starting a successful theology degree at University of Newcastle, where he caught the eye of the Newcastle Falcons and eventually made his debut against Moseley, when the club were in National Division Two.
In 2001 he was an important member of Falcons’ Powergen Cup winning side at Twickenham, a feat he repeated in 2004 as captain.
In 2002 he toured with the full England side and was an unused bench replacement against Argentina.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/2060216.stm|title=Argentina beaten by England youngsters|publisher=BBC|date=22 June 2002|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] In that same 2002–2003 season he played for England A against Scotland A and Ireland A and, in December 2003, also helped an England XV beat the New Zealand Barbarians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/england-youngsters-rise-above-rough-treatment-577398.html|title=England youngsters rise above rough treatment|publisher=The Independent|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=23 June 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Hewett[/tpl]
As well as leading both Newcastle Falcons and now Saracens, he has captained the England A squad on two Churchill Cup tours. The first in 2003 saw England A take the cup and the second, in 2004, saw England A losing to the New Zealand Māori in extra time.

Ayyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of Ayya Vaikundar; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool. Accordingly, Vaikundar was the Purna avatar of Narayana. Ayyavazhi shares many ideas with Hinduism in its mythology and practice, but differs considerably in its concepts of good and evil and dharma.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 111–113, Ayyavazhi is classified as a dharmic belief because of its central focus on dharma.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, pp. 160–161.
Ayyavazhi first came to public attention in the 19th century as a Hindu sect.Dr. R. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India, p. 98.

MTV Unplugged is an extended play (EP) and live album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, released in the United States on June 2, 1992 by Columbia Records. Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on her lack of concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organised a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled MTV Unplugged, originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album Emotions, as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist. However, after its success, the show was released to the public as an EP, with an accompanying VHS titled MTV Unplugged +3.
Upon release, the EP garnered generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Carey's vocals. Commercially, the album was a success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200, and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over three million copies within the United States. Additionally, the EP experienced strong success in several international markets, such as the Netherlands and New Zealand, where it reached number one and was certified double platinum. MTV Unplugged peaked within the top five in the United Kingdom, and in the top ten in Australia and Canada.
"I'll Be There" was chosen as the lead single from the album. Due to its critical success up until that point, it was released one month before its parent EP, eventually becoming Carey's sixth chart topper in the United States, and one of the few songs to do so by two different acts. Globally, the song was successful, topping the singles charts in the charts in Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, as well as attaining the top five position in Ireland and the United Kingdom. After its success, "If It's Over", a song from Carey's second studio effort Emotions was released, due to its exposure on the show and EP.

[[Formula Ford]]
CATEGORIES: Racing formulas, Formula Ford, Motorsport categories in Australia

Formula Ford is an entry-level class of single seater, open-wheel formula racing. The various championships held across the world form an important step for many prospective Formula One drivers. Formula Ford has traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone into formula racing after karting. The series typically sees professional career minded drivers enter alongside amateurs and enthusiasts. Success in Formula Ford can lead directly to other junior formulae such as a Formula Renault 2.0 or even an F3 seat.
Formula Ford is not a one-make championship.  It allows freedom of chassis design, engine build and numerous technical items of specification on the car. This opens the door to many chassis manufacturers, large and small. Many other single-seater formulae impose fixed specifications. Only two other professional single seater racing formulae in the world offer the same freedom of chassis and engine build: Formula Three and Formula One.

Its first performance was in Prague at the Czech National Opera on 27 April 1927. It premiered in German, with the translation by Max Brod, at Breslau on 16 December 1928.

The Chinese People's Party  ([tpl]zh|c=中國民眾黨|p=Zhōngguó Mínzhòng Dǎng[/tpl]) is a small political party in the Republic of China on Taiwan that won three seats in the National Assembly election of 2005. It combines the Blue and Green platforms, upholding the Three Principles of the People while simultaneously aiming for Chinese unification. It operates on the principle "滅共復國" (Exterminate the Communists, Re-seize the Mainland) and its main electoral platform is to launch a large-scale military assault on Mainland China to reclaim it for the Republic of China.http://baike.baidu.com/view/996427.htm
The Chinese People's Party's President is Jeremy Lee, elected on 19th March 2013. He is concurrently the head of the New Revolutionary Alliance (新同盟會), which traces its party lineage to the anti-Japanese Tongmenghui found by Sun Yat-sen in 1905. Jeremy Lee caused international controversy recently by unfurling a Flag of the Republic of China in Canton, Kwangtung; and loudly proclaiming the rule of the Chinese Communist Party illegitimate. The photo has gone viral online, with netizens strongly supporting Jeremy Lee's firm stance for the reunification of China under the Republic of China banner. 
The Chinese People's Party has announced that they will hold a 2013 Penang Conference to discuss the next step forward in their goal to overthrow Communist Rule. The meeting will take place at the historical site of the 1910 Penang conference where Sun Yat-sen kickstarted the first steps towards overthrowing the Qing Dynasty.

F-sharp minor is a minor scale based on F-sharp, consisting of the pitches F[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], G[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], A, B, C[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl], D, and E. For the harmonic minor, the E is raised to E[tpl]music|sharp[/tpl]. Its key signature has three sharps.
Its relative major is A major, and its parallel major is F-sharp major.
Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary.
Very few symphonies are written in this key, Haydn's Farewell Symphony being one famous example. George Frederick Bristow and Dora Pejačević also wrote symphonies in this key.
The few concerti written in this key are usually written for the composer himself to play, including Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 1, Scriabin's Piano Concerto, Wieniawski's Violin Concerto No. 1, Vieuxtemps's Violin Concerto No. 2, and Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto.
In addition to the Farewell Symphony, Haydn's Piano Trio No. 40 (Hob. XV:26) and String Quartet Op. 50, No. 4 are in F-sharp minor.
Mozart's only composition in this key is the second movement to his Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major.p. 30 Hopkins London (1964) n. 1 Anthony Talking About Concertos Heinemann

[[Jahbulon]]

CATEGORIES: Freemasonry

Jahbulon (or Jabulon) is a word which was allegedly used historically in some rituals of Royal Arch Masonry, and derivations thereof.
There has been much debate over the origin and meaning of this word.  There is no consensus even among Masonic researchers as to its meaning or legitimacy: one Masonic scholar alleges that the word first appeared in an early 18th-century Royal Arch ritual as the name of an allegorical explorer searching for the ruins of King Solomon's Temple; another Masonic scholar believes it is a descriptive name for God in Hebrew; The most common masonic explanation is that it is a word derived from combining parts of the name of God in different historic languages.
Non-Masonic authors, especially those with an anti-masonic attitude, have alleged that it is a Masonic name for God, and even the name of a unique "Masonic God", despite repeated statements by Freemasonry's officials that "There is no separate Masonic God", nor a separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.grandlodge-england.org/masonry/A2L-religion.htm | title = Is Freemasonry a religion? | year = 2002 | accessdate=2007-05-08 | publisher = United Grand Lodge of England [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Smart | first = Earnest |date=April 2005 | title = Faith and Freemasonry | journal = Masonic Quarterly Magazine | issue = 13 | url = http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-13/p-46.php | accessdate = 2007-05-07 [/tpl]  It is this interpretation of a "Masonic God" that has led to debates about and condemnation of Freemasonry by several religious groups.  In England, no ritual containing the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989.Medway, Gareth J.

[[Microstrip]]

CATEGORIES: Microwave technology, Electronics, Signal cables

thumb|right|200px|Cross-section of microstrip geometry. Conductor (A) is separated from ground plane (D) by dielectric substrate (C). Upper dielectric (B) is typically air. Microstrip is a type of electrical transmission line which can be fabricated using printed circuit board technology, and is used to convey microwave-frequency signals. It consists of a conducting strip separated from a ground plane by a dielectric layer known as the substrate. Microwave components such as antennas, couplers, filters, power dividers etc. can be formed from microstrip, the entire device existing as the pattern of metallization on the substrate. Microstrip is thus much less expensive than traditional waveguide technology, as well as being far lighter and more compact.  Microstrip was developed by ITT laboratories as a competitor to stripline (first published by Grieg and Engelmann in the December 1952 IRE proceedings[tpl]cite journal|last=Grieg|first=D. D.|coauthors=Engelmann, H. F.|date=Dec 1952|title=Microstrip-A New Transmission Technique for the Klilomegacycle Range|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1644–1650|issn=0096-8390|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1952.274144[/tpl]).
The disadvantages of microstrip compared with waveguide are the generally lower power handling capacity, and higher losses. Also, unlike waveguide, microstrip is not enclosed, and is therefore susceptible to cross-talk and unintentional radiation.
For lowest cost, microstrip devices may be built on an ordinary FR-4 (standard PCB) substrate. However it is often found that the dielectric losses in FR4 are too high at microwave frequencies, and that the dielectric constant is not sufficiently tightly controlled. For these reasons, an alumina substrate is commonly used.
On a smaller scale, microstrip transmission lines are also built into monolithic microwave integrated circuits.
Microstrip lines are also used in high-speed digital PCB designs, where signals need to be routed from one part of the assembly to another with minimal distortion, and avoiding high cross-talk and radiation.
Microstrip is very similar to stripline and coplanar waveguide,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] and it is possible to integrate all three on the same substrate.

[[National Democratic League]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct political parties in the United Kingdom, Organizations established in 1900, Radicalism (historical)

The National Democratic League was a cross-party political organisation in the United Kingdom, which aimed to unite Liberal Party and former Independent Labour Party (ILP) members in a campaign for basic democratic reforms."The National Democratic League: 'belated and mutilated Chartism'", Logie Barrow and Ian Bullock, Democratic Ideas and the British Labour Movement, 1880-1914, pp.141-145
The League was founded in October 1900 on the initiative of William Thompson, editor of Reynold's News. Concerned by the Conservative Party majority in the 1900 UK general election and the establishment of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), he called the "Democratic Convention", aiming to bring together liberals and socialists on a basic democratic programme, inspired by Chartism.
The League's programme contained seven proposals: universal adult suffrage, automatic electoral registration, the abolition of multiple voting, for the state to cover election expenses, and to pay MPs, the abolition of the House of Lords, and the introduction of a two-round system of voting.
Although the programme was limited, it did attract the support of some branches of the ILP and Social Democratic Federation.  Their national organisations did not seek to prohibit them from participating, but were strongly critical of the limited focus of the League.
Tom Mann became the league's first Secretary, serving for three years; he was simultaneously employed as its full-time organiser.Frank Bealey and Henry Pelling, Labour and Politics, 1900-1906, p.51   He was succeeded by H. Victor Fisher.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.304  Thompson served as the President, while David Lloyd George, Robert Smillie, W. C. Steadman and Richard Bell were among its Vice-Presidents.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, pp.354-355Frank Bealey and Henry Pelling, Labour and Politics, 1900-1906, p.135
Although initial interest soon faded, Mann's work led to a short revival in its fortunes in 1902.  At this time, the League was particularly strong in London; by 1902, it had 31 branches there, with 34 in the remainder of the country.  However, it soon declined everywhere, particularly as the LRC gained strength and became the Labour Party.  Thompson lost interest in the organisation, and Frank Hugh O'Donnell took over the presidency, while the Fabian James E. Dobson became Secretary, and John Ward became Chairman.The Labour Annual 1908  It appears to have dissolved some time after 1911.

[[Swamp Angels]]
CATEGORIES: Historical gangs of New York City, Irish-American gangs

The Swamp Angels were a New York waterfront street gang during the mid nineteenth century. 
One of the most successful waterfront gangs of the period, the Swamp Angels dominated the dockyards of New York Harbor from the 1850s into the post-Civil War era. Their headquarters, a rookery on Cherry Street called Gotham Court, gave them access to the sewers under Cherry Street, and using these the gang was able raid the East River dockyards and sell off its valuable cargo within hours, before the theft was discovered the following morning. With the gang's success, police began posting snipers to guard the waterfront. However, when this did not slow the gang's activity the police were forced to send police into the sewers, which resulted in regular battles between the police and gang members. Eventually regular police patrols of the sewers forced the gang to halt its use of the sewers although the gang continued to hijacking cargo ships as they were being delivered onto the wharfs. The Swamp Angels were less visible after about 1860 but continued to operate on the waterfront, according to one source, until eventually they merged with the rival waterfront gangs into the White Hand Gang at the end of the century.

The Ring of Fire is both descriptive of the cosmic event as experienced by the series' characters, but also is at times used as the name for the series itself. The series is set in war-torn Europe during the middle of the Thirty Years' War.
Ring of Fire is a collection of short stories —half by a variety of established science fiction authors invited into the setting, half fan-fiction by enthusiasts who helped take the stand alone novel into a series numbering works in the tens of books; all set in the universe initially created by Flint's science fiction novel 1632 written as a stand-alone novel and turned into a series by popular demand. Unlike most short works in a novel created series, the stories within are important milieu shaping creations—story threads which are formalized into the series canon for they helped establish it, and act as a spring board for further developments in the books.

Sir Arthur William Buller (5 September 1808 – 30 April 1869) was a British Liberal Party Member of Parliament, who in his early career served as head of a commission of inquiry into education reform in Lower Canada.
From August 22 to November 2, 1838, he served as a member of the Special Council that administered Lower Canada following the Lower Canada Rebellion. Buller also prepared a report that made recommendations on further directions for education in the province. Although many of his suggestions were implemented, two key elements of the report, encouraging the use of English over the French language and an emphasis on generic Christian rather than Catholic religious education, were met with strong opposition.
After he left North America, Buller was crown attorney in Ceylon from 1840 to 1848 and judge of the Supreme Court of Calcutta in India from 1848 to 1858.
He was Member of Parliament for Devonport from 1859 to 1865, and for Liskeard from 1865 until his death in 1869.

The Duck Variations is a 1972 play by American playwright David Mamet. The play depicts a discussion taking place between two elderly men sitting on a park bench watching ducks. The dialogue begins with the mating habits of ducks and runs to examine law, friendship and death. The principal irony is that the men really know nothing about ducks. If they did, it would not improve their beautiful fugue on the theme of the possibility of happiness. Rather they use what experience has taught them and scattered, possibly incorrect ideas and facts to make guesses. They each assure the other that their guesses are established fact. By argument and occasional agreement a composite view of ducks and by extension, the world, begins to emerge.

Delaware Punch concentrate can be purchased from several online soft drink retailers. The bottled form is sold in Guatemala and Mexico, but is currently banned in much of  the United States due to a coloring agent, allura red, used [tpl]fact|date=June 2012[/tpl]. Delaware Punch was commonly sold at the New Orleans drug store chain K&B, before it was bought by Rite Aid in 1997.

[[County island]]

CATEGORIES: Local government in the United States, Urban planning in the United States, Urban studies and planning terminology

A county island is an unincorporated area within a county, usually, but not always, surrounded on all sides by another incorporated area, such as a city. On maps, these geopolitical anomalies will form jagged or complex borders and 'holes' in the city limits. Generally found more frequently in the western United States, county islands form in areas of expansion when previously smaller cities will annex and incorporate more land into their jurisdiction. If residents or landowners in a particular unincorporated area do not vote to incorporate with the surrounding city, the area remains unincorporated. The formation of a county island usually follows stages where it will come into being on the edge of an incorporated area, and as more territory is incorporated, be cut off from the rest of the unincorporated area within the county. These areas are not, by definition, exclaves because they are simply unincorporated within a surrounding city.

The Red River Campaign or Red River Expedition comprised a series of battles fought along the Red River in Louisiana during the American Civil War from March 10 to May 22, 1864. The campaign was a Union initiative, fought between approximately 30,000 Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, and Confederate troops under the command of Lt. Gen. Richard Taylor, whose strength varied from 6,000 to 15,000.
The campaign was primarily the plan of Union General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, and a diversion from Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's plan to surround the main Confederate armies by using Banks's Army of the Gulf to capture Mobile, Alabama. It was a Union failure, characterized by poor planning and mismanagement, in which not a single objective was fully accomplished. Taylor successfully defended the Red River Valley with a smaller force. However, the decision of Taylor's immediate superior, General Edmund Kirby Smith to send half of Taylor's force north to Arkansas rather than south in pursuit of the retreating Banks after the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill, led to bitter enmity between Taylor and Kirby Smith.

American Caesar: Douglas MacArthur, 1880-1964 is a 1978 biography of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur by American historian William Manchester. It was made into a documentary series in 1983 hosted by John Huston.
Manchester paints a sympathetic but balanced portrait of MacArthur, praising the general for his military genius, administrative skill, and personal bravery, while criticizing his vanity, paranoia, and tendency toward insubordination.  As the title suggests, Manchester's central thesis is that MacArthur was an analogue of Julius Caesar, a proposition he supports by noting their great intellect, brilliant strategic generalship, political ambition, magnanimity as conquerors, and shared tragic flaw of hubris.

The [tpl]lang|de|Volkshalle[/tpl] (“People's Hall”), also called [tpl]lang|de|Große Halle[/tpl] (“Great Hall”) or [tpl]lang|de|Ruhmeshalle[/tpl] (“Hall of Glory”), was a huge domed monumental building planned by Adolf Hitler and his architect Albert Speer for Germania. The project was never accomplished.
The word Volk had a particular resonance in Nazi thinking. The term völkisch movement, which can be translated to English as "the people's movement" or "the folkish movement", derives from [tpl]lang|de|Volk[/tpl] but also implies an otherworldly and eternal essence.  Before the First World War, völkisch thought had developed an attitude to the arts as the German [tpl]lang|de|Volk[/tpl]; that is, from an organically linked Aryan or Nordic community ([tpl]lang|de|Volksgemeinschaft[/tpl]), racially unpolluted and with its roots in the German soil of the Heimat (homeland).

[[Present sense impression]]
CATEGORIES: Hearsay

A present sense impression, in the law of evidence, is a statement made by a person (the declarant) that conveys his or her sense of the state of an event or the condition of something.  The statement must be spontaneously made while the person was perceiving (i.e. contemporaneous with) the event or condition, or "immediately thereafter."  The permissible time lapse between event and statement may range from seconds to minutes, but probably not hours.  The subject matter and content of the statement are limited to descriptions or explanations of the event or condition, therefore opinions, inferences, or conclusions about the event or condition are not present sense impressions.  An example of present sense impression is of a person saying, "it's cold" or "we're going really fast".
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence 803(1), a statement of present sense impression is an exception to the prohibition on use of hearsay as evidence at a trial or hearing, and is therefore admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (i.e. to prove that it was in fact cold at the time the person was speaking, or to prove that the person was indeed traveling very fast).  The basis for this exception is the belief that the statement is likely reliable and true, as there is no time for reflection, distortion, or fabrication.
The witness testifying about the statement need not be the declarant who, with firsthand knowledge about the event and condition, would normally make a better witness.  The witness must have personal knowledge of declarant's making of the statement, but need not have personal knowledge of the event or the content of the statement.  For example, a policeman observed from a distance that a reporter was dictating into a voice-recorder while a shooting was going on, but could not hear what the reporter was dictating.  The reporter is unavailable to testify.  The policeman testifies that he saw the reporter make the dictation.  Upon proper authentication, that portion of the audio-recording containing descriptions or explanations of the shooting is admissible as present sense impression.

Xenacanthus is a genus of prehistoric sharks. The first species of the genus lived in the later Devonian period, and they survived until the end of the Triassic, 202 million years ago. Fossils of various species have been found worldwide.
Xenacanthus had a number of features that distinguished it from modern sharks. This freshwater shark was about one meter (three feet) in length.[tpl]cite book |first=Richard M.|last=Gaines|title=Coelophysis|year=2001 |publisher= ABDO Publishing Company|pages= 17|isbn= 1-57765-488-9[/tpl]  The dorsal fin was ribbon-like and ran the entire length of the back and round the tail, where it joined with the anal fin. This arrangement resembles that of modern conger eels, and Xenacanthus probably swam in a similar manner. A distinctive spine projected from the back of the head, and gives the genus its name. The teeth had an unusual V-shape, and it probably fed on small crustaceans, and heavily scaled palaeoniscid fishes.[tpl]cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 27|isbn= 1-84028-152-9[/tpl]
As in all fossil sharks, Xenacanthus is mainly known because of fossilised teeth and spines.

DYSEAC was the Second Standards Electronic Automatic Computer.  (See SEAC.) 
DYSEAC was a first-generation computer built by the National Bureau of Standards for the US Army Signal Corps.  It was housed in a truck, making it one of the first portable computers (perhaps the first).  It went into operation in April 1954.
DYSEAC used 900 vacuum tubes and 24,500 crystal diodes. It had a memory of 512 words of 45 bits each (plus one parity bit), using mercury delay line memory.  Memory access time was 48-384 microseconds.  The addition time was 48 microsecond and the multiplication/division time was 2112 microseconds.  These times are excluding the memory access time, which added up to approximately 1500 microseconds to those times.

[[Excited utterance]]
CATEGORIES: Hearsay

An excited utterance, in the law of evidence, is a statement made by a person in response to a startling or shocking event or condition. It is an unplanned reaction to a "startling event".  It is an exception to the hearsay rule.[tpl]cite book |first1=Brian A., Editor in Chief, |last1=Garner |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7 |page=585 |year=1999 |publisher=West Publishing |location=St. Paul, MN, USA |isbn=0314199500[/tpl]  The statement must be spontaneously made by the person (the declarant) while still under the stress of excitement from the event or condition.  The subject matter and content of the statement must "relate to" event or condition.  The statement could be a description or explanation (as required for present sense impression), or an opinion or inference.  Examples include: "Look out! We're going to crash!" or "I think he's crazy.  He's shooting at us!"  The basis for this hearsay exception is the belief that a statement made under the stress is likely to be trustworthy and unlikely to be premeditated falsehoods.  Compared to present sense impression, excited utterance is broader in scope for permitting a longer time lapse between event and statement, and a wider range of content in the statement.
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is a hearsay exception, and is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (e.g., in the case of the first quotation above, to prove that the vehicle the declarant was riding in was, in fact, about to crash).  To prove the truth of the statement means to persuade the finder of fact to believe the affirmative sense of the statement.  "Truth" here does not mean truth from the subjective point of view of the declarant or from the objective point of view of a reasonably prudent person.  It simply refers to the affirmative assertion of the statement.
Spontaneity of the declarant is a key to admissibility.  An excited utterance does not have to be made at time of the startling event, but must be made while the declarant is still in a state of surprise or shock from the incident.  The declarant's reflective powers must be stilled, meaning that, while making the statement, the declarant would not have had a chance to reflect upon the startling event, fabricate a purposefully false statement, and then say it.  If the declarant is believed to have had time to reflect on the situation before making the statement, the statement would not be spontaneous and thus not an excited utterance.  However, under certain circumstances, it is possible for days to have passed before the declarant fully reflects on the event, and "unstills" his or her reflective powers.
Spontaneity is established by the declarant's demeanor, time lapse, and content of the statement.  Declarant's appearance of calmness at time statement lessens admissibility.  Time lapse between the startling event and the statement is a factor for both admissibility and weight.  A statement made long after the event may be deemed less spontaneous than one made contemporaneously or shortly after.  Outer limit of the permissible time lapse can only be determined from the circumstances of a particular case.  For example, if a declarant made a statement six days after a car crash due to the extent of his injuries, admissibility of the statement is diminished because of the significant passage of time.  However, if evidence shows that he was continuously distraught and did not yet have a chance to reflect upon the crash, the statement could be admissible but may have less weight than if the statement had been made one hour after the crash.  A complete and detailed statement may infer the lack of spontaneity, as a narrative of a past completed event would require the declarant's reflection and organization. A similar case involved a woman who had been in a coma for thirty days following a car crash. When she awoke and was told what had happened she exclaimed "I must have fallen asleep!" At trial, her statement was admitted even though a month had passed because the startling event was perceived to be the telling of the news, as opposed to the crash itself.

The X Club was a dining club of nine men who supported the theories of natural selection and academic liberalism in late 19th-century England. Thomas Henry Huxley was the initiator: he called the first meeting for 3 November 1864.Desmond A. 1994. Huxley: the Devil's disciple. Joseph, London. p327 et seq. The club met in London once a month—except in July, August and September—from November 1864 until March 1893, and its members are believed to have wielded much influence over scientific thought. The members of the club were George Busk, Edward Frankland, Thomas Archer Hirst, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, John Lubbock, Herbert Spencer, William Spottiswoode, and John Tyndall, united by a "devotion to science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4807.html#mark-4807.f8 |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 4807 – Hooker, J. D. to Darwin, C. R., (7–8 Apr 1865)  |accessdate=1 December 2008[/tpl]
The nine men who would compose the X Club already knew each other well. By the 1860s, friendships had turned the group into a social network, and the men often dined and went on holidays together. After Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, the men began working together to aid the cause for naturalism and natural history. They backed the liberal Anglican movement that emerged in the early 1860s, and both privately and publicly supported the leaders of the movement.
According to its members, the club was originally started to keep friends from drifting apart, and to partake in scientific discussion free from theological influence. A key aim was to reform the Royal Society, with a view to making the practice of science professional. In the 1870s and 1880s, the members of the group became prominent in the scientific community and some accused the club of having too much power in shaping the scientific landscape of London. The club was terminated in 1893, after depletion by death, and as old age made regular meetings of the surviving members impossible.

[[Norman W. Walker]]

CATEGORIES: People in alternative medicine, British nutritionists, 1886 births, 1985 deaths, Longevity traditions, Raw foodists

Norman Wardhaugh Walker (January 4, 1886 – June 6, 1985) was a British businessman and pioneer in the field of vegetable juicing and nutritional health. He advocated the drinking of fresh raw vegetable and fruit juices, both to regain and to maintain one's health. Based on his design, the Norwalk Hydraulic Press Juicer was developed. This juicer continues to be produced and sold today. Walker wrote several books on nutrition and healthy living.
Walker was notable for at least three reasons: (1) He was the author of at least six books published from 1937 to 1978. (2) He was the inventor of an important and innovative commercial juicer that is still manufactured today. (3) He was a pioneer in the raw foods, juicing, and vegetarian movements, each of which has grown in size and scope over the years.
As of 2006, most book reviews and promotional web sites wrongly claim that Walker reached the phenomenal age of, variously, 109, 113, 116, 118 or even 119 years. Several official sourcesThe 1901 English census lists a Norman W. Walker as a boarder, giving his age as "15", his occupation as "clerk", his citizenship as English, but his place of birth as "Italy".In the Ellis Island Records a Norman W. Walker can be found as passenger No. 19 aboard the RMS Lusitania arriving in New York Harbor from Liverpool in October 1910. He gives his age as "25", his citizenship as "English", his place of birth as "Italy".1 A Norman Wardhaugh Walker filed a Petition For Naturalization dated August 6, 1918. According to that document, he stated that: (1) he is living at 94 Grove Street, New York City, (2) his occupation is aviator, (3) he was born in Genoa, Italy on 4 January 1886 as a British Subject, (4) he is married to Margaret Oleott, who was born on the 26th day of July, 1888 in the U.S.A., that she "now resides at Farmingdale, L.I." and that he has no children. 2 On November 22, 1918, Norman Wardhaugh Walker took an Oath of Alligence to the USA & was admitted to citizenship by the NY County Court that day under Certificate of Naturalization No. 920727. the U.S. Social Security Death IndexUnited States Social Security Number 528-50-4312 belongs to a Norman Walker and states that he was born 4 January 1886 and died in June 1985. The record also states that the SS# was issued in Utah, and that his last residence was Cottonwood, Yavapai, Arizona.

Also referred to in English both as running script and by its Mandarin Chinese name, xíngshū, it is derived from clerical script, and was for a long time after its development in the 1st centuries AD the usual style of handwriting.
Some of the best examples of semi-cursive can be found in the work of Wang Xizhi (321-379) of the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

[[Group collaboration software]]
CATEGORIES: Collaboration, Groupware, Virtual communities

Group collaboration software provides tools for groups of people or organizations to share information and coordinate activities. IBM Lotus Notes, developed originally by Lotus Corporation, is considered one of the first commercially successful group collaboration tools. Many other applications and services have been developed and offered to the marketplace as well. The field is also sometimes referred to as collaborative software. 
These tools typically include member and email list management, a shared address book, shared calendar, project/task management, a shared file system, and tools for online collaborative document creation such as wikis, blogs, discussions boards, etc.  Some services offer a suite of integrated tools while others focus on delivering a single solution like shared file storage.
The UK Centre for Learning and Performance Technologies describes group collaboration tools as related to but different from social networking tools and content management systems.Directory of Learning Tools
Jon Udell's influential Practical Internet Groupware is a standard design guide for networked collaboration tools. Udell recommended they be built on top of existing standards, like email servers, news servers, and web servers.Practical Internet Groupware, O'Reilly, 1999
A number of free online group collaborations solutions exist. In 2000 Yahoo purchased eGroups and renamed the service Yahoo! Groups. This is probably the most widely used service although other companies such as AOL and Microsoft also offer online group solutions. More recently a number of startups like Wiggio, AirSet and Groopt, have emerged to take advantage of newer browser technologies like Ajax to deliver more sophisticated applications in their collaboration suites.
Wikis work well for group collaboration and they appear to be one of the major innovations in group collaboration. Now being incorporated into college courses to help familiarize students with the process of group collaboration. Wikipedia seems to be the most representative example in the public domain, while several success stories (such as PBwiki) can be found in the corporate field. Google Groups combines email, web-forum, and a group wiki.

Black Friday (Dhivehi: ކަޅު ހުކުރު), Friday, August 13, 2004, was the crackdown by the Maldivian National Security Service (NSS) — later Maldivian National Defence Force — on a peaceful protesthttp://news.amnesty.org  Nature of demonstration as defined by Amnesty in the capital city of Maldives, Malé. This unplanned and unorganized demonstration was the largest such protest in the country's history. Beginning on the evening of August 12, 2004, the demonstration grew and continued until it was forcefully ended on the afternoon of August 13, 2004.  Protesters initially demanding the freeing of the pro-reformists arrested on the afternoon of August 12, 2004. As the protest continued to grow, people demanded the resignation of president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had been in power since 1978. What started as a peaceful demonstration ended after 22 hours, as the country's darkest day in recent history. Several people were severely injured as NSS personnel used riot batons and teargas on unarmed civilians.
Pursuant to the powers vested in him by Section 144 of the Constitution — and for only the second time in Maldives history — president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom declared a State of Emergency in Malé and the nearby islands a few minutes after the crackdown. Several members of the Majlis, former cabinet ministers, and many reformists were arrested. As a symbol of unity, President Gayoom pardoned all arrested following the December 26th tsunami.

[[Reticella]]

CATEGORIES: Lace, Textile arts of Italy, Textile arts of France

Reticella (also reticello or in French point coupé or point couppe) is a needle lace dating from the 15th century and remaining popular into the first quarter of the 17th century. 
Reticella was originally a form of cutwork in which threads were pulled from linen fabric to make a "grid" on which the pattern was stitched, primarily using buttonhole stitch.  Later reticella used a grid made of thread rather than a fabric ground.  Both methods resulted in a characteristic geometric design of squares and circles with various arched or scalloped borders.
Books of patterns for reticella designed by Federico de Vinciolo (France, 1587) and Cesare Vecellio (Italy, probably from the 1590s but printed 1617) were popular and were frequently reprinted.
Reticella developed into Punto in Aria.

[[Sidney Root]]

Sidney Root (March 14, 1824–1897) an American businessman.
Root was born in Montague in western Massachusetts, but early in his life his family moved to Vermont, where his boyhood days were spent in the shadow of the Green Mountains. On his father's plantation he acquired the industrious habits which characterized him through life. Though prevented by reason of his father's limited resources from attending school more than three months in the year, he made the most of his meager opportunities and soon found architecture was the passion of his youthful mind. He possessed exceptional talents for skillful and accurate designing, but his practical father considering that such an accomplishment was comparatively worthless, refused to encourage it, and so apprenticed his fourteen-year-old son to an indifferent sort of a jeweler who taught him the business of watch-making. 
In the early 1840s, he came to Lumpkin, Georgia to clerk for Vermont-native William A. Rawson who married Root's sister in 1843. He did well but wanted larger opportunities. In the early summer of 1857 he came to Atlanta to co-partner a dry-goods business with Mr. J.N. Beach.  In the autumn of that year, on the railroad from St. Louis to Chicago, he met with accident which broke his hand and arm in five places.
In the Spring of 1861, he decided to support secession over union.  At the beginning of the American Civil War he helped organize the Board of Direct Trade to ensure Confederate trade to Europe was not disrupted. In this capacity he was sent to Europe but he returned home only to find his immense property interests destroyed by the invader and himself under arrest. As soon as he obtained his release he sold out his remaining fragments of real estate to Gov. Joseph E. Brown and went to New York, where he again established himself in business, maintaining connection with Liverpool and Charleston. He also helped establish the Mount Olivet Church at the request of freed southern negroes.  He remained in New York until 1878 when he closed out his business in the metropolis and came to Atlanta.  Back in Atlanta he continued his philanthropy work.  He served as a trustee for Spellman Seminary, and through his association with Colonel Lemuel P. Grant, was given charge of constructing the L.P. Grant Park and being its Park Superintendent.  
From the date of his return until the time of his death he was one of its foremost citizens and when it was decided to hold the International Cotton Exposition in 1881, Mr. Root was commissioned to visit Europe in behalf of the enterprise where he successfully sold shares in the corporation.
Root was a great lover of nature and he suggested old colleague Lemuel Grant donate land to create a park. Soon after, in 1883, Root was named park commissioner by mayor John B. Goodwin in which office he was largely responsible for the construction of Grant Park. He served as chairman of the city's board of park commissioners for years, bringing to bear his artistic tastes as well as his ripe experience in beautifying what was then a resort at Grant Park. 
His two sons were architects: John Wellborn Root, chief architect of the World Columbian Exposition and Walter Root in Kansas City.

The Calico Liberty is a roller-delayed blowback-operated semi-automatic rifle (Liberty II) or pistol (Liberty III) chambered for the 9 mm Para round, designed by Calico Light Weapons Systems. These firearms use an unusual 50 or 100-round helical magazine that allow for a large number of rounds in a relatively compact and convenient package. The spent cartridges are discharged in an unusual fashion as well: downward, ahead of the trigger guard. This makes it relatively easy to fit an effective device to catch the cartridge cases, which can then be reloaded. A full-automatic (machine gun) version is available for military, police and other government agencies.

The Games 100 first appeared in the November/December 1980 issue as an alphabetic list of the 100 games preferred by the editors of the magazine. In 1981, Games introduced The Games 100 Contest, which involved identifying pieces from games listed in the Games 100, with the grand prize being more than half of the games on that list. Games continues to publish this list as "The Buyers Guide to Games", broken out into "The Traditional Games 100" and "The Electronic Games 100".
Lists are published in either the November or December issue.  Through 1994, the lists for a year were published at the end of that year.  Starting in 1995, lists are released at the end of the year prior to the year of the list. (This means that there was no list for 1995.  There was also no list for 1990, because Games was temporarily out of publication during the period when the list would have been published.)  There are several categories for which "best" games are determined. 
The winner of the historical category for approximately the last ten years has been determine by one individual, Walt O'Hara, who runs the Historicon miniatures convention.

[[Novation]]

CATEGORIES: Business law, Financial terminology

In contract law and business law, novation is the act of either: 
In contrast to an assignment, which is valid so long as the obligee (person receiving the benefit of the bargain) is given notice, a novation is valid only with the consent of all parties to the original agreement: the obligee must consent to the replacement of the original obligor with the new obligor.[tpl]cite web|last=Duhaime|first=Lloyd|title=Part 6: Restraint of Trade, Assignment, Novation & Frustration|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/Contracts/LawArticle-91/Part-6-Restraint-of-Trade-Assignment-Novation-Frustration.aspx|work=duhaime.org|publisher=Duhaime's Contract Law|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=25 May 2012[/tpl]  A contract transferred by the novation process transfers all duties and obligations from the original obligor to the new obligor.
For example, if there exists a contract where Dan will give a TV to Alex, and another contract where Alex will give a TV to Becky, then, it is possible to novate both contracts and replace them with a single contract wherein Dan agrees to give a TV to Becky. Contrary to assignment, novation requires the consent of all parties. Consideration is still required for the new contract, but it is usually assumed to be the discharge of the former contract.
Another classic example is where Company A enters a contract with Company B and a novation is included to ensure that if Company B sells, merges or transfers the core of their business to another company, the new company assumes the obligations and liabilities that Company B has with Company A under the contract. So in terms of the contract, a purchaser, merging party or transferee of Company B steps into the shoes of Company B with respect to its obligations to Company A.  Alternatively, a "novation agreement" may be signed after the original contract[tpl]cite web|last=Duhaime|first=Lloyd|title=Novation Definition|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/N/Novation.aspx|work=duhaime.org|publisher=Duhaime's Legal Dictionary|accessdate=30 July 2013|year=2009[/tpl]  in the event of such a change. This is common in contracts with governmental entities; an example being under the United States Anti-Assignment Act, the governmental entity that originally issued the contract must agree to such a transfer or it is automatically invalid by law.
The criteria for novation comprise the obligee's acceptance of the new obligor, the new obligor's acceptance of the liability, and the old obligor's acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract. Novation is not a unilateral contract mechanism, hence allows room for negotiation on the new T&Cs under the new circumstances. Thus, 'acceptance of the new contract as full performance of the old contract' may be read in conjunction to the phenomenon of 'mutual agreement of the T&Cs.

Ezra J. Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut was an American inventor, who patented his design of a can opener in 1858.  Crudely shaped bayonet and sickle combo, his design was widely accepted by the U.S. military during the period of the American Civil War.
Can openers were needed because early cans were robust containers, which weighed more than food and required ingenuity to open, using whatever tools available. The instruction on those cans read "Cut round the top near the outer edge with a chisel and hammer."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.researchpod.co.uk/pdf/lifting_the_lid_on_the_tin_can_opener.pdf|title=Lifting the lid on the tin can opener|accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/canopener.htm|accessdate=2009-08-08|title=Can opener[/tpl] The bayonet part of Ezra Warner's can opener was pressed into the can, and a metal guard kept it from penetrating too far into the can. The other part was the sickle, which was forced into the can and sawed around the edge.Ezra J. Warner "Can opener" [tpl]US patent|19063[/tpl], January 5, 1858 However, Warner’s can opener was not a tool for domestic use, because it could be dangerous. Grocers opened the cans before they left the store. The first widespread domestic can opener was patented by William Lyman.

[[Texas Five]]
CATEGORIES: 2004 in American politics, 2003 Texas redistricting

The Texas Five was a term coined for a group of five Democratic members of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Texas. They were identified in this manner because the Congressional redistricting plan passed by the Texas legislature for the 2004 elections forced these five Democrats out of their previous districts and into ones dominated by Republicans and/or occupied by Republican incumbents. The five Democrats were Martin Frost, Charles Stenholm, Max Sandlin, Nick Lampson, and Chet Edwards. Four Democrats lost their bids for reelection. Only Edwards survived the redistricting, but was eventually defeated by a Republican in 2010. The races were especially notable for their extreme cost. Martin Frost's race against a Republican incumbent, Pete Sessions, was the most expensive U.S. House race in the 2004 elections. The four defeated Democrats had a combined 68 years of experience in the House of Representatives.

[[Ugayafukiaezu]]
CATEGORIES: Japanese gods, Shinto kami

[tpl]nihongo|Ugayafukiaezu-no-Mikoto|鵜葺草葺不合命|[/tpl], commonly shortened to Ugayafukiaezu, is a Japanese deity (kami) and in Japanese mythology, he is the father of Japan's (mythical) first emperor, Emperor Jimmu.  In Kojiki, his name appears as Amatsuhitaka-hiko'nakisatake-ugayafukiaezu-no-Mikoto (天津日高日子波限 建鵜草葦不合命), and in the Nihonshoki he is called Hiko'nagisatake-ugayafukiaezu-no-Mikoto (彦波瀲武鸕鶿草葺不合尊).
Ugayafukiaezu was a child of Hoori, a son of Ninigi-no-Mikoto, and Toyotama-hime, a daughter of Ryūjin. Though Toyotama-hime became pregnant at Ryūgū, the undersea palace, she opted not to bear the child in the ocean and decided to head to shore.  Both Hoori and Toyotama-hime attempted to build a house in which she could give birth, and attempted to construct the roof with feathers of cormorant instead of saw grass. However, while they were finishing the roof, she went into labor. So the child was named Ugayafukiaezu (lit. the roofing cormorant alternative to saw grass was not in time). 
While in labor, Toyotama-hime said to Hoori, "people in other countries change back to their original form when delivering a child. Because I think I too am changing back to my original form, do not look in the house no matter what, while I am delivering the child". However, Hoori looked in the house and saw Toyotama-hime in her original form of a shark, and he fled.  Feeling shamed, she returned to the sea, leaving her newborn child behind and sending her younger sister Tamayori-hime to raise the child in her place.  Another take on the legend states that feeling completely humiliated, she rushed back to the sea, dropping the child on the shore; the cries of the newborn infant reached Tamayori-hime's ears and she opted to raise the child instead.
Later, when Ugayafukiaezu reached adulthood, he married Tamayori-hime, and they had four children: Itsuse-no-Mikoto, Inahi-no-Mikoto, Mikenu-no-Mikoto, and Kan'yamato Iwarebiko. Mikenu traveled to Tokoyo (lit. "the normal world", though some texts hint that it is the afterworld), and Inahi went to the ocean to be with his mother.  Kan'yamato Iwarebiko, their youngest child, would later become Emperor Jimmu.

The Bishopric of Speyer (formerly known as Spires in English) was an ecclesiastical principality in what are today the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg. It was secularized in 1803. The prince-bishop resided in Speyer, a Free Imperial City, until the 14th century when he moved his residence to Uddenheim (Philippsburg), then in 1723 to Bruchsal, in large part due to the tense relationship between successive prince-bishops and the civic authorities of the Free City, officially Protestant since the Reformation. The prince-provostry of Wissemburg in Alsace was ruled by the prince-bishop of Speyer in a personal union relationship.Franck Lafarge, Les comtes Schönborn, 1642-1756, L'Harmattan, Paris, 2008, vol. 2, p. 349-350.

[[Gebrauchsmusik]]
CATEGORIES: German words and phrases, Musicology, Music education

Gebrauchsmusik ([tpl]IPA-de|ɡəˈbʁaʊ̯xsmuˌziːk[/tpl]) is a German term, essentially meaning “utility music,” for music that exists not only for its own sake, but which was composed for some specific, identifiable purpose. This purpose can be a particular historical event, like a political rally or a military ceremony, or it can be more general, as with music written to accompany dance, or music written for amateurs or students to perform.
While composer Paul Hindemith is probably the figure most identified with this expression, it seems to have been coined within the realm of musicology rather than composition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the modern academic discipline of musicology was formulated by a mainly German group of scholars who were interested not only in formal development and biographical data, but also to an extent in the sociopolitical position of music throughout history, and the relationship of music and musicians to society at large.

[[And Maggie Makes Three]]
CATEGORIES: The Simpsons (season 6) episodes, 1995 television episodes

"And Maggie Makes Three" is the thirteenth television episode of The Simpsons sixth season. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 22, 1995. In the episode, Lisa notices that there are no photos of Maggie in the family photo albums. This leads to a recount of Maggie's birth: having settled all his debts, Homer quit his job at the nuclear power plant, and took his dream job at a bowling alley. However, when Maggie was born, his salary was not enough to support three children, so he had to return to his old job at the plant. He explains that all of Maggie's pictures are at his work station to inspire him.
The episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden, and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. This was both Crittenden's and Scott's first episode on The Simpsons. It features cultural references to television shows such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Knight Rider. Since airing, the episode has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics, and has been called "a touching look at fatherhood" by Kevin Wong at PopMatters. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.3, and was the fourth highest rated show on Fox the week it aired.

[[Sanidine]]
CATEGORIES: Feldspar, Monoclinic minerals

Sanidine is the high temperature form of potassium feldspar (K,Na)(Si,Al)4O8. Sanidine most typically occurs in felsic volcanic rocks such as obsidian, rhyolite and trachyte. Sanidine crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. Orthoclase is a monoclinic polymorph stable at lower temperatures. At yet lower temperatures, microcline, a triclinic polymorph of potassium feldspar, is stable.
Due to the high temperature and rapid quenching, sanidine can contain more sodium in its structure than the two polymorphs that equilibrated at lower temperatures. Sanidine and high albite constitute a solid solution series with intermediate compositions termed anorthoclase. Exsolution of an albite phase does occur; resulting cryptoperthite can best be observed in electron microprobe images.

Quintus Cassius Longinus, the brother or cousin of Cassius (the murderer of Julius Caesar), was a governor in Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) for Caesar.
Cassius was one of the tresviri monetales of the Roman mint in 55 BC. He served as a quaestor of Pompey in Hispania Ulterior in 54 BC. In 49 BC, as tribune of the people, he strongly supported the cause of Caesar, by whom he was made governor of Hispania Ulterior. He treated the provincials with great cruelty, and his appointment (48 BC) to take the field against Juba I of Numidia gave him an excuse for fresh oppression. The result was an unsuccessful insurrection at Corduba. Cassius punished the leaders with merciless severity, and made the lot of the provincials harder than ever.
At last some of his troops revolted under the quaestor Marcellus, who was proclaimed governor of the province. Cassius was surrounded by Marcellus in Ulia. Bogud, king of Mauretania, and Marcus Lepidus, proconsul of Hispania Citerior, to whom Cassius had applied for assistance, negotiated an arrangement with Marcellus whereby Cassius was to be allowed to go free with the legions that remained loyal to him. Cassius sent his troops into winter quarters, hastened on board ship at Malaca with his ill-gotten gains, but was wrecked in a storm at the mouth of the Iberus (Ebro). His tyrannical government of Hispania greatly injured the cause of Caesar.

This is a list of British units in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) who fought against the American rebels and their French, Spanish and Dutch allies in the thirteen North American colonies, including battles in Florida and the West Indies. In addition to the regular army it includes German auxiliary units (known collectively as Hessians), and militia and provincial units formed from Loyalists, West Indians, and Canadians. 
No battle honours were ever awarded to British regiments who fought in America as it was seen by the British to be a civil war. Four battle honours were, however, awarded for actions against the French and Spanish in the West Indies and other theatres.
Only three British Army regiments (23rd Dragoons and the 73rd and 78th Foot) raised during the period of the war, many of whom were intended for North America, survived the post-war reduction in the Army. The 23rd Dragoons aka 19th Light Dragoons served in India; the 73rd (renumbered 71st in 1786) later became part of the Highland Light Infantry while the 78th (renumbered 72nd in 1786) became part of the Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-Shire Buffs) in 1881.
Note: An Infantry Unit not listed is the 2nd Regiment of Foot aka Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey); however the 1st Battalion -along with the Honourable Artillery Company-suppressed the Gordon Riots in London 1780. Neither did the 11th Regiment of Foot {Devonshire} nor the 12th Regiment of Foot {Suffolk}; nor the 25th Regiment of Foot aka King's Own Scottish Borderers at Sussex; nor the 32nd Regiment of Foot at Cornwall; the 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot at Herefordshire; nor the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot at East Middlesex nor 41st (Welsh) Regiment of Foot nor 51st (2nd Yorkshire West Riding) Regiment of Foot nor the 81st Regiment of Foot (Aberdeenshire Highland Regiment) take part in the American Revolution. The 86th Regiment of Foot (Rutland Regiment), the 87th Regiment of Foot, and the 90th Regiment of Foot (Yorkshire Volunteers) were stationed in the West Indies. The 72nd Highlanders; 83rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Glasgow Volunteers) and the 95th (Yorkshire) Regiment of Foot did take part in defeating a French invasion of Jersey in 1781 (the Battle of Jersey).

[[Buckskin (leather)]]

CATEGORIES: Hides, Deer hunting

Buckskin is the soft, pliable, porous preserved hide of an animal, usually deer, moose or elk  or even cowhide tanned to order, but potentially any animal's hide.  Modern leather labeled "buckskin" may be made of sheepskin tanned with modern chromate tanning chemicals and dyed to resemble real buckskin.  Leather is another product made from animal hide, but with a different chemical process to preserve the hide.  Buckskin is preserved with a dressing of some kind of lubricant, physically manipulated to make it soft and pliable, and usually smoked with woodsmoke. Smoking gives buckskin its typical dark honey color, and is highly recommended. Smoking prevents the tanned hide from becoming stiff if it gets wet, and deters insects from eating it as well. Unsmoked buckskin is lighter, even white, in color.  Coincidentally, the alkali soaking process is called bucking (from a Latin verb of the type *bucāre "to steep in lye, wash clothes");Oxford English Dictionary (OED), s.v. buck, v.1. buckskin itself is simply "the skin of a buck (deer)."OED, s.v. buckskin. Clothing made of buckskin is referred to as buckskins.
There are many ways to make buckskin, but most can probably be lumped into two categories:  "dry-scraping" and "wet-scraping". Before a hide can be tanned, any flesh remaining on the hide from the skinning process must be removed, usually with a scraper. Care must be taken when skinning, fleshing, and scraping a hide to prevent leaving any cuts or nicks in it which will be visible in the finished buckskin.

While working as an attaché he continued pursuing his passion for art. His first foray into the Singapore arts scene was with his first collection of poetry writing titled The Giant in 1968 and held his first art exhibition at the National Library on Stamford Road in 1973. He also converted to his faith to Buddhism in that year; his newfound spiritual experience outweighed his passion for the arts that made him give up painting for the next four years. It was only when the-then French Embassy cultural attaché Michel Deverge threatened to end their friendship if he didn't pursue his art again, that Tan resume painting.
