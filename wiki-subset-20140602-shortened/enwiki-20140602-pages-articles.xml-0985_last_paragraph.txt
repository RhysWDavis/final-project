[[List of sterile insect technique trials]]

CATEGORIES: Insect ecology

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an environmentally friendly method for the biological control of pests using area-wide inundative release of sterile insects to reduce reproduction in a field population of the same species (IPPC, 2007). SIT technique may be applied as part of an area-wide control (integrated pest management) approach of insects of medical, veterinary, and agricultural importance. It was in 1937 when Edward Knipling proposed using sterilization to control or eradicate insect pests after observation that screwworm fly males mate repeatedly while females mate only once. He then made the hypothesis that if large numbers of sterile males could repeatedly be released into wild populations, it would eventually eliminate population reproduction and lead to eradication.Knipling, E.F. 1955. Possibilities of insect control or eradication through the use of sexually sterile males. J. Econ. Entomol., 48: 459-462.Knipling, E.F. 1979.

[[Artificial rupture of membranes]]
CATEGORIES: Obstetrical procedures

Artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), also known as an amniotomy, may be performed by a midwife or obstetrician to induce or accelerate labor. The membranes may be ruptured using a specialized tool, such as an amnihook or amnicot, or they may be ruptured by the proceduralist's finger.  The different techniques for artificial rupture of membranes have not been extensively compared in the literature. In one study comparing amnihook versus amnicot for artificial rupture of membranes, use of an amnicot was associated with fewer neonatal scalp lacerations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Harris|first=M|author2=Cooper, EV|title=Amnihook versus amnicot for amniotomy in labour.|journal=Midwifery|date=December 1993|year=1993|volume=9|issue=4|pages=220–4|pmid=8283954[/tpl]
With the amnihook method, a sterile plastic hook is inserted into the vagina and used to puncture the membranes containing the amniotic fluid. With the membranes punctured, amniotic fluid is able to escape from the uterus and exit the vagina. The absence of a fluid buffer between the fetus and uterus stimulates uterine contractions, which are also promoted by the rush of prostaglandins from the amniotic fluid.

[[Claude Gouffier]]

CATEGORIES: 1510 births, 1570 deaths, French book and manuscript collectors

Claude Gouffier was a French nobleman and book collector. He was the model for the "Marquis de Carabas" from the story Puss in Boots by Charles Perrault.
He was the son of Artus Gouffier, tutor to the count of Angoulême who eventually rose to the throne as Francis I.Elton, Charles Isaac. The Great Book-Collectors, p.79 Under Francis I, the Gouffier family prospered and were important patrons of both art and literature. This important dynasty was seated at the estate of Château d'Oiron. Claude Gouffier was granted knighthood in 1533, and in 1546 created Marquis of Boissy and Caravaz.Hewitt, John and Alec Martin. A Pieta of Perugino, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 59, 1931 
He served at the Battle of Pavia, where he was one of the knights taken prisoner along with Francis I after the disastrous defeat of the French army. He was eventually released, but was captured again during a later French campaign in Italy by Ferrante Gonzaga in 1536. He was ransomed two years later by Francis for the huge sum of 6000 gold crowns in 1538.
Gouffier's official title was Grand Écuyer de France, or Master of the King's Stables, to Henri II, although his life's main vocation seems to have been the collection of books and unusual objects. He was said by Charles Isaac Elton to be "a collector of an essentially modern type. He bought autographs and historical portraits, as well as rare MSS. and good specimens of printing, and was careful to have his books well clothed in the fashionable painted binding."Elton, Charles Isaac. The Great Book-Collectors, p.79 
He was married five times. His first wife was Jacqueline de La Tremoille, who he wed in 1527. She attempted to murder him by poisoning, and was sentenced to prison (and her confessor, to death.) She died in 1544. His next wife was Françoise de Brosse de Britain, who died in childbirth in 1558, and the next was Mary Gaignon St. Bohaire who perished in 1565. In 1567 he married Claude de Beaune, who also died. His fifth marriage was in 1569, to Antoinette de La Tour-Landry, lady in waiting to Catherine de Medici.http://cahiersduvaldebargis.free.fr/claude_gouffier.htm
Like many other wealthy aristocrats of the Renaissance, Gouffier maintained a Wunderkammer or "Cabinet of Curiosities", which included an assortment of scientific and zoological artifacts. This has been expanded in the current day to include diverse works of art from all over the world. The original Wunderkammer collection is preserved to this day at the Château d'Oiron - and now includes a lifelike wax figure of Gouffier himself.http://oiron.monuments-nationaux.fr/en/

[[Research Institute for Advanced Studies]]

CATEGORIES: Research institutes in the United States, Mathematical institutes

The Baltimore-based Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS), not to be confused with the better-known Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, was among the several centers for research in the mathematical and physical sciences established throughout the United States after World War II, in recognition of the critical role that fundamental scientific research played in the outcome of that war. Although not as well known as other similar institutes, such as the IAS mentioned above, or the RAND Corporation, it nevertheless made significant contributions to the sciences of systems and control theory, and various branches of mathematics, during its 18-year existence.
The Research Institute for Advanced Studies (sometimes referred to in the singular) was founded in 1955 by George Bunker of the Glenn L. Martin Company, the ancestor of the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin. Its founding was the idea of George Bunker, who took over from Glenn Martin as chairman of that company in 1952. Like the leaders of other aircraft companies in the United States, Bunker recognized that the future of aviation lay in applying new ideas of fundamental research in mathematics, electronics, and physics that had been developed during World War II. Bunker established the Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, specifically chartered to support fundamental research. The RIAS's first Director was Welcome W. Bender.William B. Harwood, Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin-Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993), pp. 283-284.
The Institute distinguished itself as one of the world's leading centers of mathematical research, especially in control and systems theory. Among the mathematicians on its staff were Solomon Lefschetz and Rudolf E. Kálmán, who while at the Institute in 1960 published a famous paper that was the basis for the "Kalman Filter," a technique for extracting information from a noisy channel that finds applications in many facets of modern life.  While at RIAS in the early 1960s, Rodney Driver undertook research on delay differential equations and their applications.
The RIAS changed its name and turned its mission away from basic research in 1973, after the merger that produced the Martin Marietta Corporation.

Transient Songs is based in Seattle, Washington, and releases music on the boutique label Indian Casino Records.Ken Shimamoto, "South by Northwest", Ft.Worth Weekly, February 11, 2009.  Originally a duo with Andy Gassaway from Lawrence, Kansas on bass and slide guitar, the two released their first EP, Plantation to Your Youth in 2008 to acclaimed reviews. Many reviews noted similarities to early 1970s music such as the Byrds and Paisley Underground bands.  Reviews also noted the density of the music, akin to British rock fuzz forerunners The Jesus and Mary Chain.Matthew Tapia, "Test Spins: Plantation to your Youth", Plantation to your Youth Review, May 24, 2009. 
Prior to Transient Songs, Frum played in a myriad of obscure yet respected North Texas garage bands such as Grit and HassleHorse (An extensive history on this scene: Haltom City Nights: An Oral History was written by music journalist Ken Shimamoto in 2009).The Stash Dauber, "Haltom City Nights: An Oral History", Stashdauber: Rants of an unconstructed music geek, May 24, 2009.   Frum also served a stint for the Dallas punk rock band Hagfish before the band went on to greater notoriety.
In 2010 Frum released his first LP "Cave Syndrome".  The album brought more arrangements in the form of cello and violin and received strong reviews and was featured in Paste's "Best of What's Next" column.http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/best-of-whats-next-transient-songs.html
After the release of Cave Syndrome Frum ran into a previous an old friend who he had begun working on songs with prior to the release of Cave Syndrome, Michael Shunk and the two began working on material from the album and new songs.  In conjunction Frum began to enlist other band mates: Ian Pina on drums and Dayna Loeffler on bass and guitar switching instruments with band mate Andy Gassaway.  As the five piece began working on arrangements Gassaway departed for San Diego and Transient Songs began working on new material as a full band.  The band is currently working on the second Transient Songs full length slated for release in early 2012.

It lies about half way between the level crossing over the Hirtenweg path and the Ecker at a height of 1,011 metres above sea level. The rocks cannot be seen from the summit of the Brocken, the highest mountain in the Harz and the best view of them is from the village of Torfhaus. Because the rocks lie in the core zone of the Harz National Park, they may only be visited with the permission of the National Park management. It is one of the most difficult crags to reach in the High Harz. An old forest path runs past the rocks, passing within 100 metres.

[[Solanum aculeatissimum]]
CATEGORIES: Solanum

Solanum aculeatissimum, also known as the Indian Nightshade and Dutch eggplant,UNIPROT - Solanum aculeatissimum (Dutch eggplant) is a weedy shrub that bears small, 2-3 cm pale yellow fruit following white flowers with characteristic Solanum yellow stamens. Where S. aculeatissimum is native to has yet to be conclusively determined. Despite its common name suggesting a South-Asian origin, however, the plant's origin is most likely either Africa or South America; while specimens have been identified in Asia, it is rare there and believed to be the result of accidental or deliberate introduction. It is closely related to other Solanum species native to both sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. Africa was the first continent in which S. aculeastissium was documented.  Scottish-born botanist Francis Masson found the plant near the Cape of Good Hope either during the years 1772–1774, or during a subsequent expedition when he remained in southern Africa from 1786 until 1795. In South America, the plant was first described in 1816-1821 by Augustin Saint-Hilaire.Solanum aculeatissimum

Acceptance sampling  uses statistical sampling to determine whether to accept or reject a production lot of material.  It has been a common quality control technique used in industry. It is usually done as products leave the factory, or in some cases even within the factory. Most often a producer supplies a consumer a number of items and a decision to accept or reject the lot is made by determining the number of defective items in a sample from the lot. The lot is accepted if the number of defects falls below where the acceptance number or otherwise the lot is rejected.[tpl]cite book |title=Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 9th Edition |last=Kreyszig |first=Erwin  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-471-48885-9 |page= |pages=1248 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]

[[1994 State of the Union Address]]

CATEGORIES: Presidency of Bill Clinton, State of the Union addresses, 1994 in American politics

The 1994 State of the Union address was given by President Bill Clinton to a joint session of the 103rd United States Congress on January 25, 1994. The speech was Clinton's first official State of the Union address, although he had similarly addressed a joint session of Congress a year prior shortly after taking office.
The president discussed the federal budget deficit, taxes, defense spending, crime, foreign affairs, education, the economy, free trade, the role of government, campaign finance reform, welfare reform, and promoting the Clinton health care plan. President Clinton threatened to veto any legislation that did not guarantee every American private health insurance. He proposed for policies to fight crime: a three strikes law for repeat violent offenders; 100,000 more police officers on the streets; expand gun control to further prevent criminals from being armed and ban assault weapons; additional support for drug treatment and education.
The president began the speech with an acknowledgment of former Speaker Tip O'Neill, who died on January 5, 1994. While discussing additional community policing, the president honored Kevin Jett, a New York City cop attending the address who had been featured in a New York Times story in December 1993.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DF1338F931A25751C1A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=One Cop, Eight Square Blocks |last=Norman |first=Michael |date=December 12, 1993 |newspaper=New York Times[/tpl]

This had happened the previous year: in a speech Clinton gave to Congress on 22 September 1993 detailing the Clinton health care plan, the teleprompter was loaded with the wrong speech. Specifically, the one he gave to a joint session of Congress shortly after he was sworn-in in 1993.

[[Keaton Simons]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, American performance artists, 1978 births

Keaton Simons (born 20 July 1978) is a Los Angeles recording and performing artist.  He is signed to Best Revenge Records, his independent label created in 2012. Keaton's music has been featured on shows such as "Sons of Anarchy," "Hollywood Heights," "Private Practice," NCIS: Los Angeles, Crash, American Dad!, Harper's Island, and The Cleaner to name a few.
In the Spring of 2013, Keaton released his sophomore full-length album "Beautiful Pain," on Best Revenge Records. The album was co-produced with Mikal Blue (Colbie Caillat, One Republic) and mastered by Gavin Lurssen of Lurssen Mastering. It also includes co-writes with friends and peers Jason Mraz, Jason Reeves, Glen Phillips (Toad The Wet Sprocket) and Mikal Blue among others. With the exception of the drums, which are played by the United Nations’ Musical Director, Robin DiMaggio (Paul Simon, David Bowie, "Lopez Tonight"), all instruments on "Beautiful Pain" are played by Keaton. Additional featured artists on the record include Alex Al (bass), Lenny Castro (percussion), Zac Rae (keys), Tyler Hilton (piano, vocals), and Tower of Power’s Bill Churchville (trumpet, trombone) and Sean Hill (saxophone).
A regular in The Hotel Café singer/songwriter circuit, Keaton Simons has been recognized by Examiner.com as achieving “cult-like” status in his hometown of Los Angeles, CA. But as most know, Keaton is far from being just  an ”L.A. guy”  let alone a “new artist” on the mainstream map. His debut EP "Currently" was released on Maverick Records in 2004 and his debut full-length album "Can You Hear Me" was released on CBS Records in 2008. Since then, he has toured nationally and internationally, opening for Coldplay, Train, Guster and REO Speedwagon amongst others. He has also worked as a writer, musical director, singer, bassist and guitarist with such notable acts as Gnarls Barkley, Snoop Dogg, Josh Kelley and Tre Hardson (The Pharcyde.)
In 2011 Keaton appeared on VH1’s "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew" alongside stepfather, actor Eric Roberts, who was a patient. A performance of his song “Unstoppable” on the show resulted in over 10,000 iTunes downloads in only two days.
Keaton's multifaceted talents are not just in music, they have landed him appearances on television and film.  He has made guest appearances on shows such as The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Malcolm in the Middle, and American Dreams.  Keaton also appeared in the feature film Hollywood Dreams. He will make a cameo in the 2013 season finale of Showtimes's "Californication," on screen with David Duchovny and Maggie Grace.
Keaton currently lives in Venice Beach, CA with his girlfriend Laura Goldfarb, who is the owner of music public relations firm Red Boot PR as well as a DJ for the Internet station BreakThru Radio. Simons cites Goldfarb as the inspiration for his song and album title "Beautiful Pain," after they met each other at a music festival in upstate New York in 2009.

The Red Line is a rapid transit line in the MARTA rail system.  It operates between North Springs and Airport stations, running through Sandy Springs, Dunwoody, Atlanta, East Point and College Park.
The Red Line was originally called the North-South Line until MARTA switched to a color-based naming system in October 2009.  The North-South Line, from its launch, was considered one line (denoted with the Orange Line color on old system maps) until 2006 when the North Branch and the Northeast branch were redesignated as the North-South Line (the current Red Line) and the Northeast-South Line (the current Gold Line).
The rail line was part of the launch of MARTA north-south rail service in 1981.  The first segment ran from the Garnett to the North Avenue stations, although the Peachtree Center opened the year after as an infill.  In 1982, it expanded north to Arts Center, and in 1984, expanded as far north as Brookhaven and as far south as Lakewood/Fort McPherson.  The East Point station opened, extending the line two miles to the south.  A little more than a year later, the Chamblee station began service and served as the temporary terminus of the North Line.  In 1988, the Airport station opened, and became the terminus of the South Line.  In 1992, the North-South Line was extended northward to its current terminus at Doraville.  In 1998, MARTA extended North Line services to Dunwoody.  This created two branches of the North Line, and the Doraville branch was redesignated as the Northeast Line to avoid confusion.  It finally extended north to its current terminus at North Springs in 2000.
Now known as the Red Line, it shares trackage with its counterpart, the Gold Line, between Airport and just north of the Lindbergh Center.
After 9:00pm, Red Line shuttle train service operates between North Springs and Lindbergh Center stations only until the end of the service.

[[List of Washington Huskies in the NFL Draft]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of National Football League draftees by college football team, Washington Huskies football players, Washington (state) sports-related lists

The University of Washington Husky football team has had nearly 300 players drafted into the National Football League (NFL) since the league began holding drafts in 1936. Because of the NFL–AFL merger agreement, the history of the AFL is officially recognized by the NFL and therefore this list includes the AFL Draft (1960–1966) and the Common Draft (1967–1969).
Each NFL franchise seeks to add new players through the annual NFL Draft. Generally, the team with the worst record the previous year picks first, the next-worst team second, and so on. Teams that did not make the playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with any remaining ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff participants are sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).  See NFL Draft Rules for further detail.
Before the merger agreements in 1966, the American Football League (AFL) operated in direct competition with the NFL and held a separate draft. This led to a massive bidding war over top prospects between the two leagues. As part of the merger agreement on June 8, 1966, the two leagues would hold a multiple round "Common Draft". Once the AFL officially merged with the NFL in 1970, the "Common Draft" simply became the NFL Draft.

CATEGORIES: 1809 deaths, Executed American women, 19th-century executions of American people by hanging, People executed by Pennsylvania by hanging, People executed for murder, People from Berks County, Pennsylvania, 1785 births

Susanna Cox (1785–1809) was a young domestic servant in Berks County, Pennsylvania, accused of murdering her illegitimate infant son. Berks County was home to large populations of German-language immigrants who settled there in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Cox shared this German heritage (referred to as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch). Cox was an uneducated woman who spoke a German dialect and could do little to defend herself in court.
Furthermore, she was tried at a time when American laws were changing. After a brief trial, Cox was hanged in Reading, Pennsylvania, on June 10, 1809. Following her execution, her story gained such sympathy that it was written in a ballad and widely circulated in German and in English through newspapers and broadsides. This immensely popular ballad was printed in over 88 editions in its broadside form throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today, the ballad is read at the annual summer Kutztown Folk Festival to audiences who listen intently and then witness an effigy of Cox hanged in a dramatic reenactment.

Antonín Bečvář ([tpl]IPA-cs|ˈantoɲiːn ˈbɛtʃvaːr̝̊[/tpl]; 10 June 1901 – 10 January 1965) was a Czech astronomer who was active in Slovakia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Obituary: Antonín Bečvář|journal=Physics Today|date=September 1965|volume=18|issue=9|pages=113|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v18/i9/p113_s3?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3047707[/tpl] He was born (and died) in Stará Boleslav. Among his chief achievements is the foundation of the Skalnaté Pleso Observatory and the discovery of the comet C/1947 F2 (Bečvář) (also known by the designations 1947 III and 1947c).  His lifelong illness led him to the High Tatras where he founded the observatory.[tpl]cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Publishing |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58133.html[/tpl]  
Bečvář is particularly important for his star charts: he led the compilation of the Atlas Coeli Skalnate Pleso (1951), published by Sky Publishing Corporation as the Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens, which was the state-of-the-art atlas of its kind until Wil Tirion's "Sky Atlas 2000.0" in 1981. He also compiled Atlas eclipticalis, 1950.0 (1958), Atlas borealis 1950.0 (1962), and Atlas australis 1950.0 (1964).
The asteroid 4567 Bečvář and the crater Bečvář on the Moon were named in his honour. American Avant-garde composer John Cage used Bečvář's star charts as the basis of several works: Atlas Eclipticalis (1961–62), Etudes Australes (1974–75), Etudes Boreales (1978) and Freeman Etudes (1977–80, 1989–90).

[[Land of Unlikeness]]
CATEGORIES: Works by Robert Lowell, 1944 books, Poetry collections

Land of Unlikeness, Robert Lowell's first book of poetry, was published in 1944 in a limited edition of two hundred and fifty copies by Harry Duncan at the Cummington Press. The poems were all metered, often rhymed, and very much informed by Lowell's recent conversion to Catholicism. 
The book contains an insightful introduction by Lowell's one-time teacher and mentor Allen Tate who labels the young Lowell "a Catholic poet." In describing the prevailing style of the book, Tate writes,"it is bold and powerful, and the symbolic language often has the effect of being willed; for it is an intellectual style compounded of brilliant puns and shifts of tone; and the willed effect is strengthened by the formal stanzas, to which the language is forced to conform." While not a glowing assessment of Lowell's early work, Tate does conclude that Lowell is an important young poet who "will have to be reckoned with." Tate also states that he prefers the poems in Land of Unlikeness which are less "explicitly religious," citing the poems "A Suicidal Nightmare" and "Death from Cancer." 
Five poems from this volume were republished in Lowell's next book, Lord Weary's Castle. Although the book is not particularly well known and was soon completely overshadowed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lord Weary's Castle, the full text of Land of Unlikeness, which had been out of print for many years, was reprinted in 2003 in the Appendices Section of Lowell's Collected Poems. The editor of the Collected Poems, Frank Bidart, notes in his "Introduction" to the volume that, during his lifetime, Lowell would not allow Land of Unlikeness to be reprinted, and Bidart states that he thought Lord Weary's Castle was "the book that Land of Unlikeness wanted to be."

[[Introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales]]
CATEGORIES: Rugby union in Wales

The introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales occurred prior to the start of the 2003/04 rugby union season. From this date, Wales was represented by a smaller number of regional teams in both the Celtic League and European Cup competitions, where previously the top club sides were entered into them.
The introduction followed much controversy, as clubs disagreed with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), the governing body of the sport in Wales, over many issues, including the forming of partnerships, funding levels, loss of status and both the number and locations of regional teams.

IsiNgqumo developed during the 1980s.http://www.sephis.org/pdf/epprecht.pdf, page 1, paragraph 3 Unlike Gayle IsiNgqumo has not been thoroughly researched or documented, so figures on numbers of speakers are nonexistent.
IsiNgqumo is a Nguni language and seems to have derived from Zulu.http://www.sephis.org/pdf/epprecht.pdf, page 5, paragraph 3 IsiNgqumo is often considered a Western invention by indigenous Zimbabweans but it was actually a creation of indigenous homosexuals, an only recently self-aware group.

Rudolf Wissell (9 March 1869 - 13 December 1962) was a German politician in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). During the Weimar Republic, he held office as the Minister for Economics and the Minister for Labour.
Wissell was born in Göttingen, Province of Hanover.  He was a member of the SPD from 1888, and belonged to the right wing of the party. From 1908, Wissell was a member of the central workers' secretariat of trade unions in Berlin. From 1916 he worked part-time in the SPD newspaper Vorwärts.
In March 1918, Wissel was elected to the Reichstag for the electoral district "Potsdam 6"; he remained a member of the Reichstag until the collapse of the monarchy in November of that year. On 28 December 1918 Wissell was called to join the Council of the People's Deputies, along with Gustav Noske. The appointments came about after the three representatives of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) had withdrawn from the Council. This opened an opportunity for the SPD to send more delegates to the Council. During the revolution, as Second Chairman of the General Commission of Trade Unions, Wissell also called for an arrangement with employers, and opposed the formation of a Soviet republic. One result of his arguments was the conclusion of the Stinnes-Legien Agreement, which meant that the employer's associations for the first time recognised the trade unions as the representatives of the workers.

Sophia Magdalena Krag Juel Vind (1734–1810), was a Danish Salon holder, landowner and noble. She is considered to have exerted considerable political influence in Danish politics during the late 18th century.  
Daughter of Carl Christian von Gram (1703–80) and Birgitte Christine Friis (1715–75) and in 1752 married to landowner Baron Jens Krag-Juel Vind (1724–1776). She belonged to the elite of the aristocraty and received the L’union parfaite in 1757. Nothing is known of her life prior to 1776. As a widow, she became the richest landowner of her country, and her house in Copenhagen became the center of the capitals aristocracy. During the 1780s and 1790s, she was the "hostess" of the “danske parti” (The Danish party) which opposed the ruling “tyske parti” (German party) who ruled Denmark from 1784, and she was in opposition to A.P. Bernstorff, Christian Ditlev, Ludvig Reventlow and Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann and was regarded a powerful enemy of the Reventlow family. In 1790, she was the instigator of proprietærfejde; the Jutian nobilitys opposition movement to the new country labour reforms, whose meetings took place at her estate Stensballegård; with her connections, she was a real treath to the ruling government.    
In 1799, she inherited the county of Frijsenborg after her aunt Elisabeth Sophie Desmercières.

[[Blue Line (MARTA)]]
CATEGORIES: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Railway lines opened in 1979

The Blue Line is a rapid transit line in the MARTA rail system.  It operates between Hamilton E. Holmes  and Indian Creek stations, running through Atlanta, Decatur and portions of unincorporated DeKalb County.
The Blue Line was previously called the East-West Line until MARTA switched to a color-based naming system in October 2009.  The East-West Line, from its launch, was considered one line (denoted with the Blue Line color on old system maps) until 2006 when the West branch and the Proctor Creek branch were redesignated as the East-West Line (the current Blue Line) and the Proctor Creek Line (the current Green Line).
The rail line was part of the initial launch of MARTA rail service in 1979.  The first segment ran from the East Line segment from Georgia State to the Avondale stations upon the opening in June of that year.  By the end of 1979, it extended west to the Hightower station (now Hamilton E. Holmes) on the West Line segment, which serves as that station's terminus.  Although the North-South line was expanded throughout the 1980s, the East-West line did not see any extension since its opening until 1992 when the Proctor Creek branch of the line opened to its terminus at Bankhead station.  It finally extended to its current eastern terminus at Indian Creek in September 1993.
Now known as the Blue Line, it shares trackage with its counterpart, the Green Line, between just west of Ashby and Edgewood/Candler Park.

[[List of early color feature films]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of films by technology

This is a list of early color feature length films from 1903-1935, when the Technicolor three-strip process ("Process 4") was introduced. On the list below, all movies prior to The Show of Shows (1929) are silent films. About 36 percent of the movies on this list are thought to be lost films, with no prints surviving, or with only partial prints surviving. (This does not include movies that now exist only in black-and-white prints.)
The earliest attempts to produce color films involved hand-painting the negative or tinting it with dye. Stencil-based techniques such as Pathéchrome and the Handschiegl color process were an extension of this. Several dyes were rolled over the negative, each with an appropriate stencil underneath to restrict the dye to the desired parts of the print. Since transparent dye preserved the varying brightness of the black and white image, the result could look rather naturalistic, but in fact the choice of what colors to use and where was made by a person. Kinemacolor was the first process to capture natural color on film stock.

[[Wastelands Ordinance]]
CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Land use

The Cultivation of Wastelands Ordinance, also known as a Wastelands Ordinance, is an ordinanceAlan Dowty, Critical issues in Israeli society (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), p.113 that presumes that, in a given area, there exists the problem referred to as a tragedy of the commons. This phrase has been most frequently used by nobles hoping to be able to convince the population that it would be better for a local economy if they were allowed to lay claim to a given piece of land (for private use),Boyle, J. (2003) "The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain", Law and Contemporary Problems, Vol. 66, Issue 33, pp. 34-36. thereby implying that this would "correct" the situation, making the land thus claimed yield more produce. From roughly 1982 onward, however, a body of research has been emerging that suggests that the claimed productivity gains were mostly imaginary, and the only effect it had was that it enriched the new land-owners.Robert C. Allen, "The Efficiency and Distributional Consequences of Eighteenth Century Enclosures," 92 ECON. J. 937 (1982) This was argued to apply even more to lands under cultivation by so-called 'native populations', and as such this ordinance was invented to allow the colonial power to 'legally' annex the land.
Historically, the wastelands ordinance has most often been used to claim lands from natives, for use by a colonial or occupying power, most notably the British in Sri Lanka.

Maryland Route 246 (MD 246) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.

In conjunction with MD 5, MD 246 connects NAS Patuxent River and the suburban area surrounding the military base with Leonardtown.  The state highway was originally constructed around 1920.  MD 246 extended east onto land now occupied by NAS Patuxent River to serve a ferry from St. Mary's County to the southern end of Calvert County.  The ferry was discontinued and the state highway's eastern terminus was rolled back to MD 235 when NAS Patuxent River was constructed during World War II; the remainder of MD 246 was upgraded as a military access project.  MD 246 was expanded to a multi-lane highway in the 1990s.

Bedford Abbey was a short-lived Benedictine monastery, recorded in 10th century England. Bedford Priory, perhaps representing the same institution two centuries later, was an Augustinian priory that within two decades of its foundation moved to nearby Newnham.
Bedford Abbey existed in the 10th-century, staffed with Benedictine monks when Oscytel, Archbishop of York, died in 971.http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=360190&sort=1&type=&class1=Religion&period=None&county=Bedfordshire&place=&yearfrom=ALL&yearto=ALL&recordsperpage=30&source=text&p=1Knowles and Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 30; Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, p. 147  The archbishop was buried in the abbey, after his body was taken there by its abbot, Thurcytel (who later moved to Crowland Abbey).Knowles and Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 30; Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, pp. 147, 420 Thurcytel is the only known abbot of the monastery.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, p. 30 Its history after this is obscure, and may have evolved into St Pauls, which became an Augustinian priory c. 1166.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, p. 30, n. 1; Knowles and Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses,  pp. 147, 420 Around 1180, the priory moved to Newnham (see Newnham Priory).Knowles and Hadcock, Medieval Religious Houses,  p. 147

[[Succussion splash]]
CATEGORIES: Audible medical signs

Succussion splash is a sloshing sound heard through the stethoscope during sudden movement of the patient on abdominal auscultation. It reflects the presence of gas and fluid in an obstructed organ, as in gastric outlet obstruction.
Physical examination can show an abdominal succussion splash, which is elicited by placing the stethoscope over the upper abdomen and rocking the patient back and forth at the hips. Retained gastric material up to three hours after a meal will generate a splash sound and indicate the presence of a hollow viscus filled with both fluid and gas.
An example would be a gastric outflow obstruction with abdominal succussion splash.Valle JD. Chapter 293. Peptic Ulcer Disease and Related Disorders.

The McCullough Report is a report published by the Irish Roman Catholic bishops in June 2005 following allegations of homosexual sexual abuse between seminarians and staff at St Patrick's College, Maynooth in Ireland. The report looked at how the College responded to the allegations, and found that no specific allegations of sexual abuse had been made. Instead it found that the allegations were focused on the alleged lifestyle and possible "homosexual tendencies" of Micheál Ledwith, at the time Vice-President of the college, and that the Dean of the college, Gerard McGinnity, had expressed non-specific concerns about possible improprieties in Ledwith's relationship with some students. Although the report did not find that there were allegations of sexual harassment made against Ledwith, it did find that the concerns raised by McGinnity were not adequately investigated.

Burma held its third general election on 6 February 1960 to decide which faction of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) should take over from General Ne Win's interim administration, established in October 1958. The military-led administration was credited for bringing stability and improving infrastructure in the country, though it suppressed some civil liberties.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bigelow|first=Lee S|year=1960|journal=Far Eastern Survey|publisher=Institute of Pacific Relations|volume=29|issue=5|pages=70–74|title=The 1960 Elections in Burma|jstor=3024046[/tpl]
The election was seen as not so much a contest between former Premier U Nu and associates against former colleagues U Kyaw Nyein and U Ba Swe, but a referendum on the policies of the interim military government between 1958 and 1960.[tpl]cite book|last=Rotberg|first=Robert I|title=Burma: prospects for a democratic future|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=1998|page=43|isbn=978-0-8157-7581-2[/tpl] The "Clean AFPFL" faction led by former Premier U Nu won the election with a majority of seats. The communist-orientated National United Front (NUF) won no seats, compared to the 1956 election.
The election set a precedent to other Middle Eastern and South Asian leaders, where the military voluntary handed over to a civilian government and held free elections.[tpl]cite journal|last=Butwell|first=Richard|coauthors=von der Mehden, Fred|year=1960|title=The 1960 Election in Burma|journal=Pacific Affairs|publisher=Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia|volume=33|issue=2|pages=144–157|jstor=2752941[/tpl] However, two years after his election victory, Nu was overthrown by a coup d'état led by General Ne Win on 2 March 1962.

The [tpl]convert|122797|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] wilderness with [tpl]convert|164|mi|km[/tpl] of trails was established in 1980.

The Holy Cross Wilderness has a history of many hikers, often those who are unprepared, becoming endangered.  Primarily, the hikers who require rescue are unfamiliar with the risks of entering wilderness areas and do not bring adequate equipment and supplies to respond to emergency conditions.  Hikers are frequently stranded or lost due to changing environmental conditions and confusion regarding the surrounding landscape.  Holy Cross Wilderness visitors should carry adequate provisions, the ten essentials, including water, food, firestarter, guide book or map, global positioning device, layers of clothing, headlamp, knife, and cell telephone.  Thorough research and reasonable planning should prevent most tragedies.[tpl]cite newspaper |title=Search called off for missing hiker in rugged Holy Cross Wilderness |publisher=The Denver Post |date=October 15, 2010 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16343363%7Ctitle= |accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Lynn |first=Steve |title=Lost hiker braves wind, cold in cave |publisher=Summit Daily |date=August 2, 2007 |url=http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20070802/NEWS/70802004&parentprofile=search%7Ctitle= |accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl]

The fishes of Yellowstone National Park, in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming (U.S.), include 13 native fish species and six introduced or non-native species.  Angling for trout has been a pastime in the park since its creation and trout species dominate the fish inhabiting the park. When Yellowstone National Park was created in 1872, 40% of the park's waters were barren of fish, including most alpine lakes and rivers above major waterfalls.  Only 17 of 150 lakes held fish.[tpl]cite journal |last=Franke |first=Mary Ann |title=A Grand Experiment-100 Years of Fisheries Management in Yellowstone: Part I |journal=Yellowstone Science |publisher=Yellowstone Center for Resources, National Park Service |volume=4 |number=4 |date=Fall 1996[/tpl]
In 1889 the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries began a 60-year program of stocking and hatchery operations that significantly altered the ranges of native and non-native species within the park. By 1955, all stocking and hatchery operations in the park had been stopped. Several introduced species never established viable populations, and at least one introduced species was successfully eradicated from the park.

CATEGORIES: 1822 births, Scottish explorers, 1900 deaths

Dr. Peter Cormac Sutherland (1822 - 30 November 1900) Born in Newlands of Forse, near Latheron, Caithness, Scotland. The son of Robert and Elizabeth Sutherland, he was one of three surviving children of a family of eight, due to Smallpox and a drowning accident in Nova Scotia. He became a Geologist, Physician and an Author.
In 1850 he embarked on a campaign to discover the fate of the HMS Erebus and Terror after a disastrous Polar expedition. It was on that expedition that he sailed under the command of Mr William Penny R.N. onboard HMS Lady Franklin and Sophia and from which his book "Journal of a voyage in Baffin's Bay and Barrow Straits" originated. The campaign was largely a success as they discovered the fate of several crew members of the polar expedition buried at the winter base station.
Dr. Sutherland later moved with his wife and two children to Pietermaritzburg, where he later became Surveyor-General of Natal, South Africa, succeeding William Stanger. It was while Dr Sutherland held this position that his friend, the father of Cecil Rhodes requested that Cecil reside with him temporarily.
Dr Sutherland was killed in a road accident on 30 Nov 1900 in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.

[[Drop table]]
CATEGORIES: Rail technologies, Maintenance of way equipment

A drop table or wheel drop is a device used in railway engineering during maintenance jobs that require the removal of  locomotive or rolling stock wheelsets.[tpl]cite book|title=The Century dictionary and cyclopedia; a work of universal reference in all departments of knowledge|publisher=The Century Co|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924091890602#page/n13/mode/1up[/tpl] The machine is built in a drop pit allowing a locomotive or rolling stock to be rolled onto it, avoiding the need for heavy cranes or jacks to lift the vehicle off the rails. 
The vehicle is placed over the drop table, and the connections attaching the wheelset to the vehicle are unfastened. This allows the wheel set to 'float' independently of the locomotive. The wheelset is lowered into the drop pit on a short section of rail, and a dummy rail, normally a part of the drop table machinery, is then inserted in the gap over the lowered wheelset. This enables the vehicle to be moved clear of the drop table on its remaining wheels, so that the removed wheelset can then be lifted out of the drop pit for maintenance work to be performed on it.

Hokkaidō 9th district is a constituency of the House of Representatives in the Diet of Japan (national legislature). It consists of Hokkaido's Hidaka and Iburi Subprefectures. As of 2009, 414,438 eligible voters were registered in the district.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC): 平成21年9月2日現在における選挙人名簿及び在外選挙人名簿登録者数 [tpl]ja[/tpl]
Hokkaido 9th district, like neighbouring 8th and 10th district, was considered a "Democratic kingdom" (minshu-ōkoku), a stronghold of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). From its creation in 1996 until 2012 it had been represented by DPJ co-founder Yukio Hatoyama. In 2012, Hatoyama retired. The LDP had nominated Hokkaidō prefectural assemblyman and former Olympic speed skater Manabu Horii as their candidate in July 2012.The Japan Times, July 5, 2012: Hatoyama could face tough re-election bid against Horii
In the 2000, 2003 and 2005 general elections, the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate was Hirofumi Iwakura, later mayor of Tomakomai, Iburi Subprefecture. In 2000, Iwakura lost the district to Hatoyama by a margin of less than 3,000 votes.
Before the 1994 electoral reform, the area had been part of Hokkaido 4th district where five representatives were elected by single non-transferable vote. Yukio Hatoyama (New Party Sakigake), Tatsuo Takahashi (LDP) and Tomoko Kami (JCP) had already stood as candidates there in 1993.

[[Gehyra oceanica]]
CATEGORIES: Geckos

The Oceanic Gecko, Gehyra oceanica, is a species of gecko in the genus Gehyra. It is also known as the Pacific Dtella or the Big Tree Gecko. The larger Gehyra vorax (voracious gecko) of Fiji, Vanuatu and New Guinea has sometimes been included in this species, but is now treated as distinct.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.2307/1446204|last=Beckon|first=William N.|year=1992|title=The Giant Pacific Geckos of the Genus Gehyra: Morphological Variation, Distribution, and Biogeography |journal=Copeia| volume=1992 |issue=2| pages=443–460 | jstor = 1446204[/tpl]
The species is native to New Guinea and a number of islands in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. It has also been widely introduced across the islands of the Pacific, reaching as far as the Marquesas Islands in Polynesia (where the species was first collected  for science), although the extent to which the species has been introduced by human intervention is a matter of some debate. There are two apparent populations, a northern one in Micronesia and a southern one in Melanesia and Polynesia.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.2307/2411165 |last=Fisher |first=Robert N.|title=Dispersal and Evolution of the Pacific Basin Gekkonid Lizards Gehyra oceanica and Gehyra mutilata |journal = Evolution |year=1997 |volume=51 |issue=3| pages=906–921 | jstor = 2411165[/tpl] There are also records of the species in New Zealand and Hawaii, but the species has apparently not become established there.
The species is generally arboreal and nocturnal. The diet includes insects and even smaller geckos. Some stomachs have also been found with seeds from fruit. It reproduces sexually, and unlike some other geckos in its genus its eggs are non-adhesive. The species shares communal nests of not more than twelve eggs in each, with only two eggs being laid by a female at a time. These eggs have a long incubation time, up to 115 days. It inhabits a range of habitats including plantations, gardens, and disturbed and undisturbed forests.[tpl]cite book |last=Lever |first=Christopher |title=Naturalized reptiles and amphibians of the world|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|series=Oxford biology readers|pages=65–66 |isbn=978-0-19-850771-0 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=igNPuKzHfG0C&pg=PA65 [/tpl] The species will also feed inside human buildings, but is not described as commensal.

As of September 2012, 237,748 eligible voters were registered in the district.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC): 平成24年9月2日現在選挙人名簿及び在外選挙人名簿登録者数>選挙区ごとの選挙人名簿及び在外選挙人名簿登録者数等 [tpl]ja[/tpl]
Saga 1st district has been a swing district since its creation in 1996: it alternately elected candidates for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)/its precursor New Frontier Party (NFP). The district is currently represented by Kazuchika Iwata (LDP), a former second-generation Saga prefectural assemblyman. In 2012, Iwata defeated Kazuhiro Haraguchi (DPJ), Minister of Internal Affairs and Communication in the Hatoyama cabinet. Haraguchi had initially won the district narrowly for the NFP in 1996 but lost it in 2000 to Takanori Sakai (LDP) who was appointed as Cabinet Office Vice Minister in the 2nd realigned Mori cabinet. In March 2003, Sakai was arrested (and later sentenced to 32 months in prison) for having received illicit corporate donations in violation of the Political Funds Control Law.The Japan Times, June 27, 2003: Sakai, cohort plead not guilty to defrauding stateThe Japan Times, March 23, 2007: Prosecutors drive ex-labor minister to penitentiary Takamaro Fukuoka replaced Sakai as LDP candidate for Saga 1 in the 2003 election and lost to Haraguchi. The "postal privatization" election of 2005 gave the LDP a landslide victory, and Fukuoka beat Haraguchi despite the fact that the DPJ's opposition ally, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), unlike in previous elections did not nominate a candidate in Saga 1st district. In the landslide LDP defeat of 2009, Haraguchi won the district for the third time.
Before the 1994 electoral reform, the area had been part of Saga At-large district where five representatives were elected by single non-transferable vote.

Indract or Indracht was a saint who, along with his companions, was venerated at Glastonbury Abbey, a monastery in the county of Somerset in south-western England. In the High Middle Ages Glastonbury tradition held that he had been an Irish pilgrim — a king's son – on his way back from Rome who was molested and killed by a local thegn after he had stopped off to visit the shrine of St Patrick. This tradition synchronised his life with that of King Ine (688–726), though historian Michael Lapidge has argued that he is most likely to represent a 9th-century abbot of Iona named Indrechtach ua Fínnachta.
The cult seems to date from the late 10th or early 11th century, though this is uncertain. There is one main extant account, the anonymous 12th century Passio sancti Indracti. An earlier text written in Old English is said to have existed and been used by the writer of the Passio. There is also evidence that the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury wrote his own saint's life, and although now lost it may also have used the Old English text. In the 14th century a St Alban's monk added significant new material of probable Cornish origin, mentioning a sister named Dominica and some miracles.

Ivan Medek (July 13, 1925 – January 6, 2010) was a Czech classical music critic, radio broadcaster and journalist.  Medek was an important voice of the Czech anti-communist opposition movement, particularly after being forced into exile from Czechoslovakia in 1978.[tpl]cite news |first=|last=|title=Former Czech Chancellor Ivan Medek Dies at 84 |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2010713861_apeuczechobitmedek.html|work=Associated Press |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2013-12-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Johnstone |title=Legendary Czech broadcaster Ivan Medek remembered |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/123819 |work=Radio Praha |publisher= |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-01-07[/tpl] Medek collaborated closely with such Czechoslovak politicians as Václav Havel and Pavel Tigrid in opposition to communist rule.
Medek was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on July 13, 1925. He began his career as both a classical music critic and journalist.  He worked as a musician for the Czech Philharmonic until he was fired by the government for his support of the opposition.
Medek was an original signatory of the Charter 77 manifesto in 1977.  Persecution by the communist government for his participation in Charter 77 forced Medek into exile in neighboring Austria beginning in 1978. Medek began working at the Voice of America in Austria, where he broadcast news and information into Czechoslovakia. His VoA radio broadcasts became an important link for anti-communist dissidents in his native Czechoslovakia.
Medek returned to Czechoslovakia from exile in 1989 during the Velvet Revolution. In 1993, Medek was appointed to the office of the presidency under Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic. He later became the head of the presidency, or chancellor, under Havel.
Medek died in Prague on January 6, 2010, at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife, Helena.

The Panama held a general election on 27 May 1948, electing both a new President of the Republic and a new National Assembly.
"For the 1948 campaign the reigning Liberal Doctrinaire Party chose 73-year-old Domingo Díaz Arosemena as its candidate. Arnulfo Arias Madrid rose from the political dead, dusted off his ‘panameñismo’ nationalism, and in an initial count by the National Elections Board apparently won the presidency by 1500 votes. Díaz supporters thereupon attacked the Board. At this point José Antonio Remón Cantera, head of the National Guard, took charge. Under his protection the Elections Board magically made enough of Arias’s votes disappear so Díaz became President".

The Papuan Volunteer Corps (PVK, Dutch: Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps) was a corps consisting entirely of Papuans, formed on February 21, 1961.  It was established to contribute to the defense of Dutch New Guinea against the infiltration of the Indonesian Army. The establishment of the Corps by the Dutch Cabinet was approved in December 1959, and the corps was to serve as a semi-military police. 
The PVK was composed of different peoples of Papua, and was under command of colonel of marines W.A. van Heuven. As an emblem the PVK chose the Cassowary (kasuaris in Dutch): the Corp's motto was Persevero (I persist).  The PVK was armed and was equipped with a khaki uniform and a hat with the left edge upward, which was adorned with the PVK emblem and a plume. 
In 1961–1962, the Indonesian threat greatly expanded. After the administration of the territory was passed to the United Nations (UNTEA) and the subsequent Indonesian government (1962–1963), the PVK was dissolved, and the members were dismissed. Some members later joined the Indonesian Army. Others, including Sergeant Awom Ferry, founded a guerrilla army, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), and began a struggle for independence from Indonesia.

[[Blue Pear Records]]
CATEGORIES: American record labels

Blue Pear Records was a semi-fictitious record label based in Longwood, Florida, which is best known for re-issuing rare cast recordings of obscure Broadway and off-Broadway musicals in the mid-1980s.  The lack of production credits and other helpful identifying information on the LP sleeves has generally led to the assumption that they are bootleg recordings.

[[Monroe Transit]]
CATEGORIES: Bus transportation in Louisiana, Transit agencies in Louisiana

Monroe Transit is the operator of public transportation in metropolitan Monroe, Louisiana. Since 1906, Monroe Transit, the nation's oldest publicly owned transportation system, has been continuously owned and operated by the City of Monroe. Over 100 years after its inception, Monroe Transit remains the public transportation provider to the City, offering twenty (20) regularly scheduled routes, as well as, paratransit services to the community.
Monroe Transit has a long, rich history. In 1903, at the urging of Mayor A.A. Forsythe, the Monroe City Council voted to begin the first municipal railroad in the United States. The city awarded a $100,000 contract to the Westinghouse Electrical Co. in 1904 to build the city-owned street railway. Construction began in May 1905 but was later delayed due to a Yellow Fever epidemic.
On June 11, 1906 Mayor Forsythe, city officials, and prominent Monroe residents made the first official run of the Monroe Municipal Street Railway. Revenue service on the four lines began June 15, 1906. By this time, West Seattle, WA had already begun the first municipally owned street railway, making Monroe the second in the U.S. to introduce this new model of public transportation.
The street railway continued to operate until 1938. Although many extensions were made to the railway throughout its operation, Monroe was expanding, making buses a more economical and practical option. The final streetcar ran down the Lee Avenue line on August 21, 1938 and the evolution of Monroe Transit as the modern transportation system we know today had officially begun.
In 2005, night service was also instituted and hours for regular routes were extended.  Service is not currently provided on Sundays.

[[Lamb (rock band)]]
CATEGORIES: American rock music groups, Musical groups from San Francisco, California, Musical groups established in 1969, 1969 establishments in California

Lamb was a San Francisco-based rock group.KRON-TV newsfilm from September 1968 featuring brief views of Lamb performing live onstage, in San Francisco: https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/209218.  They tend to be remembered only for their appearance on the Fillmore: The Last Days concert album, where they were one of several non-star artists on a set dominated by bigger names like the Grateful Dead, Santana, and Jefferson Airplane. They also played at the The Ribeltad Vorden in San Francisco.  However, they did issue three albums: A Sign of Change (Fillmore, 1970), Cross Between (War. Bros., 1971) and Bring Out The Sun (War. Bros., 1971 - Billed as:  Barbara Mauritz & Lamb). 
Lamb were formed by the duo of Texan singer Barbara Mauritz and (multi-instrumentalist though primarily guitarist) Bob Swanson, who with Mauritz (writing both separately and together) were responsible for the band's material.
Their music blended jazz, folk music, singer-songwriter pop, gospel, and even some classical and avant-garde influences. Reminiscent in spots of such varied artists as Tim Buckley, Judy Collins (in her art-song phase), David Ackles, and Savage Rose (in that band's most gospel-soaked period), their records were ultimately idiosyncratic enough to defy ready comparison to anyone. 
Their debut album on the Fillmore label, A Sign of Change, was perhaps their most uncompromising and experimental, relying largely on jazz-folk acoustic arrangements and spotlighting Mauritz's impressive voice on impressionistic, dream-like lyrics.

Allmusic wrote: "Lamb's second album used some far more conventional elements of electric rock production than their starker debut had, which in some ways made this follow-up more mainstream and less striking. On the other hand, the songs themselves were more eclectic, and complemented well by the greater textural depth of the arrangements. Most importantly, the songwriting continued to be as inspired and unusual as it had been on A Sign of Change, and only slightly less abstract, again mixing jazz, folk, impressionistic singer/songwriter rock, gospel, and classical, though in different proportions."

CATEGORIES: 1893 births, 1918 deaths, French World War I flying aces

Lieutenant Jean Chaput was a World War I flying ace credited with 16 aerial victories. He served in the army infantry beginning in 1913. He transferred to aviation in 1914. He qualified as a pilot by February 1915, was assigned to Escadrille 28, and scored his first victory on 12 June 1915 while piloting a Caudron. He was awarded the Medaille Militaire for this action. Three days later, he was wounded. On 10 July, he suffered the first of two serious wounds that would cause lengthy interruptions in his flying career. He did not return to duty until January 1916.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/france/chaput.php Retrieved 7 January 2010. Having risen through the enlisted ranks to sergeant, he was now commissioned a lieutenant in March 1916.[tpl]cite book |title=Nieuport Aces of World War 1 |pages= 52–53 [/tpl] He scored twice more, on 18 March and 30 April; then he was transferred to a fighter squadron, Escadrille 57, in May 1916.

[[Marcus Petronius Mamertinus]]
CATEGORIES: 2nd-century Romans

Marcus Petronius Mamertinus, possibly known as Sextus Petronius Mamertinus (died c. 156) was an African Roman politician who lived in the 2nd century in the Roman Empire.
Petronius originally came from a wealthy family of Equestrian order, possibly from Egypt. He became a prominent politician during the reign of Roman Emperors Hadrian (117-138) and Antoninus Pius (138-161). From 133-137, he served as Prefect of Egypt and in 139-143 served as Praetorian prefect in Rome. 
Due to his outstanding service, Antoninus Pius promoted him to Senatorial rank. Antoninus Pius awarded Petronius the suffect consulship of 150. Petronius married an unnamed African Roman noblewoman and they had three children: a son Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus who served as consul in 182 who married Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor (one of the daughters of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius), Marcus Petronius Sura Septimianus who served as consul in 190 and a daughter who had married the illustrious Roman Senator Marcus Antoninus Antius Lupus.

The road itself is three lanes in each direction with a sidewalk on each side. The bridge won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal at the International Bridge Conference in 2003.

Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus (died 190-192) was a Roman consul that lived in the 2nd century and was one of the sons-in-law of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
Mamertinus came from a wealthy, well-connected family of African Roman origins possibly from Egypt. His father Marcus Petronius Mamertinus was suffect consul in 150 and his mother was an unnamed African Roman noblewoman.  He had a brother Marcus Petronius Sura Septimianus who served as consul in 190 and had a sister who had married the illustrious Roman Senator Marcus Antoninus Antius Lupus. Mamertinus was a kinsman of the Roman Grammarian Marcus Cornelius Fronto. 
During the reign of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180) and The Roman Empress Faustina the Younger (161-175), Mamertinus was betrothed to and later married Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor, one of the daughters of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger in Rome.
Sometime after 173, Cornificia Faustina bore Mamertinus a son, Petronius Antoninus. Mamertinus with his family could have been at the winter camp of Marcus Aurelius in early 180.
When Marcus Aurelius died in 180, the brother of Cornificia Faustina, Commodus succeeded her father as Roman Emperor. In 182, Mamertinus had served as consul. Between 190-192, Commodus had ordered the deaths of Mamertinus, his son, his brother and his sister’s family. Cornificia Faustina survived the political persecutions of her brother and later remarried.

At the 1968 election, the party ran on a platform of economic development, increased pensions, and good governance.  It promised to end the autocratic style of government practiced by the CIP's Albert Henry, end family and party appointments to the public service, and ensure public service neutrality.Stone (1970), p. 160.

T. Peter Park (born Tiidn Peter Park,google.com 1941) is an historian, a former librarian, and a prolific Fortean commentator on anomalous phenomena.Kevin D. Randle,  "Book reviews" The Society for Scientific Exploration According to Chris Perridas, Park is "a foremost Fortean authority on H. P. Lovecraft and the cultural impact his writing has had on our culture through folklore."Chris Perridas, "Interview with T. Peter Park, Fortean authority on H.P. Lovecraft" horrorlibrary.net 
Born in Estonia, Park has lived most of his life in the United States. He received a Master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1965. His Master's thesis was a comparison of the racial views of John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle. In 1970, he received a PhD in Modern European history from the University of Virginia."Too Many Anomalies, Not Enough Time" 
His PhD dissertation, entitled "The European reaction to the execution of Francisco Ferrer," described and analyzed the protests to the execution of a Spanish anarchist educator.The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer:" Por la Verdad y la Justicia" GC Fidler History of Education Quarterly, 1985 - jstor.orghttp://books.google.com/books?id=NBsQHAAACAAJ&dq=%22The+European+Reaction+to+the+Execution+of+Francisco+Ferrer,%22&ei=UApIS_vLJZK-MsKMyIwO&cd=1http://www.mail-archive.com/mythfolk@yahoogroups.com/msg00759.html He has a strong interest in anomalous phenomena, philosophy, linguistics, social psychology, and the history of social and scientific world views."Too Many Anomalies, Not Enough Time" He currently lives on Long Island, New York. 
In an email to a Fortean LISTSERV, Park described his approach towards anomalous phenomena as "basically 'open-minded hard science'". I find cultural attitudes toward anomalous phenomena as intriguing as the phenomena themselves. I think many Fortean mysteries (e.g., ESP, ghosts, UFO's, abductions, "Bigfoot" and other "Hairy Hominids," "Nessie" and other Lake Monsters, etc.) do involve genuine, fascinating scientific or even cosmological puzzles--but also reflect social and cultural attitudes, tensions, and conflicts, as well. I have a basically "open-minded hard science" approach to things like UFO's, abductions, "Hairy Hominids," and "Lake Monsters," tending to favor extraterrestrial and unknown-animals explanations for whatever defies a more mundane explanation--but I'm also still open to parapsychological, "paraphysical," or "metaphysical" explanations as well, for the more truly weird and bizarre cases. However, if "psychic" or "metaphysical" explanations don't seem to be really called for, but something rather unusual was still seen, I would still favor a "nuts and bolts" ETH ufology and a "flesh and blood, fur and feathers" cryptozoology in preference to occultist approaches. I think the modern "mainstream" scientific world-picture is mostly correct so far as it stands, but also quite incomplete--with paranormal and "Fortean" phenomena pointing to some of its gaps and omissions. In my own outlook and orientation, I personally very much straddle the "Two Cultures" of "mainstream"
 academic, scholarly, scientific, and literary "high culture" on the one hand, and of parapsychology and Forteanism on the other."Introducing myself to fort-@yahoogroups.com"
In an 2006 article in Fate magazine entitled "Little Men, Hobbits, and Ultra-Pygmies", Park discussed the Homo floresiensis find with cross-cultural legends of little people.http://www.fatemag.com/issues/2000s/2006-08.html FATE magazine, August 2006 Volume 59, Number 8, Issue 676

Arthur E. "Art" Bartlett (November 26, 1933 – December 31, 2009) was an American entrepreneur and founder of the Century 21 Real Estate franchise. He and a partner founded the company in 1971 with a single office, which had expanded to 7,700 offices worldwide by the time of his death, though he had sold the business to Trans World Corporation in 1979 for nearly $90 million.
Bartlett was born in Glens Falls, New York, and moved with his family to Long Beach, California in the 1940s. He attended Long Beach City College, but did not graduate.Lazo, Alejandro. "Arthur E. Bartlett dies at 76; co-founder of Century 21", Los Angeles Times, January 6, 2010. Accessed January 7, 2010. After a series of other jobs, he took up real estate in the early 1960s, accepting a position with a residential real estate firm in the San Fernando Valley.Hevesi, Dennis. "Art Bartlett, Founder of Century 21 Real Estate, Dies at 76", The New York Times, January 6, 2010. Accessed January 7, 2010. He would own his own real estate company, and met his future partner, Marshall Fisher, at a chance meeting at a diner.
Together with Fisher, he founded Century 21 with a single office in Santa Ana, California in 1971. The business sought to provide independent real estate agencies with the combined advertising, training and brand recognition of the parent franchiser — including its distinctive gold-colored jackets — helping them compete with national and regional chains. By 1977, Century 21 had 6,000 brokers and the firm's share of commissions and other licensing fees the following year reached $23 million. Trans World Corporation bought the company in 1979 for $28.50 per share in cash and convertible preferred stock, in a deal that valued the company at $89 million.Staff. "Trans World Corp. To Buy Century 21", The New York Times, July 26, 1979. Accessed January 7, 2010. By the time of his death, the company had 120,000 agents and 7,700 offices worldwide.
Another real estate-related franchise — a home improvement chain called Mr. Build International — was established in the early 1980s, but was closed down by the end of the decade.
Bartlett died at age 76 as a result of complications of Alzheimer's disease while at his home in Coronado, California. He was survived by his second wife, Nancy Sanders, as well as by a daughter, a stepson, a granddaughter and three stepgrandchildren. His first marriage, to the former Collette Cupiss, ended with her death in 2002.

Ignacio de Arteaga y Bazán (17 February 1731 – 1783) was an officer of the Spanish Navy. He was born in Aracena, Andalusia. His paternal Basque family 'Arteaga' made it possible for Arteaga to join the naval academy at Cádiz.[tpl]cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC&pg=PA348 |pages= 348–349[/tpl] He was accepted as a guardiamarina (midshipman) in 1747 and upon graduation in 1754 was given the rank of alférez de fragata (ensign). After serving on various ships and in various places he was transferred to Havana in 1766 and given his first command, the sloop Vibora. In 1767 he was promoted to teniente de navío (lieutenant).[tpl]cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |pages= 348–349[/tpl]
In 1771 Arteaga returned to Spain and tried to marry without certain required royal and ecclesiastical permissions. The priest who was to perform the marriage ceremony refused and Arteaga made an appeal to the ecclesiastical tribunal. During the proceedings grew abusive and insulting. As a consequence he was imprisoned for three years in the jail of the naval arsenal at La Carraca, Cádiz.
In 1774 he was released. Although allowed to continue his career in the navy he was exiled to the remote naval station at San Blas, on the west coast of New Spain. He arrived in San Blas in 1775. He was given command of an expedition to Alaska in 1779. Two frigates were assigned, the Favorita, commanded by Arteaga, and the Princesa, under Bodega y Quadra. With Bodega y Quadra on the Princesa was second officer Francisco Antonio Mourelle, surgeon Mariano Nunez Esquivel, pilot Jose Canizares, and second pilot Juan Bautista Aguirre.[tpl]cite web |title= The Spanish Navy in the Californias during the Revolutionary War Era |publisher= The California State Military Museum |url= http://www.militarymuseum.org/SpanishNavy.html |accessdate= 6 December 2009[/tpl] The expedition's objective was to evaluate the Russian penetration of Alaska, search for a Northwest Passage, and capture James Cook if they found him in Spanish waters. Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra did not find Cook, who had been killed in Hawaii in February 1779.
The two frigates sailed directly from San Blas to Bucareli Bay, Alaska. The voyage of 81 days, which was relatively fast, leaving time for further exploration. Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra carefully surveyed Bucareli Bay then headed north to present-day Port Etches on Hinchinbrook Island, near the entrance to Prince William Sound. While the ships were anchored, Arteaga took a party ashore to perform a formal possession ceremony.[tpl]cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |pages= 94–95[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Hayes |first= Derek |title= Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |year= 1999 |publisher= Sasquatch Books |isbn= 1-57061-215-3 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=sl57oHrVXGoC |pages= 40–41[/tpl]  All the officers and chaplains went ashore in procession, raised a large cross while cannons and muskets fired salutes. The Te Deum was sung, followed by a litany and prayers. After a sermon was preached a formal deed of possession was drawn up and signed by the officers and chaplains. Arteaga named the site Puerto de Santiago, commemorating Saint James, the patron saint of Spain, whose feast day falls on July 25.[tpl]GNIS|1424573|Port Etches[/tpl]   The title to Puerto de Santiago was important for years afterward, as it formed the basis of Spain's claim to sovereignty in the North Pacific up to 61°17′N.
Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra also explored Cook Inlet, and the Kenai Peninsula, where a possession ceremony was performed on August 2, 1779, in what today is called Port Chatham. Due to various sicknesses among the crew Arteaga decided to return south. On September 8, the ships rejoined and began the return trip to San Blas. Although the Spanish were normally secretive about their exploring voyages and the discoveries made, the 1779 voyage of Arteaga and Bodega y Quadra became widely known. La Perouse obtained a copy of their map, which was published in 1798. Mourelle's journal was acquired and published in London in 1798 by Daines Barrington.
After returning to San Blas, Arteaga requested and received a royal pardon and reinstatement of his loss of pension. He did not go to sea again, due to "broken health". Arteaga served as commandant of the naval department of San Blas until his death in 1783. Shortly before he died he was promoted to capitán de fragata (commander)—his first promotion in 16 years.

[[Marros Group]]

CATEGORIES: Carboniferous geologic formations, Geology of Wales

The Marros Group is the name given to a suite of rocks of Namurian age laid down during the Carboniferous Period in South Wales. These rocks were formerly known as the Millstone Grit Series but are now distinguished from the similar but geographically separate rock sequences of the Pennines and Peak District of northern England and northeast Wales by this new name.
The Group comprises a thick unit of coarse sandstone known as the Twrch Sandstone (formerly the ‘Basal Grit’) which is overlain by the Bishopston Mudstone and the Telpyn Point Sandstone. The mudstones of these latter two formations was formerly known as the ‘Middle Shales’, a name reflecting the position of this sequence sandwiched between the Basal Grit below and the Farewell Rock, the lowermost sandstone of the South Wales Coal Measures, above. The mudstone itself contains a few bands of sandstone such as the ‘Twelve Foot Sandstone’ and locally the ‘Cumbriense Sandstone’.

[[1913 Michigan Wolverines football team]]

CATEGORIES: 1913 NCAA football season, Michigan Wolverines football seasons, 1913 in Michigan

The 1913 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1913 college football season. The season was Fielding H. Yost's 13th as Michigan's head football coach.  The team compiled a record of 6–1, outscored opponents 175 to 21, and shut out four opponents while giving up an average of only three points per game.
After opening the season with wins against two Ohio colleges (Case and Mt. Union), the Wolverines lost to Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) by a score of 12–7.  It was Michigan's first loss in the history of its cross-state rivalry with the East Lansing institution.  Following the loss to the Aggies, star halfback Jimmy Craig, who had decided to quit playing football, returned to the team upon "urgent pleading by the entire student body."  In his season debut, Craig scored four touchdowns in the first half.  Though he played in only two-and-a-half games in 1913, Craig scored seven touchdowns and received consensus All-American honors, including a first-team selection by Walter Camp.
During its decade-long absence from the Western Conference, Michigan played inter-sectional rivalry games against Penn (12 games in 12 years from 1906–1917), Syracuse (10 games from 1908–1918), Cornell (7 games from 1911–1917), and Vanderbilt (7 games from 1905–1914).  In the final month of the season, Michigan defeated its four inter-sectional rivals by a combined score of 106 to 9.  Ohio State joined the Western Conference in 1913 and was barred by a Conference rule from playing Michigan.  For this reason, there was a hiatus in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry from 1913 to 1917.
Craig and tackle Miller Pontius were both selected as consensus first-team All-Americans.  Two other players received first-team All-American honors from at least one selector.  They were center and team captain George "Bubbles" Paterson, and quarterback Tommy Hughitt.

CATEGORIES: Al-Qaeda members, Living people

Abu Ayoub al-Iraqi has been credited with being one of the original founders of al-Qaeda, but he does not appear on public "wanted" lists and his status is apparently not known.[ref]
</ref>
In the 2001 trial for the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in Africa, Jamal al-Fadl testified that he first met Abu Ayoub al-Iraqi at a worldwide jihad group in a meeting in Khost, Afghanistan in 1989.  Al-Fadl termed him the "emir" of al-Qaeda, but clarified that he was always second to Osama bin Laden.
Abu Ayoub was replaced by Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri as emir, apparently sometime before 1991, according to trial testimony from both al-Fadl and  L'Houssaine Kherchtou. Al-Banshiri  died in an accidental drowning in 1996. as L'Houssaine Kherchtou described Abu Ubaidah as al-Qaeda's second-in-command at that time. Other material suggests, however, that he was #3, since he was replaced by Mohammed Atef.[ref]

Bustamite is a calcium manganese inosilicate (chain silicate) and a member of the wollastonite group. Magnesium, zinc and iron are common impurities substituting for manganese. It is a polymorph of johannsenite, with bustamite as the high-temperature form of CaMnSi2O6 and johannsenite as the low temperature form. The inversion takes place at 830 °C, but may be very slow.Deer, W A, Howie, R A and Zussman, J (1978) Rock-Forming Minerals, 2nd edition, Volume 2A, pages 574-585

CATEGORIES: 1996 deaths, Architects from Hawaii, Year of birth missing

George J. "Pete" Wimberly (died 1996) was an architect known for his work in Honolulu, Hawaii and for his firm's designs of resorts. He was part of the architectural firm of Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo until his death in 1996.The Rebranding of Wimberly, Allison, Tong & Goo March 14, 2008 Architect Design 
Wimberly came to Hawaii in 1940 as a "journeyman architect doing naval work at Pearl Harbor." After the war he worked with Howard Cook in the architectural firm of Wimberly and Cook. The rehabilitation of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel was one of his first jobs and many more followed. His work is typified by the use of local materials such as coral stone, lava rock, wood beams, thatch, bamboo, and glass; local "forms" such as flowing indoor/outdoor open spaces sheltered by big dramatic roofs with big eaves; and "liberal use of figurations, patterns and motifs derived from the cultures of the Pacific".
An article in Honolulu Weekly said Wimberly "established himself as perhaps the most successful resort architect in the world" and that his "Honolulu—based firm of Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo,also known as WATG, designed many of the Pacific Rim's pace-setting hotels and is now the world's largest "niche" architecture firm, specializing in the $4-trillion-dollar travel industry." He did numerous small scale projects on the Hawaiian islands until after 1960 when tourism and travel greatly expanded tourism and he started working on larger projects, a "construction boom that... led to the demolition of" many buildings Wimberly designed.
He was "instrumental" in founding the Pacific Asia Travel Association in 1952 with Bill Mullahey, the regional chief of Pan American Airlines, after traveling the Pacific in the 1950s "looking for new destinations, new hotel opportunities" in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Fiji, Jakarta, Singapore, and Bali. 
Wimberly was an avid outdoorsman, according to his working partner of 27 years, Donald Goo.[ref]Curt Sanburn The Way We Were;
His buildings set the tone for Waikïkï. Maybe we should take another look at what Peter Wimberly built. December 20, 2000 Honolulu Weekly[/ref] He relocated to Southern California late in life before returning to Honolulu when he became terminally ill with emphysema.

CATEGORIES: 2008 television seasons, Ed, Edd n Eddy seasons

The animated comedy television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, created by Danny Antonucci, revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, jawbreakers. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. Its sixth season was ordered along with a fifth season and three holiday specials after Cartoon Network renewed the series, meaning that the fourth season would not be the final, as it was set to be. The four original seasons were set during perpetual summer vacation, the new seasons showed the Eds and children going to school, the fifth during fall, and the sixth during winter. 
Although with the season, the series was set to air a total of 78 half-hours, although only one, consisting of two episodes, aired on June 29, 2008; the season was postponed due to Antonucci's production team at a.k.a. Cartoon wanted to concentrate on the TV movie series finale Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, after the series broke records as the longest-running original Cartoon Network series and Canadian-made animated series to date. Both aired episodes were created in 2007.

Yamaguchi At-large district is a constituency of the House of Councillors in the Diet of Japan (national legislature). It consists of the entire prefecture of Yamaguchi and is represented by two Councillors electing one every three years.
Single-member districts usually get higher attention in House of Councillors elections because they are easier to swing completely than multi-member districts. But Yamaguchi has consistently voted for LDP candidates between the 1960s and 1980s. In the 1989 election when the ruling LDP lost the upper house majority for the first time, Socialist Kenichi Yamada beat incumbent Masuo Matsuoka by a margin of more than 100,000 votes. Matsuoka later ran as an independent and won Yamaguchi again in 1998. He later joined the Democratic Party of Japan.
Currently Yamaguchi is represented by two Councillors:

[[Well travelled road effect]]
CATEGORIES: Cognitive biases

The well travelled road effect is a cognitive bias in which travellers will estimate the time taken to traverse routes differently depending on their familiarity with the route. Frequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes.Allan, L.G. (1979). The perception of time. Perception & Psychophysics, 26, 340-354.Zakay, B., & Block, R.A. (2004). Prospective and retrospective duration judgments: an executive-control perspective. Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis, 64, 319-328 This effect creates errors when estimating the most efficient route to an unfamiliar destination, when one candidate route includes a familiar route, whilst the other candidate route includes no familiar routes. The effect is most salient when subjects are driving, but is still detectable for pedestrians and users of public transport. Much like the Stroop TaskZakay D., & Fallach, E. (1984). Immediate and remote time estimation – a comparison. Acta Psychologica, 57, 69-81. it is hypothesised that drivers use less cognitive effort when traversing familiar routes and therefore underestimate the time taken to traverse the familiar route.Rubia, K. & Smith, A. (2004). The neural correlates of cognitive time management: a review. Acta Neurobiologica, 64, 329-340. The effect has been observed for centuries but was first studied scientifically in the 1980s and '90s following from earlier fallacy work undertaken by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.An empirical study of travel time variability and travel choice behavior. Transportation Science, 16, 460–475, Jackson, W., & Jucker, J. Steven J. Milloy (1981) The well travelled road effect has been hypothesised as a reason that self-reported experience curve effects are overestimated (see Experience curve effects).

[[Thorns, spines, and prickles]]
CATEGORIES: Plant morphology, Ecology, Biological evolution, Biological defense mechanisms

In plant morphology, thorns, spines, prickles, and in general spinose structures (as spinose teeth, spinose apical process) are all hard structures with sharp, stiff, ends, generally with the same function of mechanically deterring herbivory. In common language the terms are used more or less interchangeably, but in botanical terms, thorns are derived from shoots (so they can be branched or not, they can have leaves or not, and they arise from a bud),Simpson, M. G. 2010. "Plant Morphology". In: Plant Systematics, 2nd. edition. Elsevier Academic Press. Chapter 9.Judd, Campbell, Kellogg, Stevens, Donoghue. 2007. "Structural and Biochemical Characters".

How to identify trees in South Africa. Struik. spines are derived from leaves (the entire leaf or some part of the leaf that has vascular bundles inside, like the petiole or a stipule), and prickles are derived from the epidermis (so they can be found anywhere on the plant, and don't have vascular bundles inside so they can be removed more easily and cleanly than thorns and spines). Leaf margins also may have teeth and if those teeth are sharp they are called spinose teeth, on a spinose leaf margin (some authors consider them a kind of spine). On a leaf apex, if there is an apical process (generally an extension of the midvein), and if it is specially sharp, stiff, and spinelike, it can be called spinose or pungent apical process (again, some authors call them a kind of spine) When epidermis is covered with very long, stiff trichomes (more correctly called bristles in this case, for some authors a kind of prickle) is called hispid vestiture, if is covered with stinging trichomes it can be called urent vestiture.

Types of spines. Cacti can have a particular kind of spine (modified leaf) very small and deciduous, with numerous retrorse barbs along its length, this particular spine is called glochidium (plural glochidia or glochids), as found in areoles of Opuntia. Spines can be petiolar spines as those of Foquieria, leaflet spines as in Phoenix, stipular spines as in Euphorbia, all those are examples of spines developing from a part of a leaf containing the petiole, midrib, or a secondary vein.

[[Dodge Little Red Wagon]]
CATEGORIES: 1965 introductions, Drag racing, Dodge vehicles

The Dodge Little Red Wagon is an exhibition drag racing truck first introduced in 1965 and was world's fastest truck at the time and first wheelstanding truck.
Owned and driven by Bill "Maverick" Golden and based on the compact Dodge A100 pickup, the truck toured extensively throughout the United States and was frequently seen in television commercials for Dodge trucks. 
Builders Jim Schaeffer and John Collier performed extensive modifications to the A100 in order to fit a 426 Hemi engine and TorqueFlite automatic transmission.  Since the A100 was a cabover design, Schaeffer and Collier opted to install the drivetrain in a roughly amidships configuration between the rear of the cab and the front of the pickup bed within a welded steel subframe.
Parts deemed unnecessary were removed from the body, among them the heater, dashboard, front bumper and all body sealer.  The passenger doors were replaced with fiberglass units.  The Little Red Wagon's first dragstrip run netted a mid-11 second quarter mile at 120 mph (193 km/h).http://www.allpar.com/model/littleredwagon.html History and photos of the Little Red Wagon at Allpar.com
The vehicle was not originally intended to perform wheelstands; the slight rearward bias caused the nose to lift in the air for nearly the entire quarter-mile run.
Golden soon purchased the truck from Dodge for use as an exhibition racer.  The Little Red Wagon debuted in the 1965 season opener at Lions Drag Strip in Long Beach, California in front of 10,000 fans and reporters from major newspapers and automotive publications.  
The vehicle suffered three wrecks in 1969, 1971 and again in 1975.  After the 1975 wreck, Golden converted a non-operable show truck and campaigned it for the next thirty years.
Golden entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1977 with a 4230' (1289m) wheelstand, approximately the length of three quarter-mile dragstrips.
In 2009, the Little Red Wagon was sold at RM Auctions Icons of Speed and Style Auction.  The vehicle was expected to fetch US$300,000; it was instead the auction's top seller at $550,000.http://www.rmauctions.com/auction-results-overview.cfm?SaleCode=RW09 Icons of Speed page ar RMAuctions.com
It is also the subject of a 1/25 scale model kit from IMC and was later reissued by Lindberg Models.http://www.lindberg-models.com/land_model72158.html Home page of the Lindberg 1/25 model kit

[[Misogyny in hip hop culture]]
CATEGORIES: Hip hop, African-American gender relations, Misogyny

Misogyny in hip hop culture refers to lyrics, videos or other aspects of hip hop culture that support, glorify, justify, or normalize the objectification, exploitation, or victimization of women.[tpl]sfn|Weitzer|Kubrin|2009|p=10[/tpl] It can range from innuendoes to stereotypical characterizations and defamations.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Terri M.|last2=Fuller|first2=Douglas B.|year=2006|url=http://www.electricprint.com/edu4/classes/readings/depository/gender/misogyny_music1.pdf|title=The Words Have Changed but the Ideology Remains the Same: Misogynistic Lyrics in Rap Music|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=36|issue=6|pages=938–957|doi=10.1177/0021934704274072[/tpl]
Scholars have proposed various explanation for the presence of misogyny in hip hop culture. Some have argued that rap artists use misogynistic lyrics and portrayals as a way to assert their masculinity or to demonstrate their authenticity as rappers.[tpl]cite book|last=Tsiopos-Wills|first=Katherine V.|editor1-first=Mickey|editor1-last=Hess|title=Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture| year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-08438-6|page=490|chapter=Eminem|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=LldOLnIQ66cC&pg=PA490[/tpl] Others have suggested that rap music is a product of its environment, reflecting mainstream attitudes toward women,[tpl]sfn|Bynoe|2006|p=264[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Dyson|2007|p=22[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cheney|2005|p=5[/tpl] and that hip hop artists have internalized negative stereotypes about women. Still other academics have stressed economic considerations, arguing that rappers use misogyny to achieve commercial success.
Content analyses have found that approximately 22% to 37% of rap lyrics contain some misogyny, depending on subgenre.[tpl]sfn|Weitzer|Kubrin|2009|pp=4–5, 11[/tpl] Individual artists have been shown to use such lyrics more frequently. Eminem, for example, used misogyny in eleven of the 14 songs on his third studio album. Common misogynistic themes include the use of derogatory names such as "bitch" and "ho", sexual objectification of women, legitimation of violence against women, distrust of women, and the glorification of prostitution and pimping.[tpl]sfn|Weitzer|Kubrin|2009|p=11[/tpl]
Responses to misogyny in hip hop music have ranged from criticism by women's rights activists, student protests and organized campaigns to a 2007 congressional hearing.[tpl]sfn|Sharpley-Whiting|2007|pp=19–20[/tpl] Female rap artists have used their music or started organizations to explicitly oppose hip hop misogyny or expressed resistance by using self-empowering lyrics and adopting an independent woman persona. By contrast, some female rap artists do not actively resist misogynistic portrayals.

CATEGORIES: 1854 births, 1910 deaths, Canadian speed skaters

Hugh J. McCormick (1854–1910) was the World Professional Speed Skating Champion from 1890 to 1891.   
Hugh McCormick was born at McCormick House on Kennebecasis Island, New Brunswick, Canada which is located at the confluence of the St. John River and Kennebecasis River.  Because these rivers freeze over for most of the Canadian winter a very conducive environment is naturally provided supporting ice skating of all varieties; the local area has been a producer of many champion speed skaters.
His career as a professional speed skater spanned the years 1883 through 1895 and he held numerous championship titles including New Brunswick Professional Speed Skating Champion, Canadian Maritime Champion, North American Champion and World Champion.  In 1890, he defeated reigning World Champion Axel Paulsen of Norway in a series of races held at Minneapolis, Minnesota to become the World Professional Speed Skating Champion.  In 1892, McCormick travelled to Oslo (then Christiania), Norway to race the new Norwegian champion, Harold Hagen.  Hagen defeated McCormick and was crowned the new World Professional Speed Skating Champion.  McCormick raced Hagen a second time the following season in 1893 in a three-race meet at Minneapolis but was again unsuccessful. McCormick retired from professional competition two years later at the end of the 1895 season.

The Tornquist Sea between Avalonia and Baltica probably formed at the same time (c. 600 Ma) as the Iapetus Ocean. Gondwana, including Avalonia until Early Ordovician, was separate from Baltica throughout the Cambrian. It probably closed during the Late Ordovician at the time of the Shelveian Orogeny of western England, and consistent with paleobiogeographic data and paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths for Eastern Avalonia and Baltica.
The suture resulting from closure of the Tornquist Sea may be seen in eastern England and the Lake District as an arc of igneous rocks belonging to the Ordovician. The volcanic series in eastern England, the Ardennes and the Northern Phyllite Belt originated between the Tornquist Sea and the Rheic Ocean during the Ordovician and Silurian.Orogenic processes: quantification and modelling in the Variscan Belt by Wolfgang Franke et al., Geological Society of London

The story, set in the ancient Chinese Song Dynasty (960 - 1279), concerns a boy named Haoyou Gou. At the beginning of the book, Gou Pei is showing Haoyou around the Chabi, Pei's ship, before he sets off somewhere around the world. Pei showed Haoyou where the anchor was lodged, where the sailors slept, how the ship was steered and where the cargo was kept. But the biggest excitement was yet to come, the captain of Chabi was going to 'test the wind', checking the omens for a prosperous voyage. Suddenly, the Chabi's First Mate took hold of Pei's jacket and pushed him over the edge of an open hatchway. It was no great fall, but Pei had landed awkwardly on top of sacks of rice. Haoyou decided that his mother should know about the fall. As he turned to run, he found his way blocked by the enormous stomachs of the merchants  to judge the omens for themselves. The prosperity of the entire voyage depended on how well the 'wind-tester' behaved If it flew badly, they would use a rival ship. To test the wind, the sailors use a huge kite. The kite was being carried along the deck by seven or eight sailors. Attached to the kite was a man. A cloth had been wrapped around his head. As the man twisted, struggling to break free, the cloth slipped down and Haoyou caught a glimpse of the mans face. The man was Gou Pei, Haoyou's father. Haoyou tried to stop them but his voice was a whisper against the chatter of the merchants and the waves of the sea. Haoyou did not know whether to run to his mother or carry on trying to stop the sailors. Haoyou wanted to look away from the terribleness but he couldn't. Haoyou watched his father get pulled and thrashed around in the air. As Pei was pulled down, everyone was staring, to see if Pei was alive or not but Haoyou knew that his father was dead, for he had seen his father go up into the clouds with a soul and come back down without one. After all that, Qing'an, Pei's wife, is being forced, by Haoyou's great-uncle Bo, to marry Di Chou, the very man who sent her husband to death. To save her, Haoyou must follow his father into the sky, ride a kite among the clouds and the spirits of the dead. Haoyou is a kite-maker and knows better than most how to ride the winds and survive. Then, the Jade Circus offers Haoyou a chance to escape from his enemies and travel throughout the Empire, and maybe even perform before the great Kublai Khan himself. Can Haoyou break the ties of duty which bind him? Is the circus master leading Haoyou into even greater danger?
The novel's themes include luck and spirituality.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

In their eighth year under head coach was Fritz Crisler, the Wolverines compiled a 7-3 record (5-1 Big Ten) and finished the season ranked #6 in the final Associated Press Poll.  Quarterback Joe Ponsetto was the team captain, and center Harold Watts won the Most Valuable Player award and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player.  
On October 13, 1945, the Wolverines lost, 28-7, to Army at Yankee Stadium in New York.  Outmanned by an Army team that was loaded with talent that included 1945 and 1946 Heisman Trophy winners Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis, Crisler unveiled a platoon system in which separate groups played offense and defense.[tpl]cite news|title=Football Platoon System Originator Fritz Crisler Dies|newspaper=Tyrone Daily Herald (UPI story)|date=1982-08-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Fritz Crisler Hall of Fame profile|publisher=College Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=40083[/tpl]  According to one account, Crisler developed the two-platoon system "in a bout of desperation."  Crisler later recalled, "I reported the plan to the players and told them we might have a lot of fun.  At the end of three periods we were tied 7-7 and I knew it couldn't last. I knew sooner or later Army would overpower us. And that's what happened.

Michigan's three losses during the 1945 season came against teams ranked in the top four in the final AP Poll: #1 Army (28-7 loss at Yankee Stadium), #2 Navy (33-7 loss at Baltimore Stadium), and #4 Indiana (13-7 loss at Michigan Stadium).  The Wolverines also defeated three ranked opponents in Illinois, Minnesota, and Ohio State.

Born in 1926, she started her work at 42, when she finished raising her children in a wealthy family.
She learned from the artist Albert Féraud. However, after she learned the techniques, she decided to go her own way by mostly working on geometrical sculptures. In a way, she followed the MADI art, from South America in the sculptural domain.
Her work is exclusively based on one material: polished stainless steel.
Her collection is only composed of unique, one of a kind, pieces.
She made sculptures of every size: from ash trays to a few meters high monumental sculpture, that were sometimes exposed in parks and large lobbies.
Her works traveled the country in expositions, museums, and public areas, like in Paris or Monaco.
Many articles were also published in magazines and newspapers about the artist herself and some of her art creations.
She died in 1992 in a car accident.

In the next match, Burnley achieved their first league victory when they won 4–3 against Bolton Wanderers.
Burnley's top goalscorer in the 1888–89 season was Scottish forward Pat Gallocher, who netted nine goals in all competitions, including Burnley's first in the Football League. Alec Brady was the top scorer in the league, with seven goals in 20 appearances. John Yates became the first Burnley player to be selected for an international match when he was called up to the England squad in March 1889, but despite scoring a hat-trick on his debut, he was never picked for England again.

Kaulinia is a genus of Polypodiaceae, a family of ferns. It has been named after Professor Kailas Nath Kaul, an Indian botanist and agricultural scientist. In a morphological study of the sporophytes and gametophytes of several species of Microsorum, it became apparent that at least two phyletically distinct groups of species existed in the genus. The group represented by Microsorum pteropus and Microsorum hancockii seemed to have a different ancestry from the other group, now a genus known as Kaulinia.

Parambil Mar Chandy Methran (alias Alexander Palliveettil,  Alexander de Campo) is the first known person to be appointed in India as a bishop from among the native Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala. Until his time Indians held the office of deacon, archdeacon etc. (There was a plan to appoint George of Christ,Archdeacon of Mar Abraham (1568–1597) as Metropolitan of India. Thus he should have become, according to the plans of Mar Abraham, supported by the Jesuits, the first indigenous Chaldaean Metropolitan of the St Thomas Christians. However, from the last letter of Mar Abraham, where he requests the Pope to confirm George’s ordination as Bishop of Palur and his successor, is dated January 13, 1584, while from another letter of the same Mar Abraham we learn that the consecration of George failed because of the latter’s death.Language of religion, language of the people: medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,Ernst Bremer, Susanne Röhl Page 401).

[[Phryganidia californica]]
CATEGORIES: Animals described in 1864, Notodontidae

The California Oakworm or California Oak Moth (Phryganidia californica) is a moth of the Notodontidae family. It is found along the coasts of California and Oregon. 
The wingspan is about 30 mm. They are tan to gray moths with prominent wing veins. Adults are on wing from March to November. There are two generations per year in northern California. Sometimes there is a third generation in southern California.
The larvae feed on the leaves of oak, especially Quercus agrifolia. Young larvae feed between veins on the lower leaf surface. Although the upper leaf surface is left intact, it dries out and turns brown. Larvae in later instars chew completely through the leaf blade, often leaving only major leaf veins. Small frass pellets drop from the canopy as larvae feed. In outbreak years, individual trees or groups of trees may be almost entirely defoliated, typically by late summer or early fall. The larvae are black with lengthwise yellow stripes. Full-grown larvae are about 30 mm long. Pupation takes place in a white or yellow pupa with black markings.

Amy Correia (born September 12, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter who grew up in Lakeville, Ma.CBS News
Correia lived in New York’s Chinatown after graduating from Barnard College. She worked in advertising, writing copy by day, while at night honing her songwriting and performing in clubs like Sin-é Cafe on the lower east side. A chance meeting with Blind Melon guitarist, Christopher Thorn, who’d stopped by the small club while on tour, led the two to make several recordings which helped Correia eventually sign with Virgin Records.
While signed to Virgin Records, Correia recorded an album of songs at Daniel Lanois’ Kingsway Studios in New Orleans with Christopher Thorn producing, but the album went unfinished. Correia left Virgin with her master recordings and signed with Capitol/EMI, which released her debut “Carnival Love” in 2000. Correia recorded the album “Lakeville” with her own money. It was produced by Mark Howard, who also has produced Willie Nelson and Lucinda Williams. The Canadian label, Nettwerk, licensed and released it in 2004.
Her third album, “You Go Your Way”, recorded in 2009 with producer/arranger/bassist Paul Bryan, was funded by her fans. The story was picked up by Anthony Mason for CBS News, who featured Correia as one of a growing number of artists who are looking to their fans rather than a label to fund their albums.
Correia is the recipient of three 2012 Independent Music Awards."11th Annual Independent Music Awards Winners Announced!" Independent Music Awards, 2 May 2012. Retrieved on 4 Sept. 2013. "You Go Your Way" was named best folk/singer-songwriter album by a panel of influential artists and industry professionals. "You Go Your Way" also won the Vox Pop award, determined by fan voting, for best folk/singer-songwriter album. The single, "Love Changes Everything" won the Vox Pop award for best love song.
Correia tours throughout the U.S. and has performed with artists including Marc Cohn, Richard Thompson, John Hiatt, Freedy Johnston, Emmylou Harris, Jason Crigler, Rebecca Martin, Josh Rouse, Duncan Sheik, Norah Jones, Bonnie Raitt, Richard Julian, Jesse Harris, Ollabelle, Aimee Mann, Kenny White, Jonathon Spottiswoode, Everclear, The Dandy Warhols, Allison Moorer, Tara McLean, Kendall Payne, Shannon McNally, Charlie Musselwhite, Jon Brion, Grant Lee Phillips, Dredd Scott, Julia Fordham, Jess Klein, Kerri Powers.

[[Mobile dialer]]
CATEGORIES: Mobile software

Mobile Dialer is a software application installed and used on mobile phones. Various software solution providers offer branded mobile dialers. They are used to make VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls from a mobile hand set. The "Mobile Dialer" or "Mobile VoIP Dialer" uses SIP signaling and can be mapped to a Softswitch or an IP device to work a device for voice communication. Newer mobile dialers also allow users to originate a Voice Call or SMS using their mobile handset. In many countries, VoIP is considered as "illegal Business" and is banned by the government. Mobile Dialer application can run behind network address translation (NAT) and on private IP and can pass through firewalls or blocked networks when combined with tunneling software.
Making calls from the mobile phone is most preferred way of calling.  Consumers may switch to VoIP as it offers international calling at affordable rates. Mobile Dialer allows users to use VoIP or Voice over Internet Protocol on their mobile phones with great ease.
Mobile dialers remove the traditional VoIP limitation of using computer or other VoIP devices restricted to home environment. New generation mobile phone users have access to varieties of internet services like GPRS, 3G and Wi-Fi connections which makes it easy to make VoIP calls from any place in cheaper rate. In that case, users need to install a supportive mobile dialer into their handset.

[[Gérard Rancinan]]

CATEGORIES: French photographers, Living people, 1953 births

Gérard Rancinan is a French photographer whose work has appeared in publications such as Sports Illustrated, Time, Life Magazine, Sunday Times Magazine, and Paris Match.
Gérard Rancinan started his career as an apprentice in the laboratory of the photo department of the Bordeaux daily newspaper, Sud Ouest. After three years in the dark room he became, at the age of 18, the youngest photojournalist in France, covering news around the region. When he was 21, he was sent to the newspaper’s agency in Pau.
Having been spotted by the newly founded press agency, Sygma, in 1973, Rancinan decided to sign a distribution contract with the firm. Five years later he became a Sygma staff photographer in Paris. He covered events all over the world, from earthquakes in Algeria to political upheavals in Poland, and from the war in Lebanon to riots in England. As well as such dramatic events, he also covered sport (Olympic Games, Football World Cups, World Athletics Championships), and movie shoots (Ran by Akira Kurosawa, Betty Blue by Jean-Jacques Beineix, The Last Emperor by Bernardo Bertolucci). At the same time, he kept a close eye on the stars of show business, fashion and the cinema.
He left Sygma in 1986 to set up his own agency, before once again becoming independent in 1989.
His portraits of leading personalities (Fidel Castro, Pope John Paul II, François Mitterrand, Monica Bellucci, Tiger Woods, Yasser Arafat, Bill Gates, etc) and his photographic “sagas” describing major societal developments are published regularly on the front pages of magazines including  Paris Match, Life Magazine, Stern, The Sunday Times Magazine, etc. Since 1984, Rancinan has also worked on a regular basis with Sports Illustrated, the biggest sports magazine in the US. In all his major projects, he collaborates with writers, journalists, thinkers, sociologists, anthropologists and philosophers (Caroline Gaudriault, Virginie Luc, Paul Virilio, etc.).
In the 1990s, Pierre Cornette de Saint-Cyr helped to point Rancinan in the director of the art world by producing the exhibition Urban Jungle at the Espace Cardin in Paris in 2000.
Today, recognized the world over, Gérard Rancinan’s work is displayed in numerous international galleries and museums (Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art: "Portrait of Nathalie", Triennale di Milano: "Portraits of Cardinals", Palais de Tokyo Muséum, Paris: "Metamorphoses") "Trilogy of the Moderns", Triennale di Milano - Contemporary Art Museum, Italie and features in prestigious private contemporary art collections.
At an auction at the Étude Million at the l'Hôtel Drouot in 2008, the price commanded by Gérard Rancinan’s work put him firmly in the upper echelons of French contemporary art photographers (Sud Ouest, Monday, June 2, 2008).
With the photograph, “Batman Girls”, commanding a record price in London in May 2012, the international auction house, Philip de Pury, confirmed Rancinan’s status outside France.
A committed photographer – “A watchful witness of the metamorphoses of Humanity”1 – Gérard Rancinan photographs his contemporaries and analyses the behaviours and beliefs characterizing modern societies.
Gérard Rancinan’s photographs are now studied in schools in France within the framework of the National Diploma (DNB) in the History of Art.
On January 7, 2013, Laurent Fabius, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, invited Rancinan to display, in one of the rooms of the Quai d'Orsay the photography, "Batman Boys" (300 x180 cm), thereby promoting the work of contemporary French artists abroad.

[[Texas District Courts]]

CATEGORIES: Texas state courts

The Texas District Courts form part of the Texas judicial system and are the trial courts of general jurisdiction of Texas. As of September 2011, 456 district courts serve the state, each with a single judge, elected by partisan election to a four-year term.  
District courts have original jurisdiction in all felony criminal cases, divorce cases, land title disputes, election contests, civil matters in which at least $200 is disputed or claimed in damages, as well as other matters. Most district courts consider both criminal and civil cases but, in counties with many courts, each may specialize in civil, criminal, juvenile, or family law matters.
Districts can cover a single county or several counties, with many districts overlapping one another. Harris County, the state's most populous, is home to 59 district courts - each one covering the entire county.  While district courts can and do share courthouses and clerks to save money, each is still legally constituted as a separate court.  This is dramatically different from the situation in most U.S. states (or most other jurisdictions), in which a single trial court is staffed by multiple judges, each of whom has authority to act in the name of that court. 
In sparsely populated areas, a single district can cover numerous counties: several districts span five counties, for example. Some counties share numerous overlapping districts, such as the 12 districts that serve the same 13 county region of central and eastern Texas, with each district covering the entirety of the 13 counties.

He was born in Solum as a son of dean Theodor Ording (1837–1908) and Johanne Gabrielle Gustava Andrea Hauge (1851–90). He was a grandson of Andreas Hauge, and great-grandson of Hans Nielsen Hauge. He was also a first cousin of Johannes Ording[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Hans Ording|encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon|first=Helge|last=Fæhn|authorlink=Helge Fæhn|editor=Helle, Knut|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hans_Ording/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] and Fredrik Ording, and thus a first cousin once removed of actor Jørn Ording, politician Aake Anker Ording and historian and politician Arne Ording.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Ording|first=Terje|last=Bratberg|encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Ording|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]
He took the examen artium at Kristiania Cathedral School in 1902, and the cand.theol. degree in 1909. He worked in Tromsø and Hammerfest before being hired as a priest for Norwegians in Berlin in 1914. He married German citizen Annelise Fechter (1890–1984) here in December 1916. In the same year he was appointed as a research fellow at the Royal Frederick University. He finished the thesis Untersuchungen über Entwicklungslehre und Teleologi in 1921, which earned him the dr.theol. degree in 1922.
After this he was a curate in Berg i Østfold from 1922 to 1928, curate in Frogner from 1928 to 1935 and vicar in Frogner from 1935 to 1939. In 1939 he was appointed as professor at the University of Oslo, a position which had been vacant for a year, in waiting of Ording to finish the book Dogmatisk metode.

Anne Gainsford, Lady Zouche (died c.1590) was a close friend and lady-in-waiting to Queen consort Anne Boleyn.
She was in the household of Anne Boleyn, as early as 1528 before the latter became the second wife of Henry VIII of England five years later. She served Anne Boleyn before and after her own marriage to Sir George Zouche of Codnor. It was Anne to whom Anne Boleyn lent her proscribed copy of William Tyndale's The Obedience of a Christian Man.Antonia Fraser, The Wives of Henry VIII, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1992, p.145Anne Gainsford or Gaynsford (d. before 1548), A Who’s Who of Tudor Women: G, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) Retrieved 29 July 2013. After it was stolen in jest by her bethrothed, George Zouche, it fell into the hands of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. After its return, Anne Boleyn persuaded the King to read the book.
Following Anne Boleyn's marriage to the King in 1533, Anne remained in her service as her lady-in-waiting. In May 1536, she was obliged to testify against Queen Anne at her trial.
George Wyatt, the first biographer of Anne Boleyn, compiled his book on the Queen largely based on information provided by the reminiscences of Anne Gainsford.Bruce, Marie Louise, Anne Boleyn, Warner Paperback Library edition, 1972, pp. 40, 162.

[[John Ferneley]]

CATEGORIES: 1782 births, 1860 deaths, 19th-century English painters, People from Leicestershire, Sporting artists

John E. Ferneley (18 May 1782 Thrussington, Leicestershire - 1860 Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire), was an English painter who specialised in portraying sporting horses and hunting scenes. Although his rendition of horses was stylised, he is regarded as one of the great British equine artists, second perhaps only to George Stubbs. 
At first apprenticed until 1801 to his father, who was a master wheelwright, he was encouraged to take up painting by John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland. Accordingly he moved to London and studied under the sporting artist Benjamin Marshall. While training with Marshall he joined the Royal Academy School. His work was exhibited between 1806 and 1853 at the Royal Academy. He traveled extensively in Ireland from 1806 to 1809, but returned to England to marry, and started working from Melton Mowbray. Here he built his studio and later a house, Elgin Lodge, on the Scalford Rd. Melton Mowbray was fast becoming a watering hole for the sporting fraternity and the place where modern fox-hunting developed in the late eighteenth century. Hugo Meynell, a wealthy local bred his hounds to keep up with the horses and riders in their pursuit over hedges and ditches. At this time riders began wearing the scarlet jackets which were to become traditional. 
Ferneley's paintings depicted hunting when it was extremely fashionable. Good horses sold quite readily for 200 guineas and most riders had at least ten in their stables. His work became much sought after, his patrons including many Royals and personalities such as Beau Brummel and the Count d'Orsay. Ferneley routinely was commissioned to paint the famous Quorn, Belvoir, and Cottesmore hunts. The members all contributed to the painter's fee and then drew lots to determine the winner. Ferneley specialised in painting "scurries", panoramic paintings showing a sequence of events.http://www.bergercollection.org/index.php?id=5&artwork_id=22 He befriended Sir Francis Grant and helped him with the painting of horses while Grant in return helped with figure painting. In this way they collaborated on a number of paintings. Ferneley's signature was done very delicately with a pin head in the wet paint and often hidden on a fence, stable door or in an unexpected corner of the painting. His signature is easily differentiated from that of his son, John Junior, who normally signed heavily in black.http://www.horseandhoundart.com/John_Ferneley_Sr.htm
Between 1810 and 1812 he visited Ireland twice more, carrying out a great number of commissioned paintings for wealthy Irish patrons. He produced six children with his first wife (who died in 1836) - three of his children later became painters.
Ferneley kept a set of account books dating between 1807 and 1860; the detailed notes providing useful material for later historians.http://www.invaluable.com/artist/ferneley-john,-i-ocj7idsi5f#bio
John Ferneley College in Melton Mowbray, is named after him.

[[Water law in the United States]]

CATEGORIES: Water law in the United States

In the United States there are complex legal systems for allocating water rights that vary by region. These varying systems exist for both historical and geographic reasons. Water law encompasses a broad array of subjects or categories designed to provide a framework to resolve disputes and policy issues relating to water: 
The law governing these topics derives from all layers of law. Some derives from common law principles which have developed over centuries, and which evolve as the nature of disputes presented to courts change. For example, the judicial approach to landowner rights to divert surface waters has changed significantly in the last century as public attitudes about land and water have evolved. Some derives from state statutory law. Some derives from the original public grants of land to the states and from the documents of their origination. Some derives from state, federal, and local regulation of waters through zoning, public health, and other regulation. (Federally recognized tribes may have water rights, but non-federally recognized Indian tribes generally do not.)

"Who Killed Archie?" is a storyline from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, which began on 25 December 2009, Christmas Day, when the character Archie Mitchell, played by Larry Lamb, was murdered by an unseen person. Events leading up to and following the murder put several characters in the frame, in the style of a whodunnit mystery. The culprit was kept a tight secret within the production crew as well, with only seven people knowing the identity of the killer. The murderer was revealed as Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) during a live episode titled "EastEnders Live", broadcast on 19 February 2010, the show's 25th anniversary. Turner was told thirty minutes before the broadcast that Stacey was the killer, and actors rehearsed several possible endings. Finally, a two-hander episode between Stacey and Max on 26 March 2010 explained how she killed Archie.

In underwater diving, ascending and descending is done using strict protocols to avoid problems caused by the changes in ambient pressure and the hazards of obstacles near the surface or collision with vessels. Diver certification and accreditation organisations place importance on these protocols early in their diver training programmes.
The procedures vary depending on whether the diver is using scuba or surface supplied equipment. Scuba divers control their own descent and ascent rate, while surface supplied divers may control their own ascents and descents, or be lowered and lifted by the surface team, either by their umbilical, or on a diving stage or in a diving bell.

[[Church of St Mary Magdalene, Winterbourne Monkton]]

CATEGORIES: Church of England churches in Wiltshire

The Church of St Mary Magdalene is the Anglican church in the Wiltshire village of Winterbourne Monkton. Its history dates from the 12th century and it lies in a peaceful setting in the Wiltshire countryside. The information leaflet inside the church tells us that what is now the chancel was originally the chapel, and although it is not known when it was built, it was standing in 1133.
An unusual feature inside the church consists of two huge tree trunks which originally supported the bells in the free-standing bell tower.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

[[Early centers of Christianity]]

CATEGORIES: Early Christianity, Christianity under the Roman Empire

Early Christianity (generally considered the time period from its start to 325), spread from the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, reaching as far east as India. Originally, this progression was closely connected to already established Jewish centers, in the Holy Land and the Jewish diaspora. The first followers of Christianity were Jews or biblical proselytes, commonly referred to as Jewish Christians and Godfearers.
The Apostolic Sees claim to have been founded by one or more of the Apostles of Jesus, who are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem sometime after the Crucifixion of Jesus, c. 26–36, perhaps following the Great Commission. Early Christians gathered in small private homes,Paul, for example, greets a house church in [tpl]bibleverse||Romans|16:5|NIV[/tpl]. known as house churches, but a city's whole Christian community would also be called a church – the Greek noun ἐκκλησία literally means assembly, gathering, or congregation[tpl]LSJ|e)kklhsi/a|ἐκκλησία|ref[/tpl].Bauer lexicon but is translated as church in most English translations of the New Testament.
Many of these Early Christians were merchants and others who had practical reasons for traveling to northern Africa, Asia Minor, Arabia, Greece, and other places.Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages (2005), pp. 19–20 Over 40 such communities were established by the year 100,Hitchcock, Geography of Religion (2004), p. 281, quote: "By the year 100, more than 40 Christian communities existed in cities around the Mediterranean, including two in North Africa, at Alexandria and Cyrene, and several in Italy."Bokenkotter, A Concise History of the Catholic Church (2004), p. 18, quote: "The story of how this tiny community of believers spread to many cities of the Roman Empire within less than a century is indeed a remarkable chapter in the history of humanity." many in Anatolia, also known as Asia Minor, such as the Seven Churches of Asia. By the end of the first century, Christianity had already spread to Rome, India, and major cities in Armenia, Greece and Syria, serving as foundations for the expansive spread of Christianity, eventually throughout the world.

The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge (1834–1837) was a monthly magazine based in Boston, Massachusetts. It was established by a group of engravers to "give to the public a work descriptive, not merely of subjects, scenes, places, and persons existing in distant climes, but also of those which are to be found in our own fine and native country."American Magazine, v.1, no.1; p.1. It featured profusely illustrated articles on many topics, including American animals, plants, natural scenery, colleges, banks, hospitals, churches, cities, technology, and so on; as well as biographical articles on figureheads of the revolutionary and federal eras. Modelled after the British Penny Magazine, it was published first by the Boston Bewick Company, then by William D. Ticknor and John L. Sibley."Several of the gentlemen interested in the magazine, are themselves engravers, and it may be said without vanity, that they have contributed in no small degree to bring that beautiful, though long neglected art, to the high point of perfection which it has attained in this country." American Magazine, v.1, no.1; p.1.The Boston Bewick Co. was affiliated with Abel Bowen;  George W. Boynton;  Lewis H. Bridgham;  Daniel H. Craig;  William Croome;  John C. Crossman;  George A.

As a result of dictatorships and Fabian socialism, which was the basis of Bangladesh's economy for more than 50 years, the concept of individual freedom and free markets is at a rudimentary stage in the country. For this reason, Bangladesh's topmost economists, politicians, businesspeople, and journalists who previously encouraged MOER's work gradually became skeptical of the idea of free markets. Consequently, the theory of free markets advocated by MOER is considered extreme in Bangladesh and the institute has not gained widespread support. Its support base is those people who philosophically believe in individual liberty and personal choice. Much of the work of MOER soon after its establishment focused on spreading the idea of individual freedom, which was almost unknown in the nation.
The annual budget of MOER is US$ 3,000 to US$ 5,000. Staff of the institute publish articles advocating free market and libertarianism in national newspapers.[tpl]Cite news|title = Teaching Free Markets in Bangladesh|newspaper = Highlights|location = Fairfax, Virginia|pages = 6|publisher = Atlas Economic Research Foundation|date = Spring 2009|url = http://atlasnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/2001_h-spring.pdf|accessdate = 2010-01-08[/tpl] MOER has published books both in Bengali and in English languages for free distribution to libraries with the help of the International Policy Network (IPN) headquartered in London.

This is a story about a young couple whose newly planned life was destroyed by the impact of the Great Purges of 1934–1938 in Mongolia.
The main goal of this movie was to provide a testimony for the many Buryats and Mongolians who were persecuted during the Great Purges initiated by Joseph Stalin. In 1937 and 1938, many people, and even entire families, were killed after being wrongfully accused of conspiracies.
The movie was shot on location near the Buryat village of Dadal in the Khentii province of Mongolia. The acting and other participation of many local villagers was a great addition to the authenticity of the film.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

[[Inter county]]
CATEGORIES: Gaelic Athletic Association terminology, Gaelic games culture

Inter county, or inter-county,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/1/1503121053-muldoon-announces-inter-county-retirement-/|title=Muldoon announces inter-county retirement|accessdate=2012-04-06[/tpl] is Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) terminology which refers to competitions or matches between GAA counties (which are somewhat different from legal counties). The term can also be used to describe the players on the teams.
The first inter county competitions the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship took place in 1887.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dundalkyoungirelands.com/club-information/93-1887-all-ireland-championship-|title=1887 All-Ireland Championship |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Inter county teams select the best players from the clubs within the county, a practice which began in 1892.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkl8r.com/talkl8r~39~39.htm|title=Talk later|accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] Before 1892 the winner of each counties club championship would represent the county in the All-Ireland championships.
The inter county season begins in January with each province's warm up competition and ends in September after the All Ireland final. The GAA's inter county competitions are the organisation's most attended competitions and are Ireland's most attended sporting events, while the All Ireland finals are the most watched.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf|publisher=The Economic and Social Research Institute |title=The Social Significance of Sport|accessdate=2008-10-21[/tpl] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in Ireland's sporting calendar.http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10004396.shtml
Usually each of the 32 GAA counties in Ireland participates in the inter county leagues and in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship; Kilkenny does not compete in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, and Cavan GAA does not currently compete in the National Hurling League although a non-county team, Fingal, does. London also competes in the Men's Hurling and Gaelic football championships and leagues, winning the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship once in 1901,
[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/page/roll_of_honour2.html|title=Roll of honour|accessdate=[/tpl] Warwickshire compete in the Men's hurling championship only, while New York compete in the Men's football championships; in the past they also competed in the Hurling championship.
In Great Britain, the British provincial council organise inter county competitions for the 7 counties under its control.[tpl]cite web|url=http://britain.gaa.ie/strongprovfixturesresultsstrongbrluaiteachaistoradhcige.html|title=Prov Fixtures / Results |accessdate=2010-01-08[/tpl] The British provincial council is the only area outside Ireland to organise regular inter county matches.
Changing clubs between counties is known as an inter county transfer and is regulated by the Provincial council if the clubs are in the same province, or by the central council of the GAA when the transferring between clubs in different provinces. A special transfer is available for students going on a J-1 visa, which allows a temporary transfer to Canada, New York or North America.

The Porrettana Railway (named after the spa town of Porretta Terme) is an Italian railway connecting Bologna to Pistoia and was the first line through the Apennines between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. It is also known in Italian as the Transappenninica ("trans-Apennines"). It was officially  called the Strada ferrata dell'Italia Centrale (“ Central Italy Railway”) and was officially inaugurated by King Victor Emmanuel II in 1864.
At the time it was an enormous engineering project with its 47 tunnels and 35 bridges and viaducts, with a total length of 99 km. The most difficult section was the 14 km stretch between Pracchia and Pistoia, which had a drop of 500 metres. The project was put in the charge of the French engineer Jean Louis Protche who solved the problem by designing a spiral tunnel  between Piteccio and Corbezzi.  This solution was then used for the construction of the Gotthard Tunnel. In Porretta Terme a square was dedicated to Protche and Victor Emmanuel II, who opened the line. In was electrified on the three-phase system (3,700 V at 16.7 Hz) in 1927 and re-electrified with 3,000 V DC in 1934.

The Battle of Cao Bằng was an ongoing campaign in northern Indochina during the First Indochina War, between the French Far East Expeditionary Corps and the Việt Minh, which began in October 1947 and culminated on September 3, 1949. Since the start of the conflict, Việt Minh troops had ambushed French convoys along the Vietnam–China border from the Gulf of Tonkin on a 147-mile route to a French garrison at Cao Bằng, known as Route Colonial 4, or RC4. Repeated ambushes led to repeated French operations of increasing strength to reopen the road, including a costly mission by the Foreign Legion in February 1948. On July 25, 1948, the Cao Bằng encampment was itself attacked and held out for three days with two companies defending against two battalions of Việt Minh. A further 28 ambushes took place in 1948.Windrow, pp. 103–107.
In February 1949, five Việt Minh battalions and mortar units took a French post at Lào Cai, and resumed ambushes through the monsoon season. On September 3, 1949, 100 vehicles left That Khe in a reinforced convoy which travelled a distance of [tpl]convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] through infantry screens. The French, reduced to one soldier per vehicle due to troop numbers, were ambushed by automatic fire. The first twenty trucks were halted, as were the final ten, and the middle of the convoy was cut down by shellfire. The following day, French troops reoccupied the surrounded hilltops, however only four French wounded were found alive.
The campaign at Cao Bằng resulted in a change in convoy practices for the remainder of the war. Vehicles thereafter travelled from post to post in 10-12 vehicle convoys, through security screens of French troops and with aircraft observation. Through 1950, supply convoys to Cao Bằng were discontinued in favour of air supply.2006 Page 166 ".. se laissaient facilement piéger et essuyaient revers sur revers, en particulier celui de Cao Bằng en septembre 1950 qui eut un effet retentissant en France."

The climate of Europe is of a temperate, continental nature, with a maritime climate prevailing on the western coasts and a Mediterranean climate in the south.  The climate is strongly conditioned by the Gulf Stream, which keeps mild air over the high latitude northwestern region over the winter months, especially in Ireland, the UK and coastal Norway.  Whilst Western Europe has an oceanic climate, Eastern Europe has a drier, continental climate. Parts of the Central European plains have a hybrid oceanic/continental climate. Four seasons occur in Eastern Europe, while southern Europe experiences distinct wet season and dry seasons, with prevailing hot and dry conditions during the summer months.  The heaviest precipitation occurs downwind of water bodies due to the prevailing westerlies, with higher amounts also seen in the Alps. Tornadoes occur within Europe, with most but not all occurrences being weak.  The Netherlands and United Kingdom experience a disproportionately high number of tornadic events.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

[[Strike package]]

CATEGORIES: Military aviation

A strike package is a group of aircraft with different capabilities that are launched together to perform a single attack mission.  The US Navy refers to the same concept as an alpha strike.
The term is normally applied to ground attack missions, where the strike package will include the bombers attacking the primary target, fighters to defend them from enemy aircraft, wild weasels to defend against ground based anti-aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft for pre- and post-raid analysis, and tanker aircraft to keep them all in the air. In some cases all of these roles can be carried out by a single aircraft with different payloads, but it is more common to use a variety of different aircraft, launched from different locations and times.

[[Berry's Green]]

CATEGORIES: Areas of London, Districts of Bromley

Berry's Green is a small area in the London Borough of Bromley in London, UK. It is a fairly wooded rural area with a scattering of farmland.  Housing consists mainly of detached properties, mostly bungalows, with a row of local authority cottages and a static mobile home site. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a sub-post office on the corner of Single Street and Jail Lane which sold basic provisions, such as bread, milk, sweets, and crisps. Mains sewerage was installed in around 1973.
On the junction of Jail Lane, Berry's Hill, and Berry's Green Road is a small wood with large World War II bomb crater. This may have been caused by a V-2 rocket as it is almost the same distance from Germany as the last known V-2, which was dropped in Kynaston Rd, Orpington. A lot of the V-2s fell short of London towards the end of the war. There are also a number of smaller bomb craters scattered around the surrounding woodlands, due to its proximity to Biggin Hill airfield. Berry's Green is home to the Cherry Lodge Golf Course.

[[WeCU Technologies]]
CATEGORIES: Information technology companies of Israel

WeCU Technologies (as in "we see you") is a technology company based in Israel that is developing a "mind reading" technology for the purpose of detecting terrorists at airports. The company's products evaluate reactions to specific images for indications that someone is a potential threat.
The technology involves projecting an image that only a terrorist would be likely to recognize onto a screen. The idea is that people always react when they see a familiar image in an unexpected location. For example, if a person unexpectedly saw an image of their own mother on the screen, their face and body would react. For the terrorist detection, the people passing by the screen would be monitored partly by humans, but mostly by hidden cameras or sensors that are capable of detecting slight increases in body temperature and heart rate. Other detection devices, which are more sensitive and currently under development, could be added later.Mind-reading systems could change air security, The Kansas City Star, January 8, 2010
The bank of images used for projection is varied and unpredictable, as is the location where the images will appear, so even trained suspects who are aware of the system can still be detected.Israel startup uses behavioral science to identify terrorists, Haaretz, September 5, 2008

[[International Grooving & Grinding Association]]
CATEGORIES: Companies based in New York

The International Grooving & Grinding Association (IGGA) is a non-profit trade association founded in 1972 that represents the industry that performs grooving and grinding of both concrete and asphalt surfaces in addition to Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) and Concrete Pavement Preservation (CPP) methods. CPR and CPP methods are a series of engineered techniques developed during the last 40 years to manage the rate of pavement deterioration in concrete streets, highways and airports. A non-overlay option used to repair areas of distress in concrete pavement without changing its grade, CPR restores the pavement to a condition close to or better than original and reduces the need for major and more costly repairs later. CPP/CPR addresses the cause of pavement distress, minimizing further deterioration. Covering road distress with an asphalt overlay does not correct the cause and will eventually manifest itself again, usually as a larger, more expensive problem. Asphalt overlays typically last eight to 12 years, whereas CPP and CPR last up to 30 years.Roads & BridgesStates talk strategy on pavement restoration: more and more, state DOTs are taking action to preserve their concrete pavements. Concrete Paving Today, Better Roads. Pages 4a-8a.
In 1995, the IGGA joined in affiliation with the American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) to represent its newly formed CPR Division. The IGGA/ACPA CPR Division now serves as the technical resource and industry representative in the marketing of optimized pavement surfaces, CPR and pavement preservation globally. As of 2009, the IGGA had more than 60 members. 
The IGGA is made up of contractors, manufacturers, suppliers, consultants and public officials representing all facets of the industry. In addition to a diversified Board of Directors, the IGGA is served by a Communications Committee whose activities include public relations, development of marketing materials and industry promotion. The Environmental Committee is in place to research and educate the industry about key issues affecting the marketplace.IGGAConcrete Monthly

[[Stephen the Hymnographer]]

CATEGORIES: Byzantine hymnographers, Eastern Orthodox saints, 807 deaths, 725 births

Saint Stephen the Hymnographer (725–807), also known as Stephen of St. Sabas, was a Syrian monk who is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church.
Stephen lived the ascetic life at the Lavra of Saint Sabas in Palestine. He was the nephew of St. John Damascene.[ref]
</ref>
Stephen was introduced to the monastic life by his uncle, and, at the age of ten, entered the same monastic community as his uncle. By his mid-twenties, he felt so drawn to a life of seclusion and contemplation, he asked the abbot of the community for permission to live as a hermit. Due to the great skill in giving spiritual direction he already showed at that young age, the abbot gave him limited permission. The condition was that he make himself available to others on weekends.http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/SaintofDay/default.aspx/ Saint of the Day
He and Andrew the Blind were among the first to compose hymns (idiomela) in the Triodion (the liturgical book used during Great Lent), chanted during the period between the Sunday of the Publican and Pharisee and Palm Sunday. These idiomela are stichera of which two were written for each weekday of Great Lent. One is chanted at the aposticha of Vespers and one at the aposticha of Matins, each being chanted twice. The idiomela are "exceptionally rich in doctrinal content, summing up the whole theology of the Great Fast".
His feast day is celebrated on October 28 on the Liturgical calendar of the Orthodox Church (for those Orthodox Churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, October 28 falls on November 10 of the modern Gregorian Calendar).

Songs that were still in the top 10 at the beginning of 2010 but peaked in 2009 are listed in List of top 10 singles in 2009 (UK). Songs that entered the top 10 in 2010 but did not peak until 2011 will be listed in List of top 10 singles in 2011 (UK). An asterisk (*) in the "Weeks in Top 10" column shows that the song is in the top 10 as of 26 December 2010 and therefore the number of weeks could change. For the current top 10, see 2010 in British music.

The Battle of the Day River (French: bataille du Day) took place between late May and early June 1951, around the Day River Delta in the Gulf of Tonkin. Part of the First Indochina War, the battle was the first conventional campaign of Vo Nguyen Giap, and saw his Viet Minh forces tackle the Catholic-dominated region of the Delta in order to break its resistance to Viet Minh infiltration. On the back of two defeats at similar ventures through March and April that year, Giap led three divisions in a pattern of guerilla and diversion attacks on Ninh Binh, Nam Dinh, Phu Ly and Phat Diem beginning on May 30. The French army, under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, who lost his son in the first day of the battle at Ninh Binh, mobilised several armoured brigades, and the ebb and flow of captured and retaken positions continued until Giap's supply lines were cut around June 6. His forces, moving in large numbers and during daylight, were vulnerable to French firepower and to French ground forces supported by friendly local militia. The Viet Minh were forced into withdrawing between June 10 and June 18, leaving 1,000 prisoners to the French and 9,000 casualties.Windrow, p. 114-115.Fall, Street Without Joy, p. 45.

The 1997 TFL Statewide League premiership season was an Australian rules football competition, staged across Tasmania, Australia over twenty (20) roster rounds and six (6) finals series matches between 12 April and 20 September 1997.

This was the twelfth season of statewide football and the League was known as the Cascade-Boags Draught Super League under a dual commercial naming-rights sponsorship agreement with both Cascade Brewery in Hobart and Boag's Brewery in Launceston.
 
At the conclusion of this season four clubs left the competition owing to severe financial problems.
 
Hobart, in debt to the tune of $450,000, were already advised by TFL executives that they would not be granted a renewed license to continue on in the TFL after this season and decided to join the SFL from 1998, both South Launceston and Launceston continued to find onfield success minimal and were also servicing large debts that looked likely to continue to grow and promptly pulled out of the competition and rejoined the NTFL from 1998 whilst Sandy Bay, unable to find a merger partner, was wound up at season's end and became defunct.

The party was founded in Lvov in November 1931 by a leftwing group of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland in East Galicia, which upheld the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat, a faction of the Poale Zion Left and young left-wing Zionists. The party was aligned with the Communist Party of Poland.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 318Marcus, Joseph. Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939. Berlin: Mouton Publishers, 1983. p. 284
The party was led by Zigmunt Stein.http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/sambor/samxix.html
The party was banned in July 1934, a move welcomed by mainstream Jewish leaders in East Galicia. Several activists of the party were imprisoned for being members of the party. The party later merged into the Communist Party of Poland.

The Ottofels ("Otto Rock"), named after Prince Otto of Stolberg-Wernigerode, is a tor and natural monument near Wernigerode in the Harz mountains of central Germany.
The Ottofels or Ottofelsen lie about 2.5 km southwest of Hasserode in the borough of Wernigerode. It can only be reached on foot, either from the Steinerne Renne halt on the Harz Railway and Brocken Railway or from the car park at the junction of the Thumkuhle and Dränge valleys not far from the road to Drei Annen Hohne.
The rocks stand at a height of 584 metres above sea level and are 36 metres high. They are made of coarse-grained granite and have been weathered to form a tor. On 27 July 1892 there was a ceremony to mark the completion of public access to the top, which consisted of several iron ladders. These ladders were replaced after the Wende in 1990. In addition the Ottofels is used for rock climbing by mountaineers.
From the summit there is a panoramic view of the mountains and valleys of the Harz as far as its highest peak, the Brocken, and far over the northern Harz Foreland.
The Ottofels is checkpoint no. 27 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

The Budapest Opera Ball (Budapesti Operabál in Hungarian, Budapester Opernball in German) is an annual Hungarian society event taking place in the building of the Budapest Opera (Operaház) on the last Saturday of the carnival season, usually late February.http://www.operabal.com/eng/operabal_tortenete.html On this occasion the stage and the auditorium of the Opera is transformed into a huge ballroom. The dress code is evening dress: white tie and tails for men; floor-length gowns for women. The ball is opened by more than a hundred debutante dancers after a show consisting of selected arias, followed by the 'Alles Walzer' with people dancing until dawn. Recent star guests include Montserrat Caballé, Ornella Muti, Yevgeny Nesterenko, Walter Berry, Heinz Zednik, Katia Ricciarelli, Patrizio Buanne, Catherine Deneuve, Katarina Witt, Gina Lollobrigida, Daryl Hannah and Guy de Rothschild. Besides international guests, the balls are highlighted by the most well known Hungarian opera singers.
The Opera Ball was first organised on March 2, 1886.http://www.jagellobusinesshotel.hu/en/Programmes_in_Budapest/Opera_Ball.html Suspended in 1934, it was not revived until 1996. Representing a tradition rooted in 1880's era Austrian-Hungarian culture, the revival has become the most prestigious meeting point of the participants of the Hungarian public life, fully covered by national media.
In 2011, the Opera Ball was substituted with a charity Gala Concert as a gesture "of contribution to the work of the Government, the leading institutions and the citizens" to help those Hungarians afflicted by the ongoing financial crisis and the various natural disasters.http://index.hu/kultur/2011/01/06/elmarad_az_operabal/

Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), commonly known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium at the base of the stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.

[[1911 Michigan Wolverines football team]]

CATEGORIES: 1911 NCAA football season, Michigan Wolverines football seasons, 1911 in Michigan

The 1911 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1911 college football season. The team's head coach was Fielding H. Yost in his 11th season at Michigan. The Wolverines compiled a record of 5–1–2 and outscored their opponents 90 to 38.
After beginning the season with four consecutive wins, the team was stricken with multiple injuries and won only one of its final four games, an 11–9 victory over Penn in the annual rivalry game with the Quakers.  The team's sole loss was to Cornell in a game in which halfback Jimmy Craig, quarterback Shorty McMillan, and lineman Miller Pontius were all sidelined with injuries. As the injuries mounted, the Detroit Free Press quipped in late November 1911 that Michigan could claim the world championship of injuries, having had more injuries in 1911 than ever before in the program's history.
Only one Michigan player received All-American honors in 1911.  Stanfield Wells, who played three games at right end and three at right halfback, was selected as a first-team All-American by the The New York Globe and Henry L. Williams.  Two other players on the 1911 team, Pontius and Craig received All-American honors in 1912 or 1913.
Four Michigan players were recognized as first-team All-Western players.  They were Wells, team captain Frederick L. Conklin, fullback and punter George "Bottles" Thomson, and Craig.  Thomson was also the team's high scorer with seven touchdowns in seven games for a total of 35 points.

In geometric graph theory, a branch of mathematics, a matchstick graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane in such a way that its edges are line segments with length one that do not cross each other. That is, it is a graph that has an embedding which is simultaneously a unit distance graph and a plane graph. Informally, matchstick graphs can be made by placing noncrossing matchsticks on a flat surface, hence the name.[tpl]mathworld|MatchstickGraph[/tpl]

The 2010 San Francisco 49ers season was the franchise's 65th season, their 61st in the National Football League, and the second full year with Mike Singletary as the head coach. The 49ers were looking to build upon their 8–8 season in 2009.
However the 49ers began the season with a disastrous 0–5 start and would end up with a losing record of 6–10 as their postseason jinx continued. The 49ers originally retained Jimmy Raye as the offensive coordinator, marking the first time since Greg Knapp in 2003 that the 49ers had the same offensive coordinator for more than one season. However, after starting the season with three straight losses, the 49ers fired Raye and promoted Quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson to offensive coordinator.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.csnbayarea.com/09/27/10/Report-49ers-Fire-Jimmy-Raye/landing.html?blockID=319139&feedID=2478 | title=49ers Fire Offensive Coordinator Jimmy Raye | author=Matt Maiocco | publisher=CSN Bay Area | accessdate=2010-09-27 [/tpl] Ultimately head coach Singletary would himself be fired before the last game of the season.

The Wolverines compiled a record of 6–1, outscored opponents 116 to 34, and held six of seven opponents to six points or less.
The team began its season with four consecutive victories, including close calls against [tpl]cfb link|year=1909|team=Case Western Reserve Spartans|school=Case Western Reserve University|title=Case[/tpl] (3–0) and [tpl]cfb link|year=1909|team=Marquette Golden Avalanche|title=Marquette[/tpl] (6–5) and dominating performances against [tpl]cfb link|year=1909|team=Ohio State Buckeyes|title=Ohio State[/tpl] (33–6) and [tpl]cfb link|year=1909|team=Syracuse Orange|title=Syracuse[/tpl] (44–0).  The team's sole setback came in the fifth game, losing to Notre Dame (11–3) for the first time in nine games between them. Following the game, a Detroit newspaper described Notre Dame's predominantly Irish-American lineup as a group of "Fighting Irishmen," giving birth to the team's nickname.
The Wolverines then finished the season with impressive road victories over two of the best teams in the country.  In Philadelphia, they defeated the 1908 national champion [tpl]cfb link|year=1909|team=Penn Quakers|title=Penn Quakers[/tpl], 12–6, breaking the Quakers' 23-game winning streak.  In Minneapolis, they defeated the previously unbeaten 1909 Western Conference champions from Minnesota, 15–6.  The 1909 Minnesota game was the first game played for possession of the Little Brown Jug, the oldest rivalry trophy in college football.
Several players from the 1909 Michigan team received recognition for their performance.  Left guard Albert Benbrook was the first Western lineman (and the fifth Western player at any position) to be selected as a first-team All-American by Walter Camp.  Both of Michigan's halfbacks, Dave Allerdice and Joe Magidsohn, were chosen by Camp as second-team All-Americans and also received first-team honors on Walter Eckersall's All-Western team in the Chicago Daily Tribune.  Allerdice, who was the 1909 team captain, also received first-team All-American honors from The New York Times and syndicated sports columnist Tommy Clark.  Magidsohn was the first Jewish athlete to win a varsity "M" at the University of Michigan.  Andrew Smith was also named the first-team All-Western center, despite having only moved to the position for the last two games of the season.

[[Khalid ibn Abi Habib al-Fihri]]
CATEGORIES: Umayyad generals, Berber Revolt, 8th-century rulers, 740 deaths, People killed in action, Year of birth unknown

Khalid ibn Abi Habib al-Fihri (?-October, 740) was an Arab military commander in North Africa during the Berber Revolt, who led the Arab army that was defeated at the Battle of the Nobles in late 740. 
The chronicles are oddly ambiguous on the biographical details of Khalid ibn Abi Habib.  It is acknowledged (e.g. Ibn Khaldun, p. 360) that he was a member of the illustrious Fihrid family,  the cream of the cream, descendants of the great Arab conqueror Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri.  The patronymic structure suggests Khalid is the son of the father of Habib, which would imply that it is likely Khalid was the brother of Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri, the principal military commander of Ifriqiya.  But this is not confirmed.If it is indeed true that Khalid and Habib were brothers, then their different patronyms (Ibn Abi Habib and Ibn Abi Obeida respectively) might have been introduced merely as a convenient distinguishing device to avoid confusing the brothers.  Abu Habib and Abu Obeida are the same person - their father (cf. Fihrid family).  However, in his chronicle, Ibn Khaldun, departs momentarily from this usage and writes (p.360) that 'Ibn Abi Obeida' fell at the Battle of the Nobles.  This is not an error but technically correct (as Abu Obeid was indeed Khalid's father).  Nonetheless, this seems to have led some careless readers to assume Ibn Khaldun meant Habib and consequently confuse the Battle of the Nobles (Khalid's death, 740) with the Battle of Bagdoura (Habib's death, 741).
When the Berber Revolt of Maysara al-Matghari broke out in Morocco in 740, the bulk of the Ifriqiyan army, under the commander Habib ibn Abi Obeida al-Fihri was overseas, on campaign in Sicily.  The governor of Ifriqiya Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab immediately dispatched instructions to Habib break off the expedition and ship the army back to Africa.  But this would take time, and the rebels had, in the meantime, taken Tangiers and seized the whole length of Morocco.  To keep the Berber rebels in check until the Sicilian expedition army returned, Obeid Allah assembled a cavalry-heavy column composed largely of the aristocratic Arab elite of Kairouan, and placed it under the command of Khalid ibn Abi Habib.  This column was dispatched immediately to Tangiers and instructed to serve as the vanguard until the Sicilian expeditionary force under Habib disembarked and caught up with them.
Khalid ibn Abi Habib encountered the Berber rebel army in the outskirts of Tangiers, and after a couple of skirmishes, forced them to pull back.  As per the instructions he was given, Khalid held his position south of Tangiers, awaiting the reinforcements from Sicily.  But before junction could be made, the Berber rebel army, under a new commander, Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati, fell upon the Arab column in October/November 740.  Khalid ibn Abi Habib and his column, the flower of the Ifriqiyan nobility, was annihilated by the Berbers in what became known as the Battle of the Nobles.

[[1908 Michigan Wolverines football team]]
CATEGORIES: 1908 Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States football season, Michigan Wolverines football seasons, 1908 in Michigan

The 1908 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1908 college football season. The team's head coach was Fielding H. Yost in his eighth year at Michigan.  The team compiled a 5–2–1 record, outscored opponents 128 to 81, and held five of seven opponents to six points or less.  After opening the season with a 5–0–1 record, and allowing an average of four points per game, the Wolverines lost badly in back-to-back games against the 1908 national champion Penn Quakers (29–0) and [tpl]cfb link|year=1908|team=Syracuse Orange|title=Syracuse[/tpl] (28–4).
Team captain and center Germany Schulz was academically ineligible for the first three games of the season, but his performance in the Penn game, withstanding the attack of multiple Penn players focused on knocking him out of the game, was told and re-told by sports writers for decades after the 1908 season had ended.  In 1951, Schulz was selected as the greatest center in football history in a poll conducted by the National Football Foundation and became one of the initial inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame.
Right halfback Dave Allerdice, who also handled punting and place-kicking responsibilities for Michigan, was the team's leading scorer with 64 points (exactly half of the team's total), despite missing the final game of the season with a broken collarbone.   Allerdice also led the 1909 team in scoring and was a first-team All-American that year.  Fullback Sam Davison scored six touchdowns in the team's November 1908 victory over Kentucky State.  Davison's total is tied for second in Michigan history for the most touchdowns in a game, trailing Albert Herrnstein's seven touchdowns against the Michigan Aggies in 1902.

CATEGORIES: Michigan Wolverines football seasons, 1906 Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States football season, 1906 in Michigan

The 1906 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan in the 1906 college football season. The team's head coach was Fielding H. Yost in his sixth year at Michigan.   The team compiled a record of 4–1 and outscored opponents, 72 to 30.
The 1906 season was played under two sets of new rules.  First, the rules governing intercollegiate were changed to promote a more "open" and less dangerous style of play.  The changes included the legalization of the forward pass and allowing the punting team to recover an "on-side" kick as a live ball.  Second, the Big Nine Conference enacted new rules, including a rule limiting teams to five games (a drastic reduction from the 13 games played by Michigan in 1905) and prohibitions on the "training table" and pre-season training before the start of the academic year.
Also before the season began, university officials ruled that two of the stars from the 1905 team, Germany Schulz and Walter Rheinschild, were academically ineligible to compete in football.  Despite the setbacks, Michigan won its first four games by a combined score of 72 to 13.  The season opener against Case Scientific School was the first game played on the new Ferry Field.  During the bye week before the final game of the season, Michigan's captain Joe Curtis sustained a severely broken leg in a practice game against the "scrub" team.  The Wolverines lost their final game to the Penn Quakers, 17–0, at Philadelphia's Franklin Field.
Two Michigan players, Joe Curtis and fullback John Garrels, were selected as first-team All-Western players.  Garrels, who had broken world records in the discus throw and the high hurdles, was also selected as a second-team All-American by Walter Camp.

[[Liggett Hall]]
CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Manhattan

Liggett Hall is a former barracks building designed by McKim, Mead & White and built in 1929 at Fort Jay on Governors Island, a long time U.S. Army post and administrative center in New York Harbor. The Georgian Revival building follows a design from a master plan for Fort Jay that the architectural firm developed for the island post at the request of Secretary of War Elihu Root in 1904. The overall plan was never executed but inspired designs by other architectural firms, whether augmenting the barracks or constructing Works Progress Administration projects in the mid-1930s, including the post hospital, corps area headquarters, officer's family and non-commission officers family housing.
Influenced by the regimental barracks of France that the U.S. Army used in World War I, the barracks was the first of three large barracks complexes constructed between the world wars by the army to house an entire regiment. The two others were "The Curatels," larger than Liggett Hall and built between 1930 and 1939 at Fort Benning Georgia; and "The Castle," a 1,285-man barracks at McChord Army Airbase constructed in 1940.
The need for Liggett Hall was dire in the 1920s. Temporary wood barracks and old warehouses remaining from World War I housed the 16th Infantry Regiment (United States) the garrison for the post from 1922 to 1941. Repeatedly reported as substandard and subject to several destructive fires through the 1920s, funds were finally appropriated for its construction in 1928–29. While the need for the barracks was never in question, the intention behind the alignment of the 400-yard-long building across the middle of Governors Island has been.
The island was under consideration for some time by City of New York as a small, 2000-foot-long downtown airport or airstrip.Governors Island But as laid out, the building stretches across the center of the island for almost half its width, thwarting the possibility of building a runway; the proposal finally became moot in the 1930s when federal government aviation regulations required airport runways to be 3000 feet in length, together with construction of LaGuardia Airport in Queens. Today, Liggett Hall is centerpiece of Governors Island Park. Unsympathetic additions have been removed to create Liggett Terrace, a multi-use plaza connecting the island's historic northeastern section with its southwestern expanse, the latter cleared of later structures to create parkland.Liggett Terrace, Governors Island Park

The song was performed sixth on the night, following Portugal's Eduardo Nascimento with "O vento mudou" and preceding Sweden's Östen Warnerbring with "Som en dröm". At the close of voting, it received no points and was placed 17th (last place).
The song is a ballad in which Géraldine asks a former lover whose heart he is going to break now that hers no longer beats for him. She tells him that she has forgotten him and asks him who will be the next victim of his false passions.
The song was succeeded as Swiss representative at the 1968 Contest by Gianni Mascolo performing "Guardando il sole".

When ventilating a patient with a (FROPVD) you must ensure an adequate, constant oxygen supply is available. Once the oxygen source is depleted, the device can no longer be used because it is driven completely by an oxygen source. The device must have a pressure relief valve that opens at 60cm of water pressure to avoid over ventilation and trauma to the lungs.

Floyd August "Gib" Guilbeau (born September 26, 1937) is an American Cajun country-rock musician and songwriter. As a member of Nashville West, Swampwater, and the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau helped pioneer the fusion of rock and country music in the 1960s.
Guilbeau was born in Sunset, Louisiana and raised among fiddle players. His father and brothers played fiddle, and he himself started playing fiddle at the age of fourteen.[tpl]cite web |url= http://members.chello.at/thomas.aubrunner/gib.htm|title= Gib Guilbeau|author= Thomas Aubrunner|date= January 20, 2009|work= |publisher= |accessdate=January 23, 2010[/tpl]
In 1960, Guilbeau formed The Four Young Men with guitarist Wayne Moore, which Bobby Edwards then joined to become Bobby Edwards & the Four Young Men. Together, they release the single "You're the Reason", which became a nationwide hit, peaking at #4 Country and #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961.
In 1967, Guilbeau formed Nashville West, a short-lived country-rock group with multi-instrumentalist Gene Parsons, who had played with Guilbeau in a band called the Castaways years earlier, guitarist Clarence White, formerly of the Kentucky Colonels, and Wayne Moore on bass. Along with bands such as the Byrds, Dillard & Clark and the International Submarine Band, Nashville West was one of the first country-rock bands. Country-rock notables such as Gram Parsons and future Flying Burrito Brother Sneaky Pete Kleinow would sit in with the group. They also provided backing for other groups, such as the Gosdin Brothers and The Hollywood Argyles. Nashville West came to an end in 1968 when Gram Parsons abruptly left the Byrds and the group asked Clarence White to replace him.
In 1969, Guilbeau played in the group Swampwater, originally formed to back Linda Ronstadt following the breakup of the Stone Poneys. Swampwater played a unique brand of Cajun rock that had no precedents in rock music. Swampwater recorded two albums before they broke up.
In 1972, Guilbeau contributed to the soundtrack for the Martin Scorsese film Boxcar Bertha.
In 1974, Guilbeau, along with Gene Parsons and original members Chris Ethridge and Sneaky Pete Kleinow, formed a latter-day version of the Flying Burrito Brothers. The band underwent many personnel changes, performing and recording sporadically into the 1990s.
As a songwriter, Guilbeau's songs have been covered by many artists, including Ricky Nelson, Bobby Womack, Ronnie Wood, and Rod Stewart.[tpl]cite web |url= [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p79924|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title= Songs Composed By Gib Guilbeau|author= |date= |work= |publisher= Allmusic|accessdate=January 30, 2010[/tpl]

[[Ophiocistioidea]]

CATEGORIES: Echinoderms

The Ophiocistioidea is a class of extinct echinoderms from the Palaeozoic. 
Ophiocistioids had a flattened dome-shaped body encased in a solid test of calcareous plates, similar to that of a modern sea urchin. The mouth was located at the apex of the dome, and surrounded by a set of five jaws. The animals apparently did not possess an anus, but a madreporite was present on the upper surface, surrounded by what appear to be genital pores for the release of gametes. 
Five ambulacra radiated outwards from the mouth across the upper surface, but did not extend onto the flat underside. Each possessed three unusually large tube feet at the margin of the dome. Unlike normal tube feet, these were covered in small bony scales, and therefore remain visible in fossils.

Charles John Kleibacker (November 20, 1921 – January 3, 2010) was an American fashion designer who earned the nickname "Master of the Bias" for the complex designs of his gowns for women, carefully cut from fabric at a diagonal to the weave.
Kleibacker was born in Cullman, Alabama on November 20, 1921. His family were the proprietors of a department store in the municipality. He attended the University of Notre Dame, where he majored in journalism, and worked for a time as a reporter for a newspaper in Alabama. He attended New York University for his graduate studies.Wilson, Eric. "Charles Kleibacker, Fashion Designer, Dies at 88", The New York Times, January 7, 2010. Accessed January 8, 2010.
While working at a clothing store in San Francisco, Kleibacker met singer Hildegarde and her manager Anna Sosenko at the hotel in which he was staying. He was hired as her driver, primarily because he owned a station wagon large enough to transport the singer's sizable entourage. On tour in Europe, Kleibacker met numerous fashion designers and came to the conclusion that he had an interest in the field while in the offices of Christian Dior. He submitted a series of his early designs while in Paris in 1954, and earned a post as an assistant at Lanvin. Back in New York City in 1957, Kleibacker worked for Nettie Rosenstein.

The Schnütgen Museum (Museum Schnütgen in German) in Cologne (Köln), Germany is devoted to Christian religious art, mainly medieval, but some parts of the collection, such as its textiles and prints, extend from antiquity to the modern period.  In 1906, the collection of Alexander Schnütgen was donated to the city, and the collection has continued to expand, so that until the opening of a new building in 2010, only about 10% of its 13,000 items could be displayed. Now some 2,000 objects are on display in 1900 sq. metres of gallery space, with an additional 1300 sq. metres for special exhibitions.Museum website, English page, accessed May 10, 2005  Schnütgen (1843–1918) was a Catholic priest and theologian;Biography on German Wikipedia according to the museum website "Up to now people tell stories about his zealous and sometimes crafty collection tactics".Museums of Cologne Art of the Middle Ages Museum Schnütgen.

Panayiotou and others v Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd. (1994 ChD 142) was a contract and entertainment law case before the High Court of Justice's Chancery Division. The plaintiff, entertainer George Michael, argued that his recording contract constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Michael alleged that the defendant had failed to promote his album Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 with due vigor as punishment when the artist decided to downplay his status as a sex symbol. Michael described his situation as "professional slavery" because his contract required that he produce music and cede the copyright to Sony for many years, leaving him no control over how the music would be marketed nor placing a reciprocal requirement that the label invest in promotion. Had the case succeeded, it might have curtailed the practice of signing artists to multi-album contracts. The court wholly rejected the claims.

Hill, George Pruitt, "The Ultimate Trading Guide" New York Wiley 2000 ISBN 978-0-471-38135-8 The method establishes support and resistance areas in multiple time periods and uses these to determine high probability trading areas.David Keller, "Breakthroughs in Technical Analysis; New Thinking from the World's Top Minds", 2007, New York, Bloomberg Press ISBN 978-1-57660-242-3
Drummond geometry consists of the following:Paul Leo and Peter Temple, "The Ultimate Technical Trading Software", 2003, New York, Wiley Publishing, ISBN 978-0-470-82084-1
Typical timeframes vary according to the trader's goal:
Daily, weekly, monthly for swing traders
Daily, Monthly, quarterly and yearly for long-term position traders.
15-minute, hourly, and daily for intraday traders
The usual moving average length for the envelopes and midline is 3-periods.
The method also relies on a moving average based on the "PL Dot". The formula for the PL Dot is the average of the high, low, and close of the last three bars, displaced forward one bar:
"Mapping Future Activity", by Ted Hearne, ChartPoint Magazine (Singapore) March 2002[/ref]
Each completed bar generates a new PL dot and this series of dots form a moving average, which is plotted either as a continuous line or as an individual dot on each bar. Both the dot itself and the moving average formed by the dots are by convention called the "PL Dot."

Sarah McFarland Taylor is an American academic and author. She is currently Associate Professor of Religion in the Department of Religious Studies at Northwestern University, where she also teaches in the Environmental Policy and Culture Program. Areas of focus include women's studies in religion, religion and ecology, and religion and American culture.
Taylor has held numerous fellowships, including the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation Career Enhancement Fellowship, a Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowship, a Wabash Center Fellowship, and a Louisville Institute Fellowship.Northwestern University faculty profile For the 2008-2009 school year, she held the Senior Research Fellowship at the Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion at the University of Chicago Divinity School.Marty Martin Center for the Advanced Study of Religion
Her 2007 book Green Sisters: A Spiritual Ecology won two awards from the Catholic Press Association for Best Book on Gender Issues as well as Best Book on Social Concerns. Published by the Harvard University press, Green Sisters highlights Roman Catholic religious sisters who have taken up environmental activism,[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]</ref> including the [[Dominican Sisters]]' Genesis Farm, the Green Mountain Monastery, [[White Violet Center for Eco-Justice]] of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]], and the Sisters of the Presentation straw-bale welcome center.
In "What If Religions Had Ecologies?: The Case for Reinhabiting Religious Studies" (Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture, Summer 2007), Taylor argues that meaningful connections need to be forged between the literary realm of ecocriticism and religious studies, and more attention needs to be paid to the natural history of the physical environments that religious communities inhabit and to how those communities shape and are in turn shaped by those environments. When physical environments are considered as integral parts of academic religious inquiry and no longer rendered invisible or relegated to mere ‘backdrops’ for the larger human drama, contends Taylor, scholars will be able to provide a more nuanced sense of religion as it is truly lived in context. Taylor continues to theorize the concept of "spiritual ecology" in her work.
The author currently has two books in process: Eternally Green: American Religion and the Ecology of Death, which looks at the green burial movement, and Eco-Prophecy: Religious Responses to Global Climate Change.

[[Discrete Fourier series]]

CATEGORIES: Fourier analysis

A Fourier series is a representation of a function in terms of a summation of an infinite number of harmonically-related sinusoids with different amplitudes and phases.  The amplitude and phase of a sinusoid can be combined into a single complex number, called a Fourier coefficient.  The Fourier series is a periodic function.  So it cannot represent any arbitrary function.  It can represent either:
When the function being represented, whether finite-length or periodic, is discrete, the Fourier series coefficients are periodic, and can therefore be described by a finite set of complex numbers.  That set is called a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is subsequently an overloaded term, because we don't know whether its (periodic) inverse transform is valid over a finite or an infinite interval.  The term discrete Fourier series (DFS) is intended for use in lieu of DFT when the original function is periodic, defined over an infinite interval.  DFT would then unambiguously imply only a transform whose inverse is valid over a finite interval.  But we must again note that a Fourier series is a time-domain representation, not a frequency domain transform.  So DFS is a potentially confusing substitute for DFT.  A more technically valid description would be DFS coefficients.

The Lord of the Rings film series is a series of epic fantasy-drama films directed by Peter Jackson.

[[History and Future of Justice]]
CATEGORIES: Ethics books

History and Future of Justice is a book of philosopher and political scientist Vojin Rakic. It advocates the thesis that history is marked by a slow but progressive development of justice. Rakic believes that the 'end of history' will be marked by a condition of perfect freedom and perfect justice. He asserts that, in spite of all the tragic and inhumane events in our history, a view of the overall historical development of humanity reveals a progress from epochs in which only some were free (e.g., Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Middle Ages) to periods in which liberal and democratic concepts are gradually suppressing extremely inegalitarian and authoritarian regime types. The historical development of freedom in humanity Rakic believes to translate in the development of the opportunity of humans to act in a just manner on the basis of their free will. A topical book influenced by History and Future of Justice is The Evolution of God by Robert Wright (see Wright, 2009). For a recent article that applies the ideas from History and Future of Justice to the moral evolution of humanity as a follow-up of its physical evolution, see Rakic (2009).

[[Colourist painting]]
CATEGORIES: Modern art

Colourist painting is characterised by the use of intense colour, which becomes the dominant feature of the resultant work of art, more important than its other qualities. This tendency in painting was foreshadowed by French Impressionism in the late 19th century, and came to prominence in the work of the Fauvists in the early 20th century. It has since surfaced in a variety of individual styles and art movements, outside France as well, the most prominent being the Scottish Colourists, the Polish Colourists (a.k.a. Kapists), or the American abstract Color Field painters. Pierre Bonnard, among others, was a colorist painter.

The Volga Cossacks participated in Yermak's conquest of Siberia. Due to the creation of the Tsaritsyn fortified line in the 18th century, the central government decided to form the Volga Cossack Host (Волгское казачье войско) consisting of 1057 families (mostly Don Cossacks) with the center in Dubovka (north of Tsaritsyn). The Volga Cossacks participated in the Pugachev Rebellion in 1773-1775.
In 1770 and 1777 the majority of the Volga Cossacks were relocated to the North Caucasus to form the Mozdok and Volga regiments of the Terek Cossack Host. The Volga Cossack Host proper was abolished. The remnants of the Volga Cossack Host were merged with the Astrakhan Cossack Host in the early 19th century.

Margaret Patricia Hughes (1 October 1919 – 30 January 2005) was a sportswriter.
Her first book, All On A Summer's Day (1953), was described by Neville Cardus in his foreword to the book as "the first book on first-class cricket not written by a man".
Margaret was brought up in Kent, one of four children of Dorothy Maude and Arthur Hughes.  She worked for the advertising department of the Star newspaper, taking the job "to see the cricket scores before the general public".  During World War II she served as a Wren.  She then resumed her newspaper career and became a close friend of Cardus.  He bequeathed her his copyrights.
Following All On A Summer's Day, she covered the Ashes series of 1954–55 for the Sydney Daily telegraph, the only woman ever to cover an Ashes series for a daily newspaper until Chloe Saltau did so in 2005.  Her tour diary was published as The Long Hop (1955).

CATEGORIES: Dimensional instruments

Plastigauge is a measuring tool used for measuring plain bearing clearances, such as engines. Other uses include marine drive shaft bearings, turbine housing bearings, pump and pressure system bearings, shaft end-float, flatness and clearance in pipe-flanges and cylinder heads. Wherever it is required to determine the separation between hidden surfaces. Plastigauge was introduced to US retail sales in 1948.
Plastigauge consists of a strip of soft material with precise known dimensions and deformation characteristics. This is sandwiched between a clean bearing surface on a shaft and the bearing shell itself. The plastigauge flattens after the bearing cap is tightened. The dimensional clearance is then determined by comparing the amount that the gauge material has flattened using a template. Letter designation describes the range of measurement use for each gauge.

Franz Justus Rarkowski, S.M. (June 8, 1873 – February 9, 1950Catholic-Hierarchy. "Bishop Franz Justus Rarkowski, S.M. †".) was the Catholic military bishop of Nazi Germany. The existence of such a role was provided for by the Reichskonkordat (1933), and Rarkowski had been acting head of the military chaplaincy since 1929, before he was officially consecrated on February 29, 1938 as episcopus castrensis.Barry, 1969, p. 218. Rarkowski's title was translated into English as "Field Bishop of the German Army".New York Times. October 5, 1940. "Catholic Bishop Says Nazis Wage 'Just War'." p. 4.
The first draft of the Apostolic Brief to regulate the military chaplaincy was given to the German government on June 26, 1934. The brief was issued on September 19, 1935.Lewy, 2000, p. 237.
Rarkowski was born in Allenstein, East Prussia (today Olsztyn, Poland). He was a former associate of President Paul von Hindenburg, and Ambassador Diego von Bergen was informed in July 1935 that he was the favored candidate of the Nazi Party. Rarkowski had not graduated from high school, but was admitted to study theology for the priesthood in Switzerland, where he left his religious order. According to historian Guenter Lewy, the German bishops' opposition to Rarkowski's candidacy "stemmed from the episcopate's feeling that he was their inferior and a threat to their status rather than from the unacceptability of his political ideas". Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo argued that Rarkowski, at 62, was too old for the post, but raised no other objections.Lewy, 2000, p. 238. Rarkowski was named acting army bishop in August 1936. He was consecrated by Orsenigo, assisted by Konrad von Preysing and Clemens August Graf von Galen.
The Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany had long opposed the existence of such a role, while Hitler's government demanded that the military chaplaincy be exempt from the episcopal jurisdiction of the residential bishops. Once the hierarchy consented to Rarkowski's consecration, he was excluded from the meetings of the Fulda Conference except when military matters were discussed. His office was in the defense ministry in Berlin.
Rarkowski was a public and vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, known especially for his nationalistic and militaristic speeches and writings. On the eve of the 1939 invasion of Poland, Rarkowski told soldiers: "Comrades, the issue is your homeland and your people! Be manly and strong!".Franziskus Justus Rarkowski, "HeimatgruBeta an alle katholischen Wehrmachtangehorigen," Verordnungsblatt, no. 3 (18 October 1939): 10, AKM Bonn.Doris L. Bergen. 2001. "German Military Chaplains in World War II and the Dilemmas of Legitimacy". Church History, 70(2): p. 232. In an October 4, 1940 pastoral letter, Rarkowski argued that Germany was "waging a just war" and praised German Catholic soldiers for the "Christian attitude they have maintained on the field of battle". Rarkowski continued:
There were 560 Catholic military chaplains in Nazi Germany at the outbreak of World War II.Lewy, 2000, p. 236. Hermann Göring had forbidden such chaplain in the air force, but the other branches of the military were generally supportive of the institution.
After the remilitarisation of West Germany in 1955, when the military vicarate was re-established, it was independent of the army authorities; Pius XII appointed Cardinal Josef Wendel of Munich as new military ordinariate for West Germany. In communist East Germany there was no established military chaplaincy.

Diego Masi (Cremona, 11 February 1947) is an Italian entrepreneur and politician, deputy during the XII and XIII legislatures.
Loyalist of Mariotto Segni, he overlooked the political scene during the elections of 1994 as a member of the Segni Pact. He was elected in the proportional share for the small center party. He pursued the opposition to the Berlusconi government positions from the center and subsequently, with the Pact, he was promoter of the alliance of center-left The Olive Tree. In 1995 it was candidate for President of the Lombardy Region supported by the whole center-left (excluding PRC) against the candidate of the center-right, Roberto Formigoni. He was defeated by collecting about 28% of the Lombard votes.
During the elections of 1996 he was elected by the majoritarian system in the constituency of Castiglione, under the coalition of The Olive Tree as a member of the Dini List - Italian Renewal, which was merged with The Pact. He became leader of the Italian Renewal in the Chamber of Deputies. During the term, however, he departed from the movement of Dini and approached UDR reconstituting with 2 other members (Giuseppe Bicocchi and Elisa Pozza Tasca) the subgroup of The Pact inside of the Mixed group (with the name "Pact-UDR-Liberal"). In the D'Alema government he was appointed Undersecretary of the Interior. But soon he distanced himself from the center and the Government and adhered to the Pole of Freedoms, joining the group of Forza Italia.
Member of Labor Committee, among its initiatives he included those for reform of workers relationships and placement, and those for the reform of the rules concerning the legal status of foreigners.

Before entering the inner Solar System for a 1982 perihelion passage, C/1980 E1 had a barycentric (epoch 1950-Jan-01) orbit with an apoapsis distance of 74,600 AU (1.17 light-years), and a period of approximately 7.1 million years.
As the comet was approaching perihelion on December 9, 1980, it passed within 0.228 AU of Jupiter,[ref]
</ref> which accelerated the comet briefly giving an (epoch 1981-Jan-09) eccentricity of 1.066.<ref name=barycenter/>  The comet came to perihelion on March 12, 1982.<ref name=jpldata/> Since the epoch of 1977-Mar-02, C/1980 E1 has had a barycentric eccentricity greater than 1,<ref name=barycenter/> keeping it on a hyperbolic trajectory that will eject it from the Solar System.
Since February 2008, the comet has been more than 50 AU from the Sun.[ref]

The production of OH was observed pre-perihelion while the comet was nearly 5AU from the Sun. CN was not detected until the comet was near perihelion. The comet nucleus was estimated to be have a radius of several kilometers. The surface crust was probably a few meters thick.

[[Introduction to Psychoanalysis]]
CATEGORIES: Books by Sigmund Freud, 1901 books, Books about psychoanalysis

Introduction to Psychoanalysis ([tpl]lang-de|Vorlesungen zur Einführung in die Psychoanalyse[/tpl]) is one of the most famous works of Sigmund Freud, calculated for a wide readership. In its first part (from 1st to 28th lecture) Freud enthusiastically outlines his approach to the unconscious, dreams, the theory of neuroses and some technical issues in the form in which it was formulated at the time of reading the lectures in Vienna in 1916-1917. From some positions outlined here Freud subsequently refused, many supplements and develops or revises in his later works. The second part ("new lecture series, from 29th to 35th) has never been read before to public, it features a different style of presentation, sometimes requiring the reader to training, sometimes polemical.
This work offers the reader acquainted with the concepts of Freud, to trace the logic of his arguments and to join his conclusions. The form of "Lectures" Freud allows lively polemical, is constantly engaging the reader in a discussion to justify their views, back them up with examples from life and from clinical practice, to identify not clarifying and weaknesses of the theory needs further elaboration.
According to the preface:
 These twenty-eight lectures to laymen are elementary and almost conversational. Freud sets forth with a frankness almost startling the difficulties and limitations of psychoanalysis, and also describes its main methods and results as only a master and originator of a new school of thought can do. These dis courses are at the same time simple and almost confidential, and they trace and sum up the results of thirty years of devoted and painstaking research. While they are not at all controversial, we incidentally see in a clearer light the distinctions between the master and some of his distinguished pupils.Freud.

[[Dangerous restart]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical safety

A Dangerous restart occurs when power or energy is applied to a device whose "on / off" switch was in the "on" position when power was applied.  In the United States the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) refers to this hazard as "The Uncontrolled Release of Mechanical, Electrical and Other Types of Hazardous Energy" DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 99–110 July 1999
The dangerous restart hazard is currently addressed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) with mandatory requirements for hazard reduction through the use of industrial grade safety devices.Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery 2002 Edition 7.5.3 Restarting, OSHA 29CFR#1910.213(b)(3)*
The mandatory safety devices require installation by licensed electricians. The cost for implementing this safety device including installation averages between US$300 and US$1,000 depending on electrical requirements of the machinery and local electrician rates.
Due to the cost and size restriction, there are currently no requirements for restart hazard reduction on appliances, small tools and handheld power equipment.
There are currently an average of 25 power tools and appliances in the average wood, metal and home economics shops in public middle and high schools across the U.S. that possess dangerous restart hazards.

[[Experimental College (movement)]]

The Experimental College Movement (also referred to as EXCO or EC) has taken several forms historically, but is generally a school within a school, based out of a college or university, that offers classes taught by not just traditional professors, but students and community members as well (often without grades and often free of charge or in some way associated with social or curricular change).
In the 1960s the idea took the form of a movement, with Experimental Colleges arising at San Francisco State College (later San Francisco State University) in 1964-65, at Tufts UniversityTufts University: The Experimental College and the University of California, Davis, in 1966,Experimental College [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] and the University of Washingtonexco.org :: Experimental College and Oberlin College in 1968.ExCo Has a New Home! In addition to these projects, which still exist today, some Experimental Colleges came in and out of existence, such as the Tussman Experimental College at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the University of Southern California.Experimental College // SCampus These projects reflect different approaches to the concept: some hold fast to the principle of cost-free courses, some offer courses for credit, some emphasize a community focus. More recently established Experimental Colleges exist at HaverfordExperimental College [tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] and in the Twin Cities.EXCO: Experimental Community Education of the Twin Cities | Formerly known as "Experimental College of the Twin Cities"
And while EXCOs draw upon a long history of many radical community movements including Popular Education, Free Schools[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl], Freedom Schools, Work Peoples' Colleges, etc., the original concept is often attributed to Alexander Meiklejohn, who spearheaded such a project at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and authored a book about the experience, The Experimental College, in 1932.The University: The experimental college: Contents

The Experimental College of the Twin Cities (EXCOtc) is an experimental college in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area that provides peer-based and free education to the wider community. It was started by Macalester students in the Spring of 2006 in response to a policy change that reflected the shrinking access to higher education nationally and the neo-liberal model in the US and around the world.[tpl]cite web|title=The METRO 100: 2008|url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090202135715/http://www.metromag.com/pages/index.cfm?PAGE_ID=174&ARTICLE_ID=2402&currentPage=1|work=Twin Cities Metro|publisher=Tiger Oak Publications|accessdate=16 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Baran|first=Madeleine|title=Experimental college marks fourth year of free classes|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/09/16/exco-experimental-college/|work=MPR News|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=16 April 2011[/tpl] EXCOtc is currently expanding to other college campuses and community groups, both of which can create their own EXCO chapters.  A second chapter was created at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities Campus) in the winter of 2007,[tpl]cite web|last=Collins|first=Jon|title=Experimental college comes to the University|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2008/01/29/experimental-college-comes-university|work=The Minnesota Daily|publisher=The Minnesota Daily|accessdate=16 April 2011[/tpl] as a continuation of protests in support of a strike by the workers of the campus's AFSCME union who demanded a living wage.  Protesting students believed that their school's administration had abandoned the principles of the public land-grant institution: equal access, social justice, democratic education.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] So, they decided to devote their energies to form a new chapter of EXCOtc, as a university that would enact those ideals.
EXCOtc exemplifies a community-based emphasis, with organizing groups at Macalester College, the University of Minnesota, and Minneapolis Community and Technical College, including students, staff and community members, and with an expansive commitment to movement building, community, and education for social change. Class titles range from Latino Labor Organizing for Alternatives to Globalization, to Jazz and Competition Dance, to Anarchist Anthropology, to the Social Responsibility of African American Music, to Bike Feminism (Theory and Mechanics), to Shape Note Singing, to Exploratory Movement, to Universal Verbal Language: Tracks of the Infinite on the Human Race.

[[Northwood R-76]]
CATEGORIES: Infantry weapons of the Cold War, Military equipment 1970–1979, Machine pistols, Telescoping bolt submachine guns, Weapons of Rhodesia

The Northwood R-76 was a submachine gun of Rhodesian origin. It was intended as a 'Land Defence Pistol' during the Rhodesian Bush War era. Its layout is somewhat much like a Vz.61 Skorpion and the TEC-9. It was available with a spike bayonet, retractable wire stock and removable bipod which predates this use on submachine guns like the CBJ-MS. Another variant, the R-77 came with a longer barrel and stock enabling the weapon to be used as a carbine.
The R-76 submachine gun was manufactured by Northwood Development Pvt-Ltd out of Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe). The weapon was designed by Roger Mansfield, a former Royal Air Force engineer who emigrated from the UK to Rhodesia, and developed keeping mind to the needs of Rhodesian farmers, ranchers and citizens living in outlying areas where Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army & Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army forces were especially active. "Home grown" in Rhodesia with the majority of parts produced from local materials, ease of manufacture and minimal machining requirements were key factors; as such, the R-76 was largely manufactured out of metal sheet stampings, with grip cheeks made either in wood, stamped aluminium or plastic (generally mid-quality or low-end molds).
The R-76 submachine gun was a selective-fire (semi-automatic/full-automatic) weapon with an average rate of fire ranging about 500 rounds per minute. It was chambered for the 9mm "Parabellum" (9x19mm) caliber, and fed by 13-round Browning Hi-Power pistol magazines, or by locally-produced 20 or 30 round magazines. It was operated by simple blowback, with a bolt running on two recoil springs like in the US made M3 "Grease Gun", and was provided with either a 6 or 8 inch, 24-groove "Microgroove"-rifled barrel. Early versions could be found with a rear aperture sight as opposed to latter simple V-notch rear sights. The collapsing wire-stock could be removed and re-installed in a reverse position so that the metal stock butt could serve as a front pistol grip to fire the weapon from the hip. The bolt retraction handle was located on the left side of the receiver, was spring-loaded and remained forward after the first round was fired
A machine-carbine version, called the R-77, was also available; the R-77 was available with a fixed wooden stock, and with a 9 or 10-inch barrel with bipod, flash hider and bayonet lug options available.
The R-76 submachine gun was deployed with some Rhodesian Army units like the "Selous Scouts", and sold to civilians. After the change of political regime in Rhodesia, the production of the R-76 submachine gun and the R-77 machine-carbine did not reprise in the Republic of South Africa, unlike other Rhodesian-grown gun projects like the "Rhuzi" (produced in South Africa as the "Kommando LDP"), the Rhogun http://www.terryaspinall.com/03merc/weapons/rhogun.html the Mamba (engineered in Rhodesia but never manufactured there, produced for a short time in South Africa and then by Navy Arms Inc. of Ridgefield, NJ, USA, before going out of production) or the ADP pistol (engineered by a Rhodesian police officer, Alex DuPlessis, produced in South Africa, in Italy, then currently in the United States, where DuPlessis currently resides and works as an engineer for Wilson Combat, LLC.). The R-76 submachine guns manufactured during the short production run in the 1970s remained around in Zimbabwe and South Africa for a while, exported by expats, and were mostly destroyed during the years. However some can be found in good conditions, although non-firing, on the deactivated guns market in the United Kingdom. Several R-76 submachine guns are also known to have made their way in Australia.

[[List of batsmen who have scored 100 centuries in first-class cricket]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of cricketers, Cricket records and statistics

In the sport of cricket, a batsman is said to have scored a century when they score 100 or more runs without being dismissed. In first-class cricket, the highest form of the game below international level, a total of 25 players have achieved the feat on a hundred or more occasions.[tpl]cite book|last=Hussain|first=Nasser|authorlink=Nasser Hussain|title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|editor=Scyld Berry (ed)|publisher=John Wisden & Co|year=2009|edition=146th|pages=54|chapter=The Masters of Modern County Cricket[/tpl]
The first cricketer to achieve the feat was W. G. Grace, who completed his hundredth century in 1895. Grace remains the only batsman to have achieved the feat and finish with a batting average below 40.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/251072.html|title=Most hundreds in a career|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl]
The English County Championship has historically always been the first-class competition in which the most matches are played per season, hence the most conducive competition to prolific runscoring. Of the 25 men to have scored 100 first-class centuries, all have been either natively English or English-qualified except Donald Bradman of Australia, Zaheer Abbas of Pakistan, Glenn Turner of New Zealand and West Indian Viv Richards. Zaheer Abbas (Gloucestershire), Turner (Worcestershire) and Richards (Somerset) all had substantial county careers as overseas players; Bradman, the first non-English batsman to achieve the feat, therefore remains the only batsman to have done so despite never having played for an English county side.

The fern genus Mohria is a small one of eight species, restricted to southern Africa and Madagascar.  Plants in this genus superficially resemble Cheilanthes, but the sporangial structure indicates their close affinity to Anemia.  Unlike all other genera in the Schizaeales, plants of Mohria do not have dimorphic fronds.
The basal chromosome count of this genus is consistently n=76, based on the number n=38, which is consistent with Anemia.

In order to overcome the typical loss of strength bamboo incurs when bending takes place post-harvest, an alternative method to overcome this has been developed.
Pre-harvest bending of the bamboo stems in zig-zags, allows the bamboo to later form a Warren truss.[ref]

Alexander Vittouris has proposed a much simpler 2D S-bend shape, which — after harvesting, and in sufficient quantities — could be assembled into a variety of 3D shapes. The arboriculture technique used to make both shapes is similar to tree shaping, and result in parts similar to knee (construction).[ref]

[[Lyman-break galaxy]]
CATEGORIES: Physical cosmology, Galaxies

Lyman-break galaxies are star-forming galaxies at high redshift that are selected using the differing appearance of the galaxy in several imaging filters due to the position of the Lyman limit.  The technique has primarily been used to select galaxies at redshifts of z = 3–4 using ultraviolet and optical filters, but progress in ultraviolet astronomy and in infrared astronomy has allowed the use of this technique at lower and higher redshifts using ultraviolet and near-infrared filters.
The Lyman-break galaxy selection technique relies on the fact that radiation at higher energies than the Lyman limit at 912 Å is almost completely absorbed by neutral gas around star-forming regions of galaxies.  In the rest frame of the emitting galaxy, the emitted spectrum is bright at wavelengths longer than 912 Å, but very dim or imperceptible at shorter wavelengths—this is known as a "dropout", or "break", and can be used to find the position of the Lyman limit.  Light with a wavelength shorter than 912 Å is in the far-ultraviolet range and is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere, but for very distant galaxies the wavelengths of light are stretched considerably because of the expansion of the Universe.  For a galaxy at redshift z = 3, the Lyman break will appear to be at wavelengths of about 3600 Å, which is long enough to be detected by ground- or space-based telescopes.
Candidate galaxies around redshift z = 3 can then be selected by looking for galaxies which appear in optical images (which are sensitive to wavelengths greater than 3600 Å), but do not appear in ultraviolet images (which are sensitive to light at wavelengths shorter than 3600 Å).  The technique may be adapted to look for galaxies at other redshifts by choosing different sets of filters—the method works as long as images may be taken through at least one filter above and below the wavelength of the redshifted Lyman limit. In order to confirm the redshift estimated by the color selection, follow-up spectroscopy is performed.  Although spectroscopic measurements are necessary to obtain a high-precision redshift, spectroscopy is typically much more time-consuming than imaging, so the selection of candidate galaxies via the Lyman-break technique greatly improves the efficiency of high-redshift galaxy surveys.
The issue of their far-infrared emission is still central to the study of Lyman-break galaxies to better understand their evolution and estimate their total star formation rate. So far, only a small sample has been detected in far-infrared. Most of the results rely on an information gathered from lensed Lyman-break galaxies or from the rest-frame ultraviolet, or from a few objects detected by the Herschel satellite  or using the stacking technique  that allows to obtain averaged values for individually undetected Lyman-break galaxies.

In January 2010, a BBC Northern Ireland documentary revealed that Iris Robinson had an affair in 2008 and had procured £50,000 in loans for her lover to finance a start-up restaurant. She had failed to declare her monetary interest in the restaurant, despite serving on the council which gave it permission to open.[tpl]cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Alastair |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6956531/Iris-Robinson-expelled-from-DUP-after-financial-row-over-affair-with-toyboy-lover.html |title=Iris Robinson expelled from DUP after financial row over affair with toyboy lover |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/robinson-fights-for-political-life-amidst-irisgate-scandal-1.997215|title=Robinson fights for political life amidst Irisgate scandal|last=Crichton|first=Torcuil|date=8 January 2010|work=The Herald|accessdate=9 January 2010|location=Scotland[/tpl] Before the airing of the documentary, it was also revealed that she had attempted suicide on 1 March 2009.[tpl]cite news|author=Henry McDonald |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/peter-iris-robinson-bbc-investigation |title=Peter and Iris Robinson face questions after BBC documentary |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 January 2010|accessdate=2011-03-09 |location=London[/tpl]
As a result, Iris Robinson was expelled from the DUP and she resigned her seats in both Westminster and the Northern Ireland Assembly, retiring from politics. Peter Robinson also unexpectedly lost his own Westminster seat (Belfast East) in the 2010 general election, a result which was attributed in part to the scandal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/stormonts-first-minister-peter-robinson-unseated-after-year-of-scandal-1965819.html|title=Stormont's First Minister unseated after year of scandal|accessdate=24 September 2013|location=England|work=The Independent|first=David|last=McKittrick|date=7 May 2010[/tpl]

[[Thermofoil]]
CATEGORIES: Surface decorative techniques in woodworking

Thermofoil is a surface finish applied to cabinets by multiple manufacturers. It is a plastic material which is thermoformed to the profile of an underlying engineered wood core such as medium-density fiberboard.  Thermofoil typically has a high-quality sheen and may incorporate metallic elements in its finish (analogous to the metallic paint on an automobile).
Often used for making kitchen cabinet doors, this reasonably priced and commonly available synthetic material is a thin, tight, heat-sealed plastic wrap used to mold over an MDF substrate. Thermofoil cabinet doors can be a solid color or imitation wood grain. The cabinet boxes that accompany these doors can be finished in various materials such matching thermofoil, coordinating paint, and laminates. Thermofoil is available in a range of textures and sheen levels, the most popular choice being solid white with a matte sheen. For a budget kitchen remodel, a thermofoil cabinet door is an easy and economical alternative to white paint. 
The downside of thermofoil is its greater susceptibility to heat and moisture compared to other materials. Heat-generating appliances such as coffeemakers and toasters should not be placed too close to the cabinets. Heat shields can be placed between cabinets and major appliances such as dishwashers and ranges. Many appliances come with built-in shields.http://cabinets-q-and-a.com/exterior-kitchen-cabinet-materials.html

Karmic Astrology is practiced by some astrologers who believe in reincarnation though the concept of Karma is not always associated to Indian religions. Indeed, Edgar Cayce, a devout Christian, professed that the position of the planets at birth records the time spent by the souls on other planets (or perhaps their spiritual counterparts) in between incarnations.Margaret Gammon, Astrology and the Edgar Cayce Readings, A.R.E. Press, Virginia Beach, 1967. Some karmic astrologers have professed they can read the person's karma in a Natal chart by studying in particular Lunar nodes and retrograde planets.Martin Schulman, Karmic Astrology, Volume 1: The Moon's Nodes and Reincarnation, Weiser Books, 1975, ISBN 0-87728-288-9 and Martin Schulman, Karmic Astrology, Volume 2: Retrogrades and Reincarnation, Samuel Weiser Inc., 1977, ISBN 0-87728-345-1.

[[Servilia (gens)]]
CATEGORIES: Servilii, Roman gentes

The gens Servilia was a patrician family at Rome.  The gens was celebrated during the early ages of the Republic, and the names of few gentes appear more frequently at this period in the consular Fasti.  It continued to produce men of influence in the state down to the latest times of the Republic, and even in the imperial period.  The first member of the gens who obtained the consulship was Publius Servilius Priscus Structus in 495 BC, and the last of the name who appears in the consular Fasti is Quintus Servilius Silanus, in AD 189, thus occupying a prominent position in the Roman state for nearly seven hundred years.
Like other Roman gentes, the Servilii of course had their own sacra; and they are said to have worshipped a triens, or copper coin, which is reported to have increased or diminished in size at various times, thus indicating the increase or diminution of the honors of the gens.  Although the Servilii were originally patricians, in the later Republic there were also plebeian Servilii.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.Fasti Capitolini.Gaius Plinius Secundus, Historia Naturalis, xxxiv. 13. s. 38.

Thomas (Tom) Dissevelt (4 March 1921, Leiden - 1989) was a Dutch composer and musician.  He is known as a pioneer in the merging of electronic music and jazz.  He married Rina Reys, sister of Rita Reys in 1946.  
Tom Dissevelt was also known as bassist / arranger in the Skymasters and helped on the records of Rita Reijs. 
Between 1939 and 1944 Dissevelt studied at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.  He took over three years in trombone lessons and then went onto study clarinet, music theory and piano.  He stopped studying the clarinet because he was too busy and took bass lessons from Herman Stotijn of the Residence Orchestra. 
After the war Dissevelt moved to Indonesia with the Jos Cleber Orchestra to work.  He was in love with Rina Reys, and married her in 1946.  In 1947 he did an international tour with Ilcken Wessel, the husband of Rita Reys, and the orchestra of Piet van Dijk.  This tour lasted three years, where she acted in Spain and North Africa. 
In 1955 Bep Rowold, leader of the Skymasters, hired Dissevelt as a bassist and arranger.  He became interested in 12-tone music, listened to the many German radio stations, and heard works by Karlheinz Stockhausen and Anton Webern.  Recommended by Philips, he was invited to the Natlab studios electronic music.  Together with Dick Raaijmakers (alias "Kid Baltan") he composed electronic music.  Many of his compositions are now heard on the record "Popular Electronics - Early Dutch electronic music from Philips Research Laboratories, 1956-1963". 
The way pop music was emerging and the changing of the way radio stations operated (with the disbandment of radio orchestras) made Dissevelt decide to give up working with orchestras. He became assistant to renowned Dutch entertainers such as Wim Sonneveld and Toon Hermans.

CATEGORIES: War of 1812 ships of Canada, Maritime history of Canada, Military history of Nova Scotia, Tall ships of Canada, Individual sailing vessels, Privateer ships, Brigs, Captured ships

The Sir John Sherbooke of Saint John, New Brunswick was a letter of marque brig named after Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, Governor of Nova Scotia. Though technically a privateer, she was actually an armed merchantman. She was commissioned on 27 November 1812 and carried ten guns and a crew of 30 men. The smallness of her crew relative to the number of her guns, as well as the small amount of the amount of ammunition that she carried are consistent with her being an armed trader rather than a prize-taker.
Sir John Sherbrooke made several voyages to the West Indies. On 11 January 1813 The American privateer Defiance, of Charleston, armed with four guns and carrying a crew of 98 men, captured Sir John Sherbrook, Robson, master, from New Brunswick, at Cow Bay, Jamaica. The Americans abandoned her though and in February she reached Bermuda from Jamaica.Lloyd's List,http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/03-26-1813.jpg - accessed 25 November 2013.
She made several more successful trading voyages. Then she left Richibucto, New Brunswick on 11 October under Captain Thomas Robson with a reduced crew of 20. On 30 October she encountered an American privateer off Cape Maize while sailing the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti. The Sir John Sherbrooke was able to hold her off for some five hours until Robson suffered a severe wound that almost killed him. The two vessels then accidentally ran into each other, and the Americans boarded the Canadian ship, capturing her.
Sir John Sherbrooke had lost one man killed and seven wounded, including Robson. Two died later. The American privateer schooner Saucy Jack, under Capt. John P. Chazal, out of Charleston, South Carolina, had suffered 15 men wounded. The Americans took Sir John Sherbrooke into Cuba as a prize. Lloyd's List reported that the Saucy Jack was armed with 11 guns and had a crew of 110 men.Lloyd's List, 4 February 1814.

Scilly naval disaster of 1707 is an umbrella term for the events of 22 October 1707 that led to the sinking of a British naval fleet off the Isles of Scilly. With four large ships and more than 1,400 sailors lost in stormy weather, it was one of the worst maritime disasters in the history of the British Isles. It was later determined that the main cause of the disaster was the navigators' inability to accurately calculate their positions.Nicholls, Mark, Norfolk Maritime Heroes and Legends, Poppyland Publishing, Cromer 2008, pp. 25–30, ISBN 978-0-946148-85-1.

CATEGORIES: Digital rights management

A Seed is a sculpture or object that contains digital data that is sold for the purpose of keeping the information out of the hands of pirates for as long as possible, in addition to associating the transitory digital information (music, literature, movies, software) with the perceived permanence of the medium of sculpture. Additionally, the data sold in sculpture form is kept free from amendment, deletion, or corruption.  This allows for the curation of virtual data in the same way that books, albums, or DVDs are collected.  Additionally, a seed is one solution to the problem of how you "gift" a virtual product.
The name is derived from the BitTorrent term for a peer who has a complete copy of a torrent and still offers it for upload.  The name and philosophy behind the concept comes from an article by Miracle Jones called "Wunderkammer Seeds: A Fantasia"http://www.fictioncircus.com/news.php?id=407&mode=one published in The Fiction Circus.

Floridiana is a term referring to artifacts and collections of artifacts relating to the state of Florida in the United States of America, especially those artifacts pertaining to Floridian history, geography, folklore, and cultural heritage.Reference page from the Florida State University System 
Mediums, objects, and themes falling into the category of Floridiana could include paintings, prints, drawings, and postcards representing Florida's history or culture; fiction, non-fiction, music, and poetry describing or alluding to the state; tools and equipment commonly used in the state, for example fishing and hunting equipment; and industries prevalent in the state, for example tourism, citrus growing, and sugar production. 
Nostalgia is often an element in the appreciation of Floridiana - the nostalgia that evokes yearning for an unattainable or irrecoverable state, where the Floridian wilderness as well as its pioneering spirit have been decimated by urban and industrial growth, as in the fiction of Carl Hiaasen,New York Times review citing Hiaasen's ecological themes and the lyrics of early Jimmy Buffett.Tourism Bureau of Key West article referencing Jimmy Buffett's musical themes

The Panama held a  parliamentary election on 5 May 1945, electing both a Constitutional Assembly.
On 28 December 1944, a severe political crisis took place just prior to the opening of the National Assembly which was to convene on 2 January 1945. The next day President Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia Arango suspended the Constitution of 1941, consequently cancelled the next prescribed session of the National Assembly, and called for a general election on 5 May 1945, to elect delegates to a Constitutional Assembly which would frame a new Constitution. Political tension continued during the spring of 1945 but the elections held on 5 May 1945, were peaceful and orderly, with approximately 110000 voters participating (women voted in the national election for the first time). These elections showed a heavy vote for liberal elements and a coalition of the Liberal Renewal Party of Francisco Arias Paredes, the Liberal Democratic Party of Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, elements of the Liberal Doctrinaire Party of Domingo Díaz Arosemena, and elements of the National Revolutionary Party (the "official" party of the de la Guardia administration) united and, controlling 30 of the 46 delegates to the Constitutional Assembly, elected Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, former Panamanian Ambassador to Washington, Provisional President of the Republic to hold office during the life of the Constitutional Assembly and until a new President, elected in accordance with the provisions of the new Constitution, would assume office. This election took place on 15 June 1945. Former President de la Guardia retired from public office to become Director and General Manager of the newspaper La Nacion.

The Getty Union Artist Names List has him active until 1144 http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Rainer+of+Huy&role=&nation=&prev_page=1&subjectid=500081355  Another equally shadowy figure in Mosan metalwork from the next generation, Godefroid de Huy/de Claire, also came from the small but prosperous city of Huy on the Meuse.
The only other work generally agreed to be by the same master as the font is a small bronze crucifix figure (Schnütgen Museum, Cologne); another in Brussels is probably from the same mould, with extra chasing.  Others in Brussels and Dublin are probably from the workshop as they have many similarities.Lasko, 181, and plate 182 for the Cologne figure. one of the Brussels figures is illustrated in Xhayet and Halleux, before p. 129

CATEGORIES: Steam engines, Engine technology

The Westinghouse Farm Engine was a small, vertical-boilered farm engine that emerged in the late nineteenth century.  In the transition from horses to machinery, small portable steam engines were hauled by horses from farm to farm. Many small workshops produced them. As a side line to the airbrake products, George Westinghouse made this horse-drawn, vertical-boilered and horizontal-cylinder engine. It looked like a coffee pot on wheels. It came in 6, 10 and 15 HP sizes. The engines were produced from 1886 to 1917 when they were superseded by larger standard farm engines. Many engines of this make were sent to South America where they were popular.
Henry Ford even worked with one on a farm and it became a favourite of his. For a time Ford worked for the Westinghouse Company as a mechanic for their farm engines, and now one features in his museum at Dearborn, Michigan.

CATEGORIES: New Zealand journalists, People from Christchurch, BBC newsreaders and journalists, 1952 births, Living people

Diana Goodman (born 1952 in Christchurch, New Zealand) is a New Zealand-born journalist who became the BBC's first female foreign correspondent.
Goodman was educated at Lytton High School, Gisborne, and Samuel Marsden Collegiate School for Girls, Wellington, before studying journalism at the Wellington Polytechnic School of Journalism.
After graduating, she worked for the Cook Islands Broadcasting and Newspaper Corporation, The Dominion, and the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. She moved to Britain in 1975 and started out in commercial radio before joining BBC Radio Manchester as a news producer in 1978.
Goodman became a network radio reporter in 1982. The following year she was sent to Australia and New Zealand to cover the Prince and Princess of Wales' first tour abroad. In 1984, she reported from Beirut on the Lebanese Civil War. The BBC attracted some criticism from listeners who objected to a woman being sent to cover a conflict.
In 1986, Goodman was posted to Bonn as the BBC's first-ever female foreign correspondent.[tpl]cite book|isbn=0-340-55599-8|author=Anne Sebba.|year=1994|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=London|title=Battling for news : the rise of woman reporter[/tpl] As well as reporting on West Germany, she covered Kurt Waldheim's election as president of Austria. During the political upheavals in Eastern Europe in 1989, she came under fire while reporting on the overthrow of President Nicolae Ceauşescu.
In January 1990, the BBC was able to open its first bureau in East Berlin and Goodman was based there as Eastern Europe correspondent from 1990 to 1993. She reported on the first democratic elections in Eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and, from Moscow, the resignation of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and the end of the Soviet Union.
In 1994 Goodman was posted to Russia, serving as Moscow correspondent until 1998. She covered the political ramifications of the war in Chechnya, Boris Yeltsin's presidency and the effects of economic change. A dispatch for From Our Own Correspondent on the plight of handicapped children in Russia's orphanages produced a strong response from listeners.[tpl]cite web|last=Keane |first=Fergal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/fooc50/4181812.stm |title=Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | FOOC50 | The power of storytelling |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Goodman |first=Diana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/fooc50/4163954.stm |title=Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | FOOC50 | Few comforts for Russia's abandoned children |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Carey |first=John |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article1080936 |title=Reportage: From Our Own Correspondent |publisher=The Times |date=2005-08-21 |accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2010[/tpl]

The Crewe and Shrewsbury Railway was a railway owned by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) company, built to connect Crewe with the jointly owned with the GWR Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway.
Authorised in 1853, planning difficulties accessing the GWR station at Shrewsbury delayed opening until 1858. Proving so successful for both companies to transport coal from the South Wales Valleys to industrial Northwest England, and finished goods in the opposite direction, it was doubled tracked by 1862.
Amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway in the 1920s, post nationalisation into British Railways, its services reduced as motor transport proved quicker more cost effective than its various branch lines. It now forms the northern section of Network Rail's Welsh Marches Line.

Academic and vocational classes were offered. The "Girls' Division," formally known as "Girls' Edison High School," was split in September 1936, and moved to the vacated Brooklyn School building. In September 1938, the program moved again to the Holliday School building, where its name was changed to "Jane Addams High School for Girls." The Boys' Edison High School moved to Sabin School in 1939 because of low attendance at the Sabin School, and the Edison program was renamed Sabin High School.
The schools were closed by June 13, 1947, partly because the space was needed for increased elementary school enrollment due to the baby boom.

Kinkonychelys ("Lac Kinkony Study Area turtle") is an extinct genus of side-necked turtle which existed in Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous period.[tpl]cite journal | last = Gaffney | first = Eugene S. | authorlink = Eugene S. Gaffney | coauthors = Krause, D.W. and Zalmout, I.S. |year= 2009 |title= Kinkonychelys, a new side-necked turtle (Pelomedusoides: Bothremydidae) from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar |journal= American Museum Novitates |volume= 3662 |pages= 1–25 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5985/1/N3662.pdf |format=pdf | doi=10.1206/672.1[/tpl] It contains the single species Kinkonychelys rogersi, named in honor of its discoverer, Raymond R. Rogers. The genus and species are based on UA 9748, a nearly complete skull, which represents the first turtle skull described from the pre-Holocene era in Madagascar. A number of isolated skull and jaw bones have also been assigned to K. rogersi. These specimens were found in rocks of the Maastrichtian-age Maevarano Formation in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Another specimen, FMNH PR 2446, is speculated to represent another species, currently known as Kinkonychelys sp., but consensus on its distinction from K. rogersi remains unclear.
The Maevarano Formation is a nonmarine rock formation that was deposited under a seasonal, semi-arid climate.  A diverse vertebrate assemblage is known from the formation, including fishes, frogs, other turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodyliforms, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals.  The rocks of the formation can be subdivided into several members.  UA 9748 was found in a claystone bed from an unnamed upper member; this member has also produced abundant and well-preserved fossils of ray-finned fish, crocodyliforms, and dinosaurs.  The other specimens assigned to Kinkonocheyls were found in the older Anembalemba Formation.
Kinkonychelys is classified as a member of the Kurmademydini group in the family Bothremydidae, together with the late Cretaceous turtles Sankuchemys and Kurmademys, from India. The classification of Kinkonychelys into this group has helped to support the theory that the island of Madagascar and the subcontinent India were connected to each other prior to the end of the late Cretaceous period.

Una Lucy Silberrad ([tpl]Birth date|1872|5|8|df=yes[/tpl] – [tpl]Death date|1955|9|1|df=yes[/tpl]), to use her own term, was a British authoress.  Both her grave slab and her memorial brass in St.Mary's Burnham-on-Crouch, specifically use that term, thus avoiding both the gender-neutral term "writer", as well as the later 20th century tendency towards female 'authors';  all highly consistent with Una Silberrad's feminist views. She first lived at Buckhurst Hill, and then moved to Burnham on Crouch later in life.  She was an elder sister of the chemist Oswald Silberrad, and some fragments of his scientific work appear in her fiction.  She never married.

The programme's original cast included Lenora Crichlow as Annie the ghost, Russell Tovey as George the werewolf, and Aidan Turner as Mitchell the vampire.
For series 3, Sinead Keenan was promoted from a supporting to a main character as George's werewolf girlfriend, Nina, and the characters and the show's location moved to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. Turner left the show at the end of series 3, and his character was killed off. On 11 November 2011, Russell Tovey announced that he was leaving Being Human during series 4 to work full-time on his other show, Him & Her,Iqbal, Nosheen.

[[Siege of Bayonne]]
CATEGORIES: Sieges, 1130 in Europe, 1131 in Europe, Conflicts in 1130, Conflicts in 1131, Bayonne

The Siege of Bayonne was launched by Alfonso the Battler, King of Aragon and Navarre, apparently against the Duke of Aquitaine, William X, and lasted from October 1130 to October 1131.Lynn H. Nelson, "Alfonso I, King of Aragón", Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia, edited by Michael Gerli and Samuel G. Armistead (Taylor & Francis, 2003), 51. The city of Bayonne was then a part of Aquitaine, nominally a part of France. The chief narrative source for the siege of Bayonne is the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, a contemporary account of events in Spain compiled to celebrate the feats of Alfonso VII of León and Castile. The siege began with knights, infantry, and siege engines and included the plundering of the environs of the city and assaults on its walls. The arrival of a relief army led to a famous joust and the prolongation of the siege. The siege was a failure, and was lifted after Alfonso had made his famous last will and testament.
The primary sources are insufficient to fully explain the purposes behind Alfonso's siege, but historians are unanimous in attributing his actions to his ongoing conflict with his western neighbour, Alfonso VII, hero of the aforementioned Chronica. The latter had concluded an alliance with Alfonso's eastern neighbour, Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona, by marrying his daughter, Berengaria, in 1127. This may have prompted Alfonso to make an attack on Raymond's allies north of the Pyrenees in an effort to scuttle Raymond's political aspirations there, for Raymond was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine.Bernard F. Reilly, The Medieval Spains (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 110–11. At the same time the Count of Toulouse, Alfonso Jordan, had done homage to Alfonso VII upon his succession in 1126. In March that year, with Suero Vermúdez, he had even taken the capital city of León from some rebels holding out in favour of an illegitimate half-brother of Alfonso VII, one of the sons of his mother, Queen Urraca, and her lover, Pedro González de Lara.Antonio Sánchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana en la plena Edad Media: el linaje de Lara (SS. XI–XIII), Doctoral Thesis (University of Seville, 2003), 93–94. Urraca's second, childless marriage was to Alfonso the Battler. For a period of over a decade the two had been engaged in a civil war for power in Castile and León. With the death of Urraca, Alfonso VII, her son by an earlier marriage, succeeded to her position as primary rival of Alfonso the Battler for the rule of these two kingdoms. In besieging Bayonne, Alfonso the Battler was perhaps hoping to persuade the Count of Toulouse to switch allegiance to him and aid him in his war in Castile.
The attacking army was probably already passing through the Pyrenees when, on 4 September 1130, Alfonso visited a chapel in Ardanés, a now depopulated village in the Valle de Hecho. The army probably crossed via the pass at Somport in order to enter Gascony through the allied territory of Béarn.José Ángel Lema Pueyo, "El itinerario de Alfonso I ‘El batallador’ (1104–1134)," Historia, instituciones, documentos, 24 (1997), 351. The first direct reference to the siege dates from 26 October 1130, when Alfonso issued a fuero to the town of Corella from Bayonne, called "the fortress of Bayonne" (illo castello de Baiona).Simon F. Barton and Richard A. Fletcher, The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000), 185. It had begun shortly before 16 October, if both the Chronica and the obituary of Burgos Cathedral are accurate. The former records how Pedro González de Lara, after he was captured by Alfonso VII for his part in the rebellion, joined the siege of Bayonne "in order to bring him the Battler back to Castile" (ut reducere eum in Castellam) because he wanted  "to wage war in Castile" (facere bellum in Castella), that is, continue the revolt. While Pedro's capture occurred in June, his death at the siege did not occur until 16 October, according to the obituary of Burgos, where he is buried.Barton and Fletcher, 172.Simon F. Barton, The Aristocracy in Twelfth-Century León and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 280.
According to the Chronica, "during the time when Alfonso was at war with the rebel nobles ... the King of Aragon had mobilised sizeable armies of knights and infantrymen ... had traveled then beyond his own borders to Gascony where he surrounded the city of Bayonne which is located near the Garonne River."CAI, I, §50. The English translation used here is G. E. Lipskey, The Chronicle of Alfonso the Emperor: A Translation of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris (PhD dissertation, Northwestern University, 1972). It subsequently relates how for several days he plundered the countryside around Bayonne before assaulting the city's walls with siege engines brought from Aragon. At some point a relief army led by Alfonso Jordan, count of Toulouse, arrived. Pedro, for reasons unknown, challenged him to a joust. In the words of the Chronica: "Count Pedro asked the Count of Toulouse for single combat" (comes Petrus petiit comiti Tolosano singulare certamen), "both went out to fight much like two strong lions" (sicut duo leones fortes), and "Count Pedro was wounded by Alfonso's lance and, falling from his horse, broke his arm and died a few days later" (et vulneratus est comes Petrus ab hasta comitis Adefonsi et, cadens de equo, fractum est brachium eius et post paucos dies mortuus est).CAI, I, §18. The Chronica records Pedro's challenge to Alfonso that they "fight together" in words probably adapted from 1 Samuel, 17:10, which records Goliath's challenge: "I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together." (New American Standard Bible) Alfonso was apparently unharmed. It is possible that Pedro González was in the company of Alfonso's mother, Elvira of Castile, Countess of Toulouse, when the young future count of Toulouse was brought back to Europe from Outremer.Margarita C. Torres Sevilla-Quiñones de León, "Cruzados y peregrinos leoneses y castellanos en Tierra Santa (ss. XI–XII)", Medievalismo, 9 (1999), 63–82. In any case they shared a history going back at least to the disputed succession of Alfonso VII.
In his trans-Pyrenean expedition, the Aragonese king's allies were Gaston IV of Béarn and Centule II of Bigorre. Besides the aforementioned knights, infantry, and siege engines, Alfonso also blockaded the city with ships on the river Adour. The siege dragged on, however, and during his year-long absence from Spain, Alfonso the Battler lost Castrojeriz and the other places he held in Castile west of the Sierra de la Demanda to Alfonso VII. The Aragonese king himself remained at the siege throughout the end of 1130, as charters he issued on 19 November and in December indicate. He continued to be "about Bayonne" (super Baiona) from January to May 1131, as both royal and private documents say. The siege continued through the summer, but in July and August Alfonso was leading forces in a place called Rocha Tallata or Rocathalada, possibly modern Peyrehorade. While still besieging Bayonne (in obsessione Baione), Alfonso drafted his will in October 1131: it contains the last datable reference to the siege. This will was later confirmed at Sariñena on 4 September 1134.Barton and Fletcher, 188.For an extended discussion of this will, cf. Elena Lourie, "The Will of Alfonso I, ‘El Batallador,’ King of Aragon and Navarre: A Reassessment", Speculum, 50:4 (1975), 635. When the siege was lifted is not known, but most of November 1131 must have been spent returning, by way of the Camino de Santiago, to Aragon. In December the royal court was at Tiermas.

Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology (FMIE)[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 19999375 | volume=122 | issue=11-12 | title=on zoonoses: central element of the "One Health" initiative | year=2009 | author=Wieler LH, Antão EM, Semmler T | journal=Berl. Munch. Tierarztl. Wochenschr. | pages=412–6[/tpl] is an emerging area of medicine that entails the study of pathogen genes and genomes in the context of their functional association with the host niches (adhesion, invasion, adaptation) and the complex interactions they trigger within the host immune system (cell signaling, apoptosis) to culminate in varied outcomes of the infection. This can also be defined as the correlation of genetic variations in a pathogen or its respective host with a unique function that is important for disease severity, disease progression, or host susceptibility to a particular pathogen. Functional epidemiology implies not only  descriptive host-pathogen genomic associations, but rather the interplay between pathogen and host genomic variations to functionally demonstrate the role of the genetic variations during infection. 
Functional Molecular Infection Epidemiology differs from classical Molecular Infection Epidemiology mainly in that the latter deals with the tagging and tracking of the infectious agent without much concern for the functional/phenotypic characteristics of the agent being tracked. Functional molecular epidemiology, on the other hand, lays more emphasis on genotypic and phenotypic correlates of host-pathogen interaction, adaptation or homeostasis. Furthermore, classical molecular epidemiology largely uses “neutral” markers, such as insertion sequences and intergenic elements, while functional molecular epidemiology harnesses functionally relevant markers such as SNPs and genome co-ordinates with putative roles in infection biology – both on the pathogen and the host side. Many studies have been conducted which fit the theme of FMIE - for example, acquisition and transmission of the Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and its role in the development of Type-1 diabetes mellitus when human gene SLC11A1 undergoes particular mutations in a susceptible host.[tpl]cite journal |author=Paccagnini D, Sieswerda L, Rosu V, et al. |title=Linking chronic infection and autoimmune diseases: Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, SLC11A1 polymorphisms and type-1 diabetes mellitus |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=e7109 |year=2009 |pmid=19768110 |pmc=2740822 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007109 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007109[/tpl]
The concept of FMIE has become potentially relevant in the aftermath of multiple genome sequencing and resequencing of important bacterial pathogens from many different host/patient populations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ahmed N |title=A flood of microbial genomes-do we need more? |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=e5831 |year=2009 |pmid=19513110 |pmc=2688083 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005831 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005831[/tpl]
A consortium of scientists in India and Germany is (Project BRIDGE) already formed under the aegis of the Freie University in Berlin and the University of Hyderabad to explore and investigate the application of FMIE in public health and Veterinary arena.

[[New legal realism]]

CATEGORIES: Theories of law, Political realism

New Legal Realism NLR is an emerging school of thought in U.S. legal philosophy.
Although it draws on the older Legal Realism from the first half of the twentieth century, New Legal Realism differs in important ways.  Notably, it moves beyond the older field’s emphasis on judges, courts, and formal legal systems.  New Legal Realism examines law in people’s everyday lives, using an interdisciplinary combination of current social science methods.  It is characterized by a “ground-level up” perspective, which focuses on laypeople’s experiences with law as well as studying legal professionals and formal institutions. This fits well with the American pragmatist philosophical tradition.
In addition, NLR takes “law on the books” seriously as a subject of study, including it as part of the overall system of law.  The goal of NLR is to build an integrated social science research program on law that combines multiple methods and objects of study to give policymakers the most complete possible picture of how law operates.  This includes non-instrumental uses of law.

CATEGORIES: Agaricus, Edible fungi, Fungi described in 1873, Fungi of North America, Secotioid fungi

Agaricus deserticola, commonly known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the Agaricaceae family. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A. deserticola is adapted for growth in dry or semi-arid habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A. deserticola does not develop true gills, but rather a convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.
The fruit bodies can reach heights of [tpl]convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tall with caps that are up to [tpl]convert|7.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. The tough woody stems are [tpl]convert|1|–|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] wide, thickening towards the base. Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground in fields, grasslands, or arid ecosystems. Other mushrooms with which A. deserticola might be confused include the desert fungus species Podaxis pistillaris and Montagnea arenaria. The edibility of Agaricus deserticola mushrooms is not known definitively.
Formerly named Longula texensis (among several other synonyms), the fungus was transferred to the genus Agaricus in 2004 after molecular analysis showed it to be evolutionary related to species in that genus. In 2010, its specific epithet was changed to deserticola after it was discovered that the name Agaricus texensis was illegitimate, having been previously published for a different species.

[[Simplicial map]]

CATEGORIES: Algebraic topology

In the mathematical discipline of simplicial homology theory, a simplicial map is a map between simplicial complexes with the property that the images of the vertices of a simplex always span a simplex. Note that this implies that vertices have vertices for images.
Simplicial maps are thus determined by their effects on vertices.  In particular, there are a finite number of simplicial maps between two given finite simplicial complexes.
Simplicial maps induce continuous maps between the underlying polyhedra of the simplicial complexes: one simply extends linearly using barycentric coordinates.
Simplicial maps which are bijective are called simplicial isomorphisms.

The species was first formally described in 1855 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. He gave it the name Duttonia gibbifolia. In 1859 he transferred the species into the genus Eremophila.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=Eremophila gibbifolia|title=Eremophila gibbifolia |accessdate=2010-01-09 |work= Australian Plant Name Index (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra[/tpl]

Adolf Patera (11 July 1819 Vienna - 26 June 1894), was a Bohemian chemist, mineralogist and metallurgist, best known for the important role he played in the utilisation of uranium in colour production in glass, and associated with silver extraction from the mines at Joachimsthal, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now known as Jáchymov. Pateraite, supposedly a cobalt molybdate, is named after him.http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~rochlin/ushist.htmlhttp://www.mindat.org/min-32659.html
Patera studied at the Academy in Banská Štiavnica between 1839 and 1843.
Toward the mid-19th century the rich silver ore of Joachimsthal had been almost exhausted and instead miners encountered a heavy black mineral which they named "Pechblende". Martin Heinrich Klaproth, a chemist, found that it could be used in dye industry. This happened shortly after the discovery of Uranus and Klaproth dubbed the black uranium oxide powder "uranium", mistakenly believing it to be an element. Adolf Patera was asked to examine the commercial possibilities of the new substance, and he presented a paper on the use of uranium to the Imperial Academy of Science in 1847, also describing a method of vanadium extraction from the uranium ores. 
This led to the construction of a new factory which started production in 1853 of uranium pigments (sodium, potassium and ammonium diuranates, uranium oxides) for the production of uranium glass from high-grade pitchblende in a process developed by Patera. The process resulted in waste with a high radium content and was used by Pierre and Marie Curie in their separation of radium. The lustrous fire-resistant dyes coming in so many shades of yellow, black, orange and green became extremely popular and they were used as a matter of course for Czech glass and porcelain decoration, with burgeoning exports to Great Britain and France. Uranium glass is considered to be harmless and only marginally more active than background radiation.

According to Jami al-Tawarikh ("Compendium of Chronicles") by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, Qun-Quran was the fourth son of Orda, the eldest son of Jochi.
In 1256 a contingent of the Golden Horde under Qun Quran's eldest brother Kuli dispatched in Persia to assist Hulagu. Sometime after the Siege of Baghdad (1258), Kuli died in uncertain circumstances which constrained the Jochids' relationship with the Ilkhanate. During his rule, some descendants of Orda supported the election of Ariq Böke and sided with him in the Toluid Civil War against Kublai in the early 1260s.
When he died, he left no male heir. Therefore, his nephew Köchü succeeded him.

[[Bulleribock]]
CATEGORIES: Party games

Bulleribock or bulleri bock is a Swedish children's guessing game for two people.
The game is played as follows: person A turns his back to person B, who taps both hands rhythmically on A's back while saying a rhythmic, rhymed chant: Bulleri, bulleri bock, hur många horn står opp? (lit. bulleri, bulleri billy goat, how many horns are standing up?). B then stops drumming, but keeps some of his fingertips on A:s back. A then guesses how many fingers are pressed against his back. B responds with a chant corresponding to the right or the wrong answer, and the persons switch roles.
Bulleribock was described in Nordlander (1886) where a number of slightly different varieties of the chant from different parts of Sweden and Swedish-speaking Finland were attested.Nordlander, Johan. 1886. Svenska barnvisor och barnrim, vol 1, p. 115-116. It is still a popular game among young children in Sweden.Widerberg, Gertrud. 1993.

Liotulf, Ljotolf,Mackenzie 1903: pp. 29, 55. and Ljotulf.MacLeod 1927: pp. 1–2.|group=note[/tpl] is a minor character in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga, who is purported to have flourished in the mid-12th century. The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney. It depicts Ljótólfr as a nobleman who lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. During the 12th century, the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.
The Orkneyinga saga relates how Ljótólfr was a friendly acquaintance of the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, who is one of the major characters of the entire saga. The saga states that Ljótólfr housed Sveinn for some time on Lewis, and took in Sveinn's brother, who was banished from Orkney. Ljótólfr's son, Fugl, appears in the saga, although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's negotiates peace between the two. Several historians have considered Ljótólfr to be an ancestor of Clan MacLeod; one of these considered Ljótólfr to be the eponymous ancestor of the clan—although the current understanding of the clan's ancestry regards another man as the eponym.

[[Year 2000 problem]]
CATEGORIES: Time formatting and storage bugs, Calendars, COBOL, Software bugs, 2000 in computer science, Hazards

The Year 2000 problem (also known as the Y2K problem, the Millennium bug, the Y2K bug, or simply Y2K) was a problem for both digital (computer-related) and non-digital documentation and data storage situations which resulted from the practice of abbreviating a four-digit year to two digits.
In 1997, The British Standards Institute (BSI) developed a standard, DISC PD2000-1,BSI Standard, on year 2000 which defines "Year 2000 Conformity requirements" as four rules:
It identifies two problems that may exist in many computer programs.
Firstly, the practice of representing the year with two digits becomes problematic with logical error(s) arising upon "rollover" from x99 to x00. This has caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed "event horizons". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the "... 97, 98, 99, 00 ..." ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.
Secondly, some programmers had misunderstood the rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are leap years, and assumed the year 2000 would not be a leap year. Although most years divisible by 100 are not leap years, if they are divisible by 400 then they are. Thus the year 2000 was a leap year.
Companies and organizations worldwide checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems.
The number of computer failures that occurred when the clocks rolled over into 2000 in spite of remedial work is not known; amongst other reasons is the reticence of organisations to report problems.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm| title=Was Y2K bug a boost?|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=4 January 2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 September 2009|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm|archivedate=22 April 2004[/tpl]

The ångström is often used in the natural sciences and technology to express the sizes of atoms, molecules, and microscopic biological structures, the lengths of chemical bonds, the arrangement of atoms in crystals, the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, and the dimensions of integrated circuit parts. Atoms of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine are 1 Å in covalent radius, while a hydrogen atom is 0.25 Å; see atomic radius.
The unit was named after the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Ångström (1814–1874). The symbol is always written with a ring diacritic, as in the Swedish letter. Although the unit's name is often written in English without the diacritics,Webster′s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''.

The Dampfzentrale ("steam center") is a cultural centre and music venue and former fossil fuel power plant in Bern, Switzerland.
The power plant was built in 1904 by architect Eduard Joos on behalf of the municipal authorities. Its coal boilers were complemented with diesel generators in 1924. In 1939, coal power generation ceased and the [tpl]convert|50|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] high chimney was demolished. In 1973, the power plant was shut down and the building was used for storage.
The city's decision in 1981 to demolish the building was not carried out due to legal action by the authorities responsible for the preservation of historical monuments, and due to protests by cultural activists who wanted to use the site as a cultural venue and who occupied it without permission in 1987.
The authorities relented and granted permission for the Dampfzentrale to be used as a cultural venue with public subsidies. From 1997 to 1999, the site was thoroughly refurbished, made subject to professional management and complemented with a restaurant. In 2008, with an increase in subsidies, the Dampfzentrale was realigned as a center for contemporary dance and music.
Apart from several stages, the Dampfzentrale contains practice rooms for local artists. In its main stage, which holds 400 spectators, more than 500 events take place each year, including the annual dance festival Berner Tanztage.  In 2002, the Dampfzentrale was awarded the annual prize for culture, worth CHF 100,000, by the Burgergemeinde Bern.

By the outbreak of World War II, the Nazi party's foreign countries organization (NSDAP/AO) sought to organize German citizens abroad, and managed to enroll between 3% and 9% of the German citizens in the American countries.[tpl]cite book|title=Transatlantic relations series.

False American media reports also contributed to this public misperception of Germans in the Americas.
After Pearl Harbor, the US' FBI drafted a list of Germans in fifteen Latin American states it suspected of subversive activities and demanded their eviction to the US for detention. From these countries, 4,058 Germans were expelled accordingly. Among them were 10% to 15% Nazi party members, including some dozen NSDAP/AO recruiters and eight people suspected of espionage.[tpl]cite book|title=Transatlantic relations series.

The bulk were ordinary Germans, who were residents in these states for years or decades. Some were expelled because corrupt Latin American officials took the opportunity to seize their property, or ordinary Latin Americans were after the financial reward for denunciation paid by the US intelligence. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico did not participate in the US expulsion program. Besides the Germans evicted to the US, national internment camps for Axis citizens were set up in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as in the Panama Canal Zone. The US internment camps to which Germans from Latin America were directed were in Texas (camps Crystal City, Kennedy, Seagoville), Florida (Camp Blanding), Oklahoma (Stringtown), North Dakota (Fort Lincoln), Tennessee (Camp Forrest) and other sites.

[[Festgesang]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Felix Mendelssohn, Cantatas, 1840 compositions, German patriotic songs

The Festgesang (Gutenberg cantata), also known as Festgesang zur Eröffnung der am ersten Tage der vierten Säkularfeier der Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst, was composed by Felix Mendelssohn in the first half of 1840 for performance in Leipzig at the celebrations to mark the putative quatercentenary of the invention of printing with movable type by Johannes Gutenberg. It was first performed in the market-square at Leipzig on 24 June 1840.Todd, R. Larry, Mendelssohn: a life in music (Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 396). 
The piece is scored for male chorus with two brass orchestras and timpani, and consists of four parts, the first and last based on established Lutheran chorales. Part 2, beginning “Vaterland, in deinen Gauen”, was later adapted to the words of Wesley’s Christmas carol Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. The original German words for the Festgesang were by Adolf Eduard Proelss (1803–1882). The use of a large choir and two orchestras was designed to make use of the natural acoustics of the market-place to produce an impressive, resonant sound. 
Mendelssohn wrote at least two other Festgesänge, with which the present work are sometimes confused, known as Festgesang an die Künstler (1846) and Festgesang (“Möge das Siegeszeichen”) (1838).Cooper, John Michael, “Mendelssohn’s works: prolegomenon to a comprehensive inventory” in Seaton, Douglas, The Mendelssohn companion (Westport, Conn. and London: Greenwood Press, 2001, p. 721).

Hedgebrook's global community of alumnae, more than 1,200 writers from all over the world, include celebrated author Gloria Steinem. Hedgebrook's Creative Advisory Council, helmed by Steinem and poet Carolyn Forché, includes: playwright and creator of The Vagina Monologues Eve Ensler, novelists Nassim Assefi, Mary Gordon, Ruth Ozeki and Sarah Waters, poets Naomi Shihab Nye and Suheir Hammad, playwright Ellen McLaughlin, memoirist Honor Moore, non-fiction writers Pramila Jayapal and Holly Morris, mystery writer Elizabeth George and solo performer Sarah Jones[tpl]dn|date=January 2013[/tpl].
Hedgebrook's Master Classes offer women writers the unique opportunity to study with renowned women writers such as Jane Hamilton, Theresa Rebeck, Karen Joy Fowler, Victoria Redel, Claire Dederer and Robin Swicord. The week-long writing workshops, offered in a variety of genres (fiction, memoir, playwriting, screenwriting, poetry), focus on different aspects of the writer's craft and process.
The annual Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival (HWPF) celebrates the work of women writing for the theatre. Since the festival’s inauguration in 1998, HWPF has supported the work of an impressive array of women playwrights and served an important role in the development of new plays by women. The festival begins with a “pre-retreat” weekend, in which the playwrights have the opportunity to get to know one another, hear each other’s plays read aloud, and share responses with an intimate group of theatre professionals in a relaxed, convivial atmosphere. This is followed by a two-week retreat at Hedgebrook, where each playwright has her own private cottage, a dramaturg on-call, and the opportunity to work in Hedgebrook’s unique combination of solitude and community. The retreat is capped off with public presentations of excerpts from each play. 
Participation in the Hedgebrook Women Playwrights Festival is by invitation in collaboration with partner theatres from around the country. In recognition of the fact that fewer than 20% of the plays produced each year on US stages are by women, Hedgebrook is partnering with theatres who show their commitment to women playwrights through commissions, development and production opportunities. In this way, Hedgebrook forges opportunities for women playwrights to deepen their relationships with theatres and is becoming a major pipeline for plays by women to move from creation to development and production. Current partners include: Denver Theatre Center, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Seattle's ACT Theatre, Chicago's Goodman Theatre and Center Theatre Group, Los Angeles.
HWPF plays have gone on to productions around the country. Alumnae include:
Lynn Nottage (2000), recipient of the 2009 Pulitzer prize for drama for Ruined
Theresa Rebeck (2001), prolific playwright, screenwriter, and novelist
Caridad Svich (2002, 2007), recipient of the 2012 OBIE Award for Lifetime Acheivement, recipient of the 2011 American Theatre Critics Association Primus Prize

Charles Edwin Benham JP (pronounced Ben-am; 15 April 1860 in Colchester, Essex, England - 1 April 1929, also in Colchester) was a journalist, editing for many years the Essex County Standard, a published author of works such as Essex Ballads and an amateur scientist-cum-inventor, which led him to create Benham's top, which was named after him.
Born on 15 April 1860 into a family of newspaper proprietors, Benham was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School but did not attend university.[tpl]Cite book|quote=Seine Schulbildung empfing er in der Grammar School des Geburtsortes; eine Universität hat er nicht besucht|language=German|title=Der sprachgebrauch des dialettdichters Charles E.

He left a widow.
In the spare time that this provided, Benham was a keen amateur scientist and contributor to the journal Nature. His obituary in Nature noted that Benham was "a representative of the type of scientific amateur of which British science has reason to be proud... by faithful observation and original mind he was able to make some notable contributions to knowledge."[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v123/n3104/abs/123651a0.html|journal=Nature|title=Mr. C.

The disc, when spun, produces vivid and coloured images of concentric circles (Fechner colours), despite neither of these being present in the design.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Blom | first1 = Jan | title = A Dictionary of Hallucinations | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = | isbn = 1-4419-1222-3 | pages = 60–1[/tpl]
Additionally, Benham contributed an essay defending the reputation of William Gilbert, asserting that "though Gilbert's actual discoveries were few and crude, he must be judged rather by the spirit of his work." Other contributions were plentiful in the areas of optics and fluorescence. His exploits were also described in KnowledgeSee, for example, [tpl]cite journal|first=Charles E.|last=Benham|title=Miniature harmonographs|journal=Knowledge|volume=3|pages=452–454|year=1906[/tpl] and the (English) Journal of Botany
.See, for example, "Ferns Grown Under Bottles" (1924) as described in the American Fern Journal. The invention of a "miniature twin elliptic pendulum harmonograph" was also credited to him.

[[Hasta pura (military decoration)]]

CATEGORIES: Military awards and decorations of ancient Rome

The Hasta Pura or Hasta Donatica was a decoration for merit, awarded in Ancient Rome.[ref]See the German Source on http://www.gottwein.de/latine/LLLh1.php
"hasta Lanze, Stoßwaffe im Gegensatz zum Pilum, hasta pura Ehrenlanze, die einen Schaft aus Edelmetall und statt einer Spitze einen Knauf hatte. Sie wurde als Auszeichnung für Tapferkeit vergeben. (Source: Suetonius.Claud.28,1).[/ref] The Roman sources do not concur about the precise character of the decoration. Some call it a decoration for valour, others mention that it has been awarded to civilians.
The hasta was a thrusting weapon that was not thrown as were the later pilum, verutum or lancea. A hasta pura was a spear made "without iron"Pliny. 7, 28, 29, § 102Suet. Claud. 28Lewis&Short at Perseus and was in the earliest times the reward of a soldier the first time that he conquered in battle.Serv. ad Virg. Æn. vi. 760 Later it came to be awarded to a soldier who had struck down an enemy in a sally or skirmish.Lips. ad Polyb. de Milit. Rom. v. 17[tpl]cite book|last=Rev. John Selby Watson, M.A.|title=Sallust. The Jugurthine War.|year=1899|publisher=Harper & Brothers.|location=Perseus project|pages=Footnotes to Sal. Jug. 85|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0126:chapter=85&highlight=pura[/tpl]
Tacitus records a hasta pura being given as a decoration, bestowed upon a soldier for saving the life of a fellow-citizen:
A civil servant called Tiberius Claudius Balbilus was awarded the hasta pura and perhaps also the corona aurea by Claudius during the Triumph to celebrate the conquest of Britain in 44AD.(Source: Suetonius.Claud.28,1). As a friend and part of the Emperor’s retinue, it seems likely that his awards, as much as his military rank, were honorary.See http://www.legioxx.org.uk/xxdona.html Maxfield 1981, 160-161 It is also mentioned in the article Hasta (spear).
The hasta pura was also recorded as being given to the Primus Pilus when he had completed his period of service.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Also, such a gift is sometimes recorded in funereal inscriptions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
Some have taken "without iron" to mean that the hasta pura had no head at all. The main evidence in support of this conjecture is that representations on some coins show a blunt spear. However, other coins clearly show a sharp spearhead and those that do not may be explained by poorly made coins or poorly drawn representations of them in publications.[tpl]sfn|Maxfield|1992|pp=85-86[/tpl] The hasta pura is mentioned in the second part of the Claudius novels by Robert Graves. Graves calls the decoration an "Arrow without a head", and refers to its award to Balbilus.See Claudius the God and his Wife Messalina. London: Arthur Barker, 1934; New York: Smith & Haas, 1935.

The inaugural competition was held in Gweedore, County Donegal in 1969,http://www.sportsmanager.i/cake/gaa2/donegal/contentPage/10698/Honours with the local club Gaoth Dobhairhttp://www.clgghaothdobhair.com/Notai.asp?id=130&page=43 being crowned as champions. From 1975 onwards, the competition has also been contested at junior level.
RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta provides extensive radio coverage of both the regional qualifiers and the national finals, held over the June Bank Holiday. TG4 provides live television coverage of the finals on the June Bank Holiday Monday and these are also webcast world wide online.

[[William Lander]]

CATEGORIES: Confederate States of America political leaders, 1817 births, 1868 deaths

William Lander (May 8, 1817 - January 8, 1868) was a prominent North Carolina politician.  He was born in County Tipperary, Ireland, eldest son of Samuel and Eliza Miller Lander. Samuel Lander emigrated to Boston in 1818. A few years later Eliza, William, and his older sister Anne also came to America. The family moved southward and by about 1825 had settled in Lincoln County, North Carolina. 
William was educated at the Lincolnton Academy and then attended the Methodist school in Cokesbury, South Carolina.  In 1839 he married Sarah Tillman Connor of Cokesbury. He returned to Lincolnton and read law with Col. James R. Dodge. Soon after his admission to the bar Mr. Lander was elected county solicitor. In 1852 he became a state legislator and was a leader in the Democratic Party's effort to remove land ownership as a condition of suffrage. In that same year the Legislature elected him Solicitor for his judicial district. 
He was chairman of the North Carolina delegation to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston. The North Carolina delegation did not walk out of this convention when the delegates from seven deep South states did so. When the temporarily adjourned convention reassembled in Baltimore in June 1860, the North Carolina and Virginia delegations continued to participate for as long as they felt that an acceptable nomination was possible.  After the Virginians took their leave, William Lander made these remarks upon the withdrawal of his delegation "The South has heretofore relied upon the Northern Democracy to give us the rights which are justly due us, but the vote today has satisfied the majority of the North Carolina delegation that these rights are now refused and this being the case, we can no longer remain in this convention."  He supported Breckenridge in the presidential campaign that followed and during a debate with Zebulon B. Vance, who supported the Whig ticket, he said he did not think that the election of Lincoln would in itself be a cause for secession but that it was impossible to judge the consequences which might surround such an event, and he held himself ready to cast his lot with North Carolina whatever that might be.  
After the election of Abraham Lincoln, North Carolina was slow to consider secession and in a referendum a majority of citizens voted against calling a convention. However, after the attack upon Fort Sumter the Legislature did finally call for a convention. William Lander was the delegate from Lincoln and he cast his vote for secession.  He was elected without opposition to serve in the First Confederate Congress from 1862 to 1864, representing Lincoln and seven other counties.  As a member of the congress, he spoke in support of a state's right to secede and in support of the controversial Conscription Act.  In announcing his candidacy for reelection in 1862, he said "I desire peace as ardently as anyone and shall use every honorable means to secure it, yet I will consent to no adjustment which does not bring with it the independence of the Confederate States, their total separation from the United States and all the blessings of liberty to which we are entitled by inheritance."  He was considered a member of the "peace" element of the party and was one of seven  of the State's ten congressmen who did not win reelection.
William Lander did not again hold public office, but continued to practice law in Lincolnton.  
His wife died in 1863. They had six sons and three daughters.

The Central Guoshu Institute  ([tpl]zh|t=中央國術館 |s= 中央国术馆|p=zhōng yāng guó shù guǎn|l=Central Martial Arts Academy[/tpl]); was established in Nanjing by the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China in 1928 for the propagation of Chinese martial arts, and was an important center of martial arts during the Nanjing decade. 
Guoshu (also spelled Kuoshu) [tpl]lang|zh|國術[/tpl] "national art" was the term for martial arts adopted by the Republic of China at the time. 
The institute was headed by five selected masters, including Fu Chen Sung, Wan Lai Sheng, Gu RuZhang, Li Lie Jun 李烈鈞 (1882–1946), Li Jinglin (李景林, 1884–1931),*[tpl]cite book|last=Lutang|first=Sun|title=A Study of Taijiquan|year=2003|page=31|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1-55643-462-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DVqGOf1WB9EC&pg=PA31|author2=Tim Cartmell|accessdate=22 October 2010[/tpl] *[tpl]cite book|last=Vercammen|first=Dan|title=When God comes to town: religious traditions in urban contexts|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-554-5|pages=114–44 125|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RmuX5nwX2hoC&pg=PA126|editor=Rik Pinxten, Lisa Dikomitis|accessdate=23 October 2010|chapter=Modernity Contra Tradition?

In April 1928, The Institute held its first national martial arts competition in Beijing in the form of a highly competitive lei tai tournament. It was presided by General Zhang Zhi Jiang. This competition attracted 400 of the best martial artists in China.*[tpl]cite book|last=Lin|first=Chao Zhen|title=Fu Zhen Song's Dragon Bagua Zhang|year=2010|pages=38–39|publisher=Blue Snake Books|isbn=978-1-58394-238-3[/tpl]
In October 1928, the Central Guoshu Institute held another national examination in Nanjing. This event came to be regarded as one of the most significant historic gatherings of Chinese martial arts masters. The tournament was presided by generals Zhang Zhi Jiang, Li Lie Jun, and Li Jing Lin, who separated the 600 participants into two categories: Shaolin and Wudang.[tpl]cite book|author=Sun Lu Tang|title=Xing Yi Quan Xue|year=2000|page=3|publisher=Unique Publications|isbn=0-86568-185-6[/tpl]
After the first several days of competition, the fighting competitions had to be halted because two masters were killed and many more seriously injured. The final 12 contestants were not permitted to continue for fear of losing traditional knowledge of martial arts by killing off the experts and the overall winner was voted on by a jury of his peers. Many of the "Top 15" finishers (some being Xingyi boxers) went on to teach at the institute.Yang, Jwing Ming and Jefferey A. Bolt. Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu.

In 1929, the governor of Guangdong Province invited some of the institutes's masters (including some of those that had competed in the 1928 lei tai) to come south to establish a "Southern Kuoshu Institute". General Li Jinglin chose five masters to represent northern China: BaguaZhang master, Fu Chen Sung; Shaolin Iron Palm master, Gu Ru Zhang; Six Harmony master Wan Lai Shen; Tam T'ui master, Li Shan Wu; and Cha Chuan master, Wang Shao Zhao. These men were known as the Wu hu xia jiangnan (五虎下江南 - "Five tigers heading south of Jiangnan"). In 1933, the institute again hosted the national competition. The rules said, "...if death occurs as a result of boxing injuries and fights, the coffin with a body of the deceased will be sent home."Origins and the development of Praying Mantis Boxing

[[Mancini List]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties in Calabria

Mancini List (Lista Mancini) was a regional social-democratic political party active in Calabria. The party was often referred to as PSE, Italian acronym for the Party of European Socialists and was led by Giacomo Mancini.
When the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) was dissolved in 1994, Mancini, a long-time politician, secretary of the PSI from 1970 to 1972 and Mayor of Cosenza since 1993, launched the party as a vehicle for local elections. In 1996 Mancini was re-elected Mayor of Cosenza also with the support of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and other centre-left parties: he won 58.8% of the vote and the combined result of his personal list and the local Italian Socialists (SI) was 21.1%.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/novembre/18/Mancini_Cosenza_laboratorio_per_riqualificare_co_0_9711186240.shtml Since that point PSE and PDS, which was transformed into the Democrats of the Left (DS) in 1998, formed a pact at the national level, under which Giacomo Mancini Jr., grandson of Mancini, was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in 2001.http://leg14.camera.it/organiparlamentari/assemblea/contenitore_dati.asp?tipopagina=&deputato=0d300422&source=%2Fdeputatism%2F240%2Fdocumentoxml.asp&Pagina=Deputati/Composizione/01.camera/nuovacomposizione/datpersonali2.asp%3Fdeputato=d300422&position=Organi%20Parlamentari%5Cgruppi%20parlamentari
When Mancini died in 2002, Mancini Jr. succeeded him as party leader, while Eva Catizone, was elected Mayor of Cosenza in his place. In 2005 Mancini Jr. left the DS and led the party to a merger with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI), while Catizone joined the Southern Democratic Party (PDM). In 2006 Mancini Jr. was re-elected to the Chamber for the Rose in the Fist,http://www.socialisti.net/archivio49/00001af2.htm a joint list of the SDI and the Italian Radicals, but failed to be re-elected in 2008.
In the 2000 regional election the party obtained only 1.5% of the vote in Calabria, but, five years later, it contributed to the good result of the SDI (6.8%) also with some elects. However the stronghold of the party has always been Cosenza, where even in 2002 it obtained 12.4% of the vote as late as in 2002.http://www.cattaneo.org/archivi/adele/comuni/com02capoluoghi.xls In 2006 Mancini Jr. won 29.9% of the vote in Cosenza municipal election, bringing the Rose in the Fist to 15.4% in the city, a record in Italy, and his personal list to 7.5%, but was defeated, ending the 13-year rule of the Mancini family in Cosenza.http://www.repubblica.it/speciale/2006/elezioni/comunali/cosenza.html
In November 2008 Mancini Jr. left the Socialist Party (PS), the successor party of the SDI, and joined Forza Italia (FI) and, thus, The People of Freedom (PdL), declaring that that party was the natural home for social democrats in Italy, as the PS was a failure and the Democratic Party (PD) was too weak in front of populist Italy of Values (IdV) and far from being a centre-left reform party.http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/266747/denis-verdini-fabrizio-cicchitto-e-daniele-capezzone-annunciano-lingresso-di-giacomo-mancini-nel-popolo-dehttp://www.giacomomancini.it/dettaglio.asp?id=3164 Mancini received more than 60,000 votes but failed to get elected.http://europee.interno.it/europee/euro090607/prefET4.htm#03424

[[Robert McDonald Jones]]
CATEGORIES: 1808 births, 1872 deaths, Confederate States of America political leaders

Robert McDonald Jones (October 1, 1808 - February 22, 1872) was a member of the Choctaw Nation, Pro-Tempore of the Choctaw Senate, and prominent Confederate politician. He was born in Mississippi and later relocated to Indian Territory.  He was educated at the Choctaw Academy in Blue Springs, Kentucky, where he received a diploma signed by future Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson.
During the removal of Choctaws to Indian Territory accepted a contract and worked as translator for the United States to the tribe.  He also led a removal party that included a large party of livestock.  After removal, Jones opened several trading posts along the Red River.  In addition to stores, Jones ran several large plantation, growing cotton and several other crops.  In 1849, Jones exported 700 bales of cotton, which he shipped to New Orleans in one of his two Steamships ("RM Jones" and "Frances").  Jones built two sprawling mansions on his plantations Lake West and Rose Hill, complete with luxurious furnishings from around the world.  According to the 1860 census, Jones owned over 230 slaves, though some have argued that he owned as many as 500.
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Jones argued vehemently for secession and an alliance between the Choctaws and Confederacy. He represented the Choctaw nation in the First Confederate Congress from 1862 to 1864.  Following the War, he served as a Choctaw delegate in Washington DC in negotiating the Treaty of 1866 between the Choctaws and the United States; however, he refused to sign the treaty and left before it was complete.
He died from malaria in 1872 and was buried outside his Rose Hill estate alongside several of his children who died in infancy and his second wife, Susan Colbert Jones. Unfortunately Rose Hill later burned, destroying much of his letters and papers.  In 1933, a dedication of the Jones graveyard, including the installation of a brick-wall with the stones from the house, was performed by the Oklahoma Historical Society.

[[Wide Eyed (Nichole Nordeman album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1998 debut albums, Nichole Nordeman albums, Sparrow Records albums

Wide Eyed is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Nichole Nordeman, released on September 22, 1998 by Star Song Records and Sparrow Records. After winning a songwriting competition hosted by the Gospel Music Association in 1998, Nordeman signed a record deal with Star Song and Sparrow and began to work on her debut record. A ten song set, Wide Eyed sees her collaborating with Mark Hammond to co-write the tracks for the album, which he also produced. Describing it as having a piano-driven sound, Nordeman cites the facet of honesty as the Wide Eyed[tpl]'[/tpl]s main theme — using theological and philosophical concepts to write its lyrical content.
Upon its release, Wide Eyed received a moderate amount of positive response to music critics. Nordeman's lyrics and vocal performance received particular praise, while criticism targeted the musical accompaniment. The album had a modest amount of commercial success. After entering the Billboard Christian Albums chart at number 16, Wide Eyed went on to sell over 130,000 copies in the United States. All of its singles, "To Know You", "Who You Are", "I Wish the Same for You", and the titular track, became top 40 hits on the Christian adult contemporary radio. To support Wide Eyed, Nordeman emarked on The a Tour as a opening act for the musical groups Avalon and Anointed.

[[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball records]]
CATEGORIES: College men's basketball records and statistics in the United States, North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball

The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program is a college basketball program considered to be "one of the dominant basketball teams in NCAA history." The Tar Heels have won five NCAA tournament championships in 1957, 1982, 1993, 2005 and 2009, and were retroactively named the national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation for their undefeated season in 1924. The program is well known for its famous alumni, such as Michael Jordan, coaching history, and a rivalry with Duke (a team located only eight miles away in Durham, North Carolina). The rivalry is regarded as one of the most intense in all of sports.
From the Tar Heels' first season in 1910-11 through the 2008-09 season, the Tar Heels amassed a 73.8% all-time winning percentage (second highest in NCAA Division I history), winning 1,984 games and losing 703 games in 99 seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 seasons from the 1970–71 seasons through 2000–2001 season.
On January 21, 2007, North Carolina became only the second college basketball program to reach 1,900 wins in its history. The University of Kentucky was the only previous school to reach this mark. The Kansas Jayhawks have since become the third team to reach 1,900 wins.
The Tar Heels have won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament five times, have appeared in the NCAA finals eight times, have participated in a record 18 NCAA Final Fours, have made it into the NCAA tournament 41 times (tied for second-most all-time), and hold the record for all-time NCAA Tournament victories (100). North Carolina also won the National Invitation Tournament tournament in 1971, has appeared in two NIT Semifinals, and has made five appearances in the NIT Tournament. Additionally, the team has been the number one seed in the NCAA Tournament 13 times, the latest being in 2009 (most #1 seeds all-time), and has the most consecutive top-3 ACC finishes with 37. North Carolina has had a top twenty-five final ranking among Division I schools 42 times as ranked by the Associated Press and 44 times as ranked by the Coaches Poll.  In five instances the North Carolina Tar Heels have ended the season with a number one ranking in the Associated Press, and the North Carolina Tar Heels have also been ranked number one five times at the end of the season by the Coaches' Poll. In 2008 the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll, as well as the first unanimous preseason #1 ranking in the history of the Associated Press Poll.
Here is a list of records for the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program.

Philip Glass' Violin Concerto No. 2, titled The American Four Seasons, received its world premiere in Toronto on December 9, 2009, with violinist Robert McDuffie, for whom the work was composed, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra under conductor Peter Oundjian. Its European premiere was in London on April 17, 2010, with McDuffie and the London Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Marin Alsop.http://shop.lpo.org.uk/performances/detail.asp?3829,63,0,0,0
Glass composed the work in the summer and autumn of 2009 after several years of exchanges between him and McDuffie with the idea of creating a piece that would serve as a companion to Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. When the work was presented to McDuffie, it emerged that his interpretation of the seasons was somewhat different from Glass'. For this reason, Glass presents this as an opportunity for the listener to make his/her own interpretation. The titles of the movements therefore offer no clues as to where Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter might fall, with the composer welcoming other interpretations.
Instead of the cadenza typically found in most violin concertos, Glass provided a number of solo pieces for the violinist which act as a prelude to the first movement, and three 'songs' that precede each of the following three movements. Glass also anticipated that these could be played together as separate concert music when abstracted from the whole work.
This concert is now in the repertoire of the Kremerata Baltica and was played for the first time in San José, Costa Rica with  Gidon Kremer as soloist in August, 2013.Testimonial

[[British Banking School]]

CATEGORIES: History of economic thought

The British Banking School was a group of British 19th century economists who wrote on monetary and banking issues. They were created to oppose the British Currency School; they argued that currency issue could be naturally restricted by the desire of bank depositors to redeem their notes for gold. According to Jacob Viner[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1414&chapter=45564&layout=html&Itemid=27 Jacob Viner, Studies in the Theory of International Trade 1937 the main members of the Banking School were Thomas Tooke, John Fullarton, James Wilson, and J. W. Gilbart. They believed "The amount of paper notes in circulation was adequately controlled by the ordinary processes of competitive banking, and if the requirement of convertibility was maintained, could not exceed the needs of business for any appreciable length of time".  Thus they opposed the requirement in the Bank Act of 1844 for a reserve requirement on banknotes.

John Greenwall, also known as Johann Theodore Wild (1859 – December 6, 1889) was a German immigrant to New York City who became the last person to be hanged in New York State. He was hanged at Raymond Street Jail for shooting Lyman Smith Weeks dead during a burglary on March 15, 1887. 
A reward from the Mayor of Brooklyn was posted at $2,500, and Greenwall was arrested on April 5 along with several associates. Two trials in 1888 sought to disentangle the conflicting accounts of Greenwalls associates, while his lawyer argued that hanging was not a suitable punishment given that the electric chair was not the preferred method of execution, and the electric chair was not suitable given that the corresponding legislation had not been in place when the murder occurred. Greenwall was sentenced on December 5, 1889. "This information was at once conveyed to Greenwall, who received it without emotion. He had slept very little on Wednesday night, occupying most of his time playing checkers and penuchle with one of his keepers. He finally fell asleep about 3 a.m., but awoke with a start about 8 o’clock. ‘I shall sleep no more’, he said then. ‘I've only one day left, and after that I'll sleep enough'" reported the New York Times.
The report continued that: "The condemned man had retained his unnatural calm until a second before the black cap was drawn over his eyes. Then his face grew suddenly white and his pinioned knees trembled. Father O’Hara quickly placed a crucifix on Greenwall’s lips, and the latter kissed it passionately. The next instant “Joe” Atkinson had rapped sharply on the wooden partition concealing the 552 pounds of weights, a crash was heard, and Greenwall’s body was jerked into the air."
William Kemmler, the first to be executed in the electric chair, was killed in 1890, ending the use of the hangman's noose in New York State.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/the-hangmans-final-bow/|title=The Hangman's Final Bow|last=Newman|first=Andy|date=December 4, 2009|work=The Local|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]

The 2010 Oregon Ducks football team represented the University of Oregon in the 2010 college football season. The team was led by Chip Kelly in his second season as a head coach. The Ducks played their home games at Autzen Stadium for the 44th straight year.
On October 16, 2010, Oregon was ranked number 1 in the AP Poll for the first time in program history.  On October 31, 2010, after beating USC and moving to 8–0, Oregon achieved the number 1 ranking in the BCS rankings. The Ducks repeated as Pac-10 Conference champions and finished the regular season undefeated with a school-record 12 wins, the first undefeated and untied regular season in the school's 117-year football history. They earned a berth in the BCS National Championship Game, which they narrowly lost to Auburn on a field goal as time expired.  It was the closest that a team from the Pacific Northwest has come to winning a share of the national championship since Washington was crowned national champion by most outlets in 1991.
In recognition of the team's performance during the season, Kelly received the Eddie Robinson Award and the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award. Running back LaMichael James, who finished third in balloting in for the Heisman Trophy, received the Doak Walker Award.

Cyananthus is a genus that consists of about 30 species of annual or mostly perennial herbs from high mountains of Central and East Asia. They are little Himalayan plants not higher than 4in. The name comes from the Greek for blue flowers. Leaves are usually small and simple, sometimes narrowing to base, tooth-lobed at summit. In August to September, the plants bear showy of bright purplish-blue, yellow or white, funnel to bell-shaped, 5-lobed flowers 1in in diameter with stamens free from the corolla and hairy throat. The flowers are borne singly on stalks. They always lose the aerial parts during the coldest months, and as spring begins, stems and leaves quickly start to reproduce.

The Raymond Street Jail was a jail in Brooklyn, New York City. With its cornerstone laid in a ceremony on August 27, 1836, Raymond Street Jail was the chief prison for Brooklyn before the latter was incorporated into New York City, and was closed on July 20, 1963. When initially constructed, an oversight of planning resulted in there being no front door, with one having to be cut into the walls. Originally for male prisoners, a female wing was added in 1839. It underwent several phases of construction, and was rebuilt in 1879 and 1909.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.correctionhistory.org/html/museum/gallery/raymondst/return2raymondst.html|title=Return to Raymond St. Jail|publisher=Correction History|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl]

"Jane" Ebba Charlotta Horney (married Granberg), (8 July 1918 – 20 January 1945) was a Swedish woman, believed to have spied in Denmark for the benefit of Nazi Germany, and to have been killed by the Danish resistance movement on a fishing boat at Øresund, but it has never been confirmed for which nation she actually worked. The Gestapo in Denmark believed that she was an agent for the British or Soviet Union, and after World War II it was denied that she had been a Gestapo agent. Abwehr officers likewise denied, when inquired by Säpo (Swedish intelligence), that she had been their agent.Tore Pryser: Kvinner i hemmelig tjeneste (p. 193), edited by Cappelen, Oslo 2007, ISBN 978-82-02-27462-7

The 2010 American League Division Series (ALDS) were two best-of-five game series to determine the participating teams in the 2010 American League Championship Series.  The three divisional winners and a fourth "Wild Card" team (the team with the best record among teams not winning their division) played in two series from October 6 to 12.  TBS televised all games in the United States.2010 MLB Postseason Schedule
Under MLB's playoff format, no two teams from the same division were matched up in the Division Series, regardless of whether their records would normally indicate such a matchup. Home field advantage went to the team with the better regular-season record with the exception of the wild card team, which defers home field advantage regardless of record. The matchups for the 2010 ALDS were:
This was the second consecutive season and fourth season overall in which the Twins and Yankees met in the ALDS; the Yankees won all their previous series, 3–1 in 2003 and 2004, and 3–0 in 2009. The Rays and Rangers had never met previously in the postseason, with Tampa Bay making only their second postseason appearance in franchise history (after 2008) and Texas making their fourth appearance (and first since 1999).
The Rangers' win was the first postseason series victory in franchise history; the series also became the first MLB postseason series in which the visiting team won every game.[tpl]cite web|last=Sullivan|first=T.R. |title=CompleteLee!

Průkopník svobody ('Pioneer of Freedom') was a Czech language newspaper published from Vienna, Austria. Průkopník svobody appeared weekly between 1918 and 1926, and bi-weekly 1926-1929. The slogan of the newspaper was Workers of all countries, unite!
Průkopník svobody had been published as 'the organ of the Czech Social Democratic Workers (Centralists) in German Austria' ('Centralists' was a name used for the Czech Social Democrats who had belonged to the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria, rather than the Czechoslav Social Democratic Workers Party). The editorial board of Průkopník svobody belonged to the leftwing of the Austrian Social Democracy, and in 1920 the newspaper was identified as pro-Bolshevik in correspondence of the Communist International. From 1921 onwards, Průkopník svobody was the organ of the Czech communists in the Republic of Austria.Brev från Tjeckoslovakien, in Den Kommunistiska Internationalen N:o 1.

In 1941, Werzt rescued Jews from deportation to Poland by issuing confirmations of serious diseases for them. He acted out of humanitarian reasons and only charged a flat pro-forma ordination charge of 5 German Reichsmark from his Jewish patients.
One of the rescued was the Jew Gertrude Fritz, who, by arriving at Wertz already was referenced on a deportation list. Wertz certified her an abscess in her uterus and ordered her six weeks of bed rest. There were some Gestapo-physicians who came to her, but they believed the sickness certificate would be correct. During this time Gertrude Fritz was not deported.
Later, the Gestapo discovered Wertz' relief operation and he was convicted to a punishment battalion. He was not exempted till end of war and still lived till 1966.

After nine months of competing and the total of 17 eliminatory rounds of public voting, Svetlana Tanasic, although the oldest contestant in all seasons so far, finished the competition at the overall fourth place and as the best placed female singer in the season.

[[William Cole (antiquary)]]

CATEGORIES: 1714 births, 1782 deaths, English antiquarians, Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge, Deputy Lieutenants of Cambridgeshire

William Cole (August 3, 1714 - 16 December 1782), was a Cambridgeshire clergyman and antiquary.
Cole was born in Little Abington, Cambridgeshire, the son of a well-to-do farmer. He was educated at Eton, where he developed a lifelong friendship with Horace Walpole, and Cambridge University, first at Clare College and then at King's College.W.M. Palmer and J.D. Pickles 2007 William Cole of Milton. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
Having inherited a substantial estate on his father's death, Cole was not obliged to earn a living and stayed for 18 years at King's College, collecting historical information on the county of Cambridgeshire. He visited nearly all the churches in the county, making sketches of them and taking notes of monumental inscriptions and coats of arms (as well as local gossip); he made extensive transcriptions of the registers of the Bishops of Ely, court rolls, registers of wills, and other manuscripts relating to the county. He made a six-month voyage to Lisbon, Portugal, on his doctor's advice to recover his spirits following a disappointment, and also travelled to France, Flanders and Scotland.
In 1753 Cole became rector of Bletchley and turned his attention to the history of Buckinghamshire, but 13 years later he returned to Cambridgeshire and became curate of Waterbeach. In 1770 he left the church and moved to Milton, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. He rented a small farm from King's College and continued his work on the history of the Cambridgeshire. Cole never married, but lived with his manservant Tom Wood, a maidservant, and a number of animals including 2 horses and a pony, a dog called Busy, a cat, and a parrot. He enjoyed entertaining and lived well. During his later years he suffered from gout.
Cole died in 1782, aged 68. He left money for a new tower to be built at St Clement's church, Cambridge, where he was buried. He had published little, and left his manuscript volumes - over 100 of them - to the British Museum, where they have proved invaluable to people writing about the history of Cambridgeshire. Cole had kept a diary between 1765 and 1770, and in 1931 two volumes - one relating to a trip to France, and one to his time at Bletchley - were published. A nineteenth-century biographer described Cole as "one of the most learned men of the eighteenth century in his particular line, and the most industrious antiquary that Cambridgeshire has ever had, or is likely to have", while the verdict of a contemporary, Professor Michael Lort, was "..with all his oddities, he was a worthy and valuable man".
Thompson Cooper wrote an entry for William Cole in the 1887 Dictionary of National Biography, the text of which follows.

Rolf Martin Theodor Dahlgren (July 7, 1932 - February 14, 1987) was a Swedish-Danish botanist, professor at the University of Copenhagen from 1973 to his death.
Dahlgren was born in Örebro to apothecary Rudolf Dahlgren and wife Greta née Dahlstrand.Vem Är Vem - Skåne, Halland, Blekinge (ed. Åke Davidsson), 2nd edn.

In 1973, he became professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen. Here, he developed his system of Angiosperm classification, based on many more characters simultaneously than previous systems, most notably many chemical plant traits (see also chemotaxonomy). Although the system was first presented in Danish,[tpl]cite book|last=Dahlgren|first=Rolf|title=Angiospermernes taxonomi, vol. 1-4|year=1974–76|location=Copenhagen|publisher=Akademisk Forlag[/tpl] it rapidly gained widespread acceptance, particularly due to the instructive diagrams, socalled Dahlgrenograms. His work on family circumscription in the Monocotyledons, published with H. T.

[[Topcon RE Super]]

CATEGORIES: 135 film cameras, SLR cameras

The Topcon RE Super, or Beseler Topcon Super D in USA, was launched by Tokyo Kogaku KK in 1963 and manufactured until 1971, at which point it was upgraded to the Super D and again to Super DM the following year. General sale continued for several years. These later models have a shutter release lock lever on the shutter release collar. It is a professional oriented 35mm SLR camera that had a comprehensive range of accessories available. It has a removable pentaprism finder and focusing screen. It features the Exakta bayonet lens mount for interchangeable lenses. A special accessory shoe is situated at the base of the rewind knob with a standard PC sync. contact next to it. The release button is placed at the right-hand camera front, but it lacks a mirror-up facility. This was included on the upgraded versions. The standard lens is the RE. Auto-Topcor 1:1.4 f=5.8cm or the slightly slower 1:1.8 version. A battery-operated winder to be attached to the camera base was made available.
Some common features of 35mm SLR photography were first seen on the Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting a fraction of the light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.
Identifying the different models (elsewhere/USA)
All models were available in chrome or black enamel finish.
Tokyo Kogaku KK
Tokyo Kogaku KK launched their first 35mm SLR camera in 1957, about two years before the Nikon F and the Canonflex. This was the Topcon R that acquired the bayonet lens mount from the Exakta Varex camera from Ihagee in Dresden, successor to the Kine Exakta of 1936. It was also inspired by the Zeiss Ikon Contax S as well as the Japanese Miranda T - most obviously the body shape by the former, and the detachable finder prism by the latter. However, it was not until 1963 the Topcon name became famous by introducing the Topcon RE Super, an event that took the entire camera industry by surprise: This camera featured through-the lens (TTL) exposure metering, and at full lens aperture at that. The RE Super was fully prepared for professional work supported by a choice of lenses and accessories to complement it. The United States importer was the Charles Beseler Company and it was sold as the Beseler Topcon Super D.[tpl]cite book|title=The Register of 35mm Single Lens Reflex Cameras Second Ed.|author=Rudolph Lea|publisher=Wittig Books Hückelhoven|year=1993|isbn=3-88984-130-9[/tpl]

Scott paid his usual visit to the Platt & Colt Pharmacy in downtown Ithaca. Shop proprietor, Chester C. Platt, was church treasurer and he met often with Scott for conversation after services. Seeking refreshment for himself and the reverend, Platt asked his fountain clerk, DeForest Christiance, for two bowls of ice cream. But instead of serving the reverend plain vanilla, Platt took the bowls and topped each with cherry syrup and a candied cherry. The finished dish looked delightful and tasted delicious—so much so that the men felt obliged to name the new creation. After some debate, Scott suggested that it be named for the day it was created. Platt concurred and the first "Cherry Sunday" was born. |work=Ithaca Convention & Visitors Bureau |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-08-20[/tpl] He was the owner of the Ithaca Democrat, the Batavia Times, and the Madison Wisconsin Leader.

[[Ywama]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Shan State

Ywama village is located on the western side of Inle Lake, Shan State, Myanmar. The village is most easily accessible by boat from the town of Nyaung Shwe on the north side of the lake.
Nearly all the homes and buildings are constructed on piles driven into the lake bed. Residents travel around by canoe, but there are also numerous bamboo walkways and bridges over the canals running throughout. As such, there is no main street or square, but there are pagoda complexes and monasteries on built-up areas.
Ywama is part of the 5-day rotating market cycle of Inle (the market appears in a different location on the lake each day). Ywama's market takes place on the grounds of a pagoda complex. However, much of the commerce takes place on the water as merchants, their small boats loaded with handicrafts or produce, do business with locals and tourists. This floating market is a big draw to visitors of the lake.
The village is home to a monastery and a stupa, weaving, metal smithing, wood carving and umbrella workshops. There are also many "floating gardens" where farmers plant crops like tomatoes on floating mats of vegetation anchored in place with bamboo poles.
From the air, the area is so filled with floating vegetation that it appears more land than lake.
Ywama is just south of Nga Phe Kyaung (Jumping Cat Monastery) and north east of the Indein village the Shwe Indein Pagoda.

In 2002, he finished Tommy Storm, but publishers didn't want to publish it because he was an unknown author. Four years later, he self-published the book, making 5,000 copies. A few months later, when approximately 3,000 books were sold, Quercus bought the rights to publish it properly. He is now married with a young child in Dublin, Ireland.

[[Green Line (MARTA)]]

CATEGORIES: Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, Railway lines opened in 1992

The Green Line is a rapid transit line in the MARTA rail system.  It operates between Bankhead and Edgewood / Candler Park stations, running exclusively inside the Atlanta city limits.
The Green Line is a stub of the originally planned North Line, which would have served points north beyond Bankhead such as Northside Drive in Brookwood Hills, serving the Perry Homes projects along the way. But the line was only ever built as far as Bankhead.Atlanta: race, class, and urban expansion By Larry Keating
The Green Line was previously called the Proctor Creek Line until MARTA switched to a color-based naming system in October 2009.  The East-West Line, from its launch, was considered one line (denoted with the Blue Line color on old system maps) until 2006 when the West branch and the Proctor Creek branch were redesignated as the East-West Line (the current Blue Line) and the Proctor Creek Line (the current Green Line).
The rail line was part of the initial launch of MARTA rail service in 1979.  The first segment ran from the East Line segment from Georgia State to the Avondale stations upon the opening in June of that year.  By the end of 1979, it extended west to the Hightower station (now Hamilton E. Holmes) on the West Line segment, which serves as that station's terminus.  Although the North-South line was expanded throughout the 1980s, the East-West line did not see any extension since its opening until 1992 when the Proctor Creek branch of the line opened to its terminus at Bankhead station.  It finally extended to its current eastern terminus at Indian Creek the year after.
Now known as the Green Line, it shares trackage with its counterpart, the Blue Line, between just west of Ashby and Edgewood / Candler Park.
The Green Line service operates between Bankhead and Edgewood / Candler Park stations from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 a.m the again beginning at 3:00 p.m. until 9:00 p.m. on weekdays only, while it operates between Bankhead and King Memorial stations from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m.  On weekdays & on Saturday, Sunday & holiday, the Green Line operates between Bankhead and King Memorial stations all day until 9:00pm.
After 9:00 p.m., the Green Line service operates between Bankhead and Vine City stations only until the end of the service.

[[Herzberg–Seesen railway]]

CATEGORIES: Railway lines in Lower Saxony, Transport in the Harz

The Herzberg–Seesen railway, also known as the West Harz Line ([tpl]lang-de|Westharzstrecke[/tpl]), is a 32 km long railway line, that runs along the western edge of the Harz mountains and serves the town and the district of Osterode am Harz. It is the shortest link from Brunswick to Erfurt and is worked today by Lint multiples from Brunswick via Salzgitter, Seesen and Osterode to Herzberg mainly at hourly intervals. In Herzberg there are connexions to Göttingen and Nordhausen.
The line was opened in 1871 as a link between the South Harz Line and the Brunswick Southern Railway from Brunswick via Salzgitter to Kreiensen. It was planned as a long-distance route; and its trackbed laid for two tracks. This, however, did not materialise. Today it is operated as a branch line.
At the beginning of the 1990s the Herzberg–Seesen railway was threatened with closure. Since then, introducing of weekend services and of a Taktfahrplan has made it significantly more attractive to travellers. In 2004 two new stops were opened in Osterode (O. Leege and O. Mitte) because the halts there were not particularly well sited. Some stations, e.g. the historic station built of wood in Gittelde, were renovated. In the medium term the line should be controlled from an electronic signal box in Göttingen which is currently under construction.

The Neuekrug-Hahausen–Goslar railway is a double-tracked, non-electrified main line in Lower Saxony in central Germany. The line, which runs along the northern edge of the Harz mountains, begins in Goslar and forms a junction with the Brunswick–Kreiensen railway to Seesen and Kreiensen  at Neuekrug-Hahausen. Because the branch-off station is passed through nowadays without stopping, it is often called the Goslar–Seesen railway. It is often described in the local area as the North Harz Line (Nordharzstrecke)  but the term may cause confusion. The most important, and now the only, intermediate station is Langelsheim.

[[The Hut-Sut Song]]

CATEGORIES: Novelty songs, 1941 songs

"The Hut-Sut Song (a Swedish Serenade)" is a novelty song from the 1940s with nonsense lyrics. The song was written in 1941 by Leo V. Killion, Ted McMichael and Jack Owens. The first and most popular recording was by Horace Heidt and His Musical Knights.
The lyrics state that a Swedish boy skipped school to sit by a stream and sing what is purportedly a Swedish folk song. The chorus goes in part:
The song then purports to define some of the words as relating to a boy and a girl by a river and their dreams. The song has an unusual and contagious rhythm.
The song was also recorded by various artists such as Mel Tormé, Freddy Martin and Spike Jones. The song is of the same genre as other novelty songs of the era, such as "Mairzy Doats" and "Three Little Fishies (Itty Bitty Pool)"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]all three of which were subjected to the musical arrangements of Spike Jones. Some contend that the song was a rewriting of an unpublished Missouri River song called "Hot Shot Dawson".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogerowenspeanutman.com/the%20peanut%20gallery_files/TIME_com%20Hot%20Shot%20and%20Hut-Sut%20--%20Jul%2028,%201941%20--%20Page%201.htm |title=TIME.com: Hot Shot and Hut-Sut[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Jul 28, 1941[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]Page 1 |publisher=Rogerowenspeanutman.com |date=1941-07-28 |accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl]
The popularity of the song is lampooned in a 1940s film short.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/soundie_1 |title=Soundie – The Hut Sut Song : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09[/tpl] In the film, The King's Men (who also performed on Fibber McGee and Molly), play young men living in a boarding house who are endlessly singing the song while getting dressed, eating dinner, playing cards, etc., until the exasperated proprietor finally has them removed to an insane asylum.
The song is featured in the movies From Here to Eternity, Ace in the Hole, and A Christmas Story. In the 1942 animated short from Warner Brothers, Horton Hatches the Egg, the lyrics are further garbled as "Hut sut ra, sat on a willowa, so on, so on, so forth". A snippet of the song was also sung by Rowlf the Dog in a Veterinarians' Hospital sketch on the Muppet Show.
In the UK, an episode of a 1970s sitcom Happy Ever After (a show that evolved into the later sitcom Terry and June), starring Terry Scott and comedy doyen June Whitfield, was built around the song. In the episode "The Hut-Sut-Song" (series 5, episode 2, first aired in September 1978) Terry remembers the Freddy Martin version of the song from his youth. Getting a copy of the record becomes a comedic quest throughout the episode, culminating is his finding an old 78RPM copy of it.

[[Hugh Brock]]

CATEGORIES: 1914 births, 1985 deaths, Pacifism, British pacifists, British conscientious objectors, British anti-war activists

Hugh Brock (1914 - 1985) was a lifelong British pacifist, editor of Peace News between 1955 and 1964, a promoter of nonviolent direct action and a founder of the Direct Action Committee, a forerunner of the Committee of 100.
Hugh Brock was a conscientious objector in World War II. In May 1940, in the face of new defence regulations and demands in parliament for the banning of Peace News, its printer refused to continue printing it and, at the same time, the Wholesale Newsagent Association, which handled two-thirds of the circulation, refused to distribute it any longer. Alternative printing arrangements were made by the editor, Humphrey Moore, and Hugh and his brother, Ashley, (C A Brock) agreed to ignore any potential threat under the regulations and, with peace groups across Britain, created an efficient voluntary distribution chain.Harry Mister “Humphrey Moore 1909-1995” 
Brock took on the role of assistant editor of Peace News in 1946 and became editor in 1955. Brock, shifted the focus of Peace News towards campaigning for nuclear disarmament, non violent direct action and the movement for colonial freedom. In 1955 he hired the American academic Gene Sharp to Peace News to cover the black civil rights movement.http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/archives-of-peace-news/ At that time the newspaper was the official organ of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU) but this formal link was broken in 1961. He left Peace News in 1964.http://www.brad.ac.uk/library/special/cwlhbp.php
Between 1946 and 1952 Peace News published more than 160 articles dedicated to the discussion of Gandhi's relevance to the West.[ref]Sean Scalmer                
”Globalising Gandhi: Translation, Reinvention, Application, Transformation” Borderlands Vol 4 No 3, http://www.borderlands.net.au/issues/vol4no3.html[/ref] During the 1950s Hugh Brock played a significant role in the growth of nonviolent protest in Britain. In November 1949 the PPU had set up a Nonviolence Commission to study nonviolent resistance and the ideas of Gandhi. In December 1951 some members formed 'Operation Gandhi' to organise nonviolent direct action directly inspired by Gandhi. Among their aims were the withdrawal of US troops from Britain and an end to Britain's production of atomic weapons. Brock was secretary of this group. Its activities included a sit-down outside the War Office on 11 January 1952. Eleven protesters squatted in front of the War Office, having first notified the police. The protesters did not resist arrest and pleaded guilty to the charges against them, following principles of nonviolence.Sean Scalmer op cit, quoting Peace News
There were other protests at Aldermaston, Mildenhall, Porton Down and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The protest march to Aldermaston in 1952 involved just 35 people and paved the way for the much larger Aldermaston Marches that began in 1958.Brock, Hugh, "Marching to Aldermaston - ten years ago!", Sanity, Good Friday, 1962
In 1957 Hugh Brock was one of a committee that arranged protests against British testing of the H-bomb on Christmas Island in the Pacific. The committee later became the Direct Action Committee, which organised the 1958 Aldermaston March. With the formation in 1960 of the Committee of 100, which organised civil disobedience against nuclear weapons on a larger scale, the Direct Action Committee merged into the new organisation. 
After leaving Peace News Brock continued to be involved with peace campaigning until his death in 1985. He kept a large number of papers, which were donated to the University of Bradford by his wife Eileen. 
The Hugh Brock Memorial Library, Kitwe Zambia, was established in his memory.Peace News #2434 February 1999

John Skylitzes reports Irene was a "beautiful captive from Larissa" and nothing else is know about her antecedents. Gavril Radomir married her around 999 after he had expelled his first Hungarian wife, who was pregnant at this time.
They had seven children, five sons and two daughters.
Gavril Radomir succeeded to the Bulgarian throne in 1014 but his reign was short. Skylitzes reports that Irene was murdered along with her husband by his cousin, Ivan Vladislav, who seized the throne in 1015. He also took steps to ensure his position and ordered the mutilation of their eldest son.

[[Berlekamp–Zassenhaus algorithm]]
CATEGORIES: Computer algebra

In mathematics, in particular in computational algebra, the Berlekamp–Zassenhaus algorithm is an algorithm for factoring polynomials over the integers, named after Elwyn Berlekamp and Hans Zassenhaus. As a consequence of Gauss's lemma, this amounts to solving the problem also over the rationals.
The algorithm starts by finding factorizations over suitable finite fields using Hensel's lemma to lift the solution from modulo a prime p to a convenient power of p. After this the right factors are found as a subset of these. 
The worst case of this algorithm is exponential in the number of factors.
[tpl]harvtxt|van Hoeij|2002[/tpl] improved this algorithm by using the LLL algorithm, substantially reducing the time needed to choose the right subsets of mod p factors.

Timothy Parsons writes: '..military authorities in Kenya took 1964 mutinies in Taganyika and Uganda very seriously and quickly developed plans to deal with a similar incident in their country. .. As a result General Ian Freeland had considerably more resources at his disposal to prevent and contain potential problems in the Kenyan soldiery. Once Lieutenant Colonel Mans gave East Africa Command a careful account of how trouble had broken out in the Tanganyika Rifles, Freeland ordered the Kenyan Special Branch to step up its surveillance of key army units.'Timothy Parsons, 'The 1964 Army Mutinies and the Making of Modern East Africa, 2003, 118. This did not prevent trouble breaking out on 24 January 1964 in the lines of 11th Kenya Rifles at Lanet Barracks near Nakuru. However, the problem was quickly contained, courts-martial ordered, and the unit was eventually disbanded.

There are several convention centres in the Netherlands. Traditionally there is a distinction in the Netherlands between convention centres for meetings and those for exhibitions/trade shows. Over the past decades this distinction has become blurred, as exhibition facilities have added meeting rooms and meeting centred venues have opened exhibition halls. Also, most of the bigger hotels have built meeting rooms, some of them for large scale (international) gatherings.

[[Ford D-series]]

CATEGORIES: Ford trucks

The Ford D-Series  was a range of middle weight trucks introduced by Ford of Britain in 1965.[tpl]cite journal| journal = Autocar |volume = 128 (nbr 3766) | authorlink = Maurice A Smith (Ed)|title =Ford Heavy vehicles|pages =  105| date = 18 April 1968[/tpl]  It replaced the Thames Trader and appears to have been envisaged as a more modern competitor to the Bedford TK produced by General Motors' UK truck subsidiary.   
In 1965 the range covered rigid trucks with gross weights from 5.2 to 12.75 British tons, and tippers from 10.8 to 12.75 tons.   Higher gross weights became available with the subsequent introduction of versions featuring twin rear axles and articulated models were also quickly added to the range.
Three new diesel engines were developed for the trucks, respectively of 3.97 litres, 5.42 litres and 5.95 litres cylinder capacity.   The smallest unit was of four cylinders while the larger engines employed six cylinders.   Claimed power ranged from 82.5 bhp to 128 bhp.   Possibly with an eye to export markets outside Europe, petrol-engined versions with power outputs of 129 bhp and 149 bhp were also offered.
As on the Bedford TK and on various US built heavy trucks of the time, the cabin was a flat fronted forward control unit positioned above the engine.   Engine access was achieved by tilting the entire cab forwards:  the hinge at the front employed a torsion-bar counterbalancing system which according to commentators made tilting the cab to access the engine "almost a one-hand job".   The engines were installed at an angle of 45 degrees from the vertical which was intended to enable the cab interior to feature a virtually flat floor without the cab itself becoming excessively tall.
April 1967 saw the range expanded upwards with the arrival of the Phase II D1000 series, designed for operation up to a weight of 28 tons gross, and at that time the largest trucks ever produced by Ford of Britain.   The D1000s were powered by Cummins produced V8 diesel engines of 7.7 litres displacement.
In 1981 the range was replaced by the Ford Cargo in European markets and by the Ford N-Series (badge-engineered Hino Ranger) in Australasia.

The Flammenmergel is a lithological unit of the Lower Chalk in Germany.
In Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) it reaches a depth of 110 to 150 m in the area of the Sackmulde (a fold in the Germanic Basin).Harms, F. J. (1984): Erläuterungen zu Blatt Nr. 4025 Freden. Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Bodenforschung, 168 S., Hannover. The Flammenmergel gets its name from its "flamed" or "burnt" appearance.
According to JORDAN(1968), this appearance is caused by the tracks of burrowing organisms, which consist primarily of siliceous sponge spicules which have been washed into the burrows.Jordan, H. (1968): Gliederung und Genese des Flammenmergels (Alb) in Hils- und Sackmulde. Z. dt. Geol. Ges., 117: 391-424, Hannover. The silicic acid, when weathered, forms black streaks, which give the rock its characteristic appearance. Jordan divides the Flammenmergel into five units. The Flammenmergel is a slightly clayey to slightly sandy marl. It is yellow to ochre in colour, whereas the streaky "flames" are dark grey to black. The rock is siliceous and hard.

CATEGORIES: 1920 books, Sustainability books, Birth control

Woman and the New Race is a book by birth control advocate Margaret Sanger published in 1920. It advocates contraception as the only reasonable means to prevent overpopulation. The book discusses Dr. Thomas Robert Malthus's advocacy of celibacy until middle age to avoid overpopulation, but criticizes the idea as harmful, and also suggests that karezza, also called coitus reservatus, is harmful. She states in the book that a few men and women can channel their sexual impulses into a non-sexual direction, but that this will not work for most people, and that those people need sex and if celibate will be harm physically and mentally by their celibacy and therefore should be able to use birth control.

CATEGORIES: Lists of political office-holders in the United States, History of libertarianism

Third-party officeholders in the United States are rare at any point of time. Although the current two-party system in the U.S., with the Republican party and Democratic party, started in 1856, many of the older parties still existed and had an influence. Therefore, this article includes any politician since the end of Reconstruction or since the 45th United States Congress.
These galleries and lists include anyone who at one time, while in office, was an independent or affiliated with a third party. They are listed in descending order from the first year they were in office as something other than a Republican or Democrat.
Since the end of Reconstruction, there have been a total of 30 U.S. Senators, 111 U.S. Representatives, and 28 Governors that weren't affiliated with a major party. Currently, there are two U.S. Senators (King and Sanders), and four major city Mayors.  Hundreds of third-party officeholders exist at the local level (including those in nonpartisan positions who are affiliated with a third-party), including 146 Libertarian Party members[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/candidates/elected-officials|title=Elected Officials – Libertarian Party|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 October 2013[/tpl] and

A Man Called Sarge is a 1990 American parody film, written and directed by Stuart Gillard, starring Gary Kroeger, Marc Singer, Gretchen German and introducing a young Natasha Lyonne. Set during the World War II North African Western Desert Campaign, it follows a misadventurous squad of French Foreign Legion deserters, led by their charismatic Sarge, who set out across the Sahara desert to strike a blow on the Nazi-occupied city of Tobruk.
The humour is built on slapstick and verbal puns, in the fashion of comedy filmmaking trio Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker, spoofing a variety of classic war movies – notably Casablanca[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100100/movieconnections|title=A Man Called Sarge|work=Movie connections|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2010-06-18[/tpl] – and the stereotypes of the genre. Sarge (Gary Kroeger), the anti-hero protagonist, is a patriot with an over-the-top John Wayne persona. The antagonist, General Von Kraut (Marc Singer), is a derogatory portrayal of a Nazi commander – extremely evil, perverted and a poor decision maker – emphasized by his name, as kraut is often used as a pejorative term for German soldiers. Furthermore, Sarge's group of misfit soldiers include a Native American, a New York Jew, a hillbilly and a French officer in the style of Maurice Chevalier.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.movieguide.org/archive/32/7381/&Itemid=44|title=A Man Called Sarge|work=Christian Movie Review|publisher=Movieguide|accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]

[[Molly Springfield]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, 1977 births, American conceptual artists, University of California, Berkeley alumni

Molly Springfield (born 1977) is an American artist whose work includes labor-intensive drawings of printed texts and visual explorations of the history of information technology.Huan Hsu, Text Messaging: Molly Springfield, Washington City Paper, Mar. 24, 2006.  Springfield's art practice is unusual in that it combines meticulous, observational drawing with conceptual and historical investigations.  Her drawings and installations are typically based on texts that reveal visionary moments in the history of how people experience, organize, and reproduce information. She is best known for delicate, faithful graphite-on-paper drawings of photocopied books.
Springfield's "Marginalia Archive" is an interactive installation that explores the relationships readers have with text. Her source material, contemporary examples of marginalia submitted by friends and viewers, is repurposed into a functioning archive that expands during the course of an exhibition. According to one art critic, the project "extends her practice of drawing printed and handwritten text, and adds a social dimension" that "chimes with today's social media consciousness and with growing concern over what, in the way of participatory engagement, we will lose if the age of the book actually does come to an end."Kenneth Baker, Molly Springfield's marginalia at Steven Wolf, San Francisco Chronicle, Feb. 1, 2013.
Springfield has completed what she called a "translation" of the first chapter of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, consisting entirely of drawings of photocopies of every existing English translation of the novel.New "Translation" of Proust, Baltimore Sun, June 27, 2009.  Critic Kenneth Baker, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, called it an “irresistible” work “of rare conceptual elegance."Kenneth Baker, Proust in 'Translation' at Wolf, San Francisco Chronicle, Feb. 28, 2009. In 2009, the project was exhibited at Steven Wolf Fine Arts in San Francisco, where it was nominated  for an AICA (International Association of Art Critics) Award for "Best Show in a Commercial Gallery Nationally,"; at Thomas Robertello Gallery in Chicago, where it was listed as one of the top 5 drawing shows of the year by Newcity Magazine; and the Baltimore Museum of Art, where it was nominated  for the Janet and Walter Sondheim Prize. In 2013, the project was included in the survey exhibition "Graphite" at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.Sarah Urist Green, Graphite, The Indianapolis Museum of Art, 2013.
Springfield's previous work includes a major series of graphite drawings of photocopies of books concerning seminal moments in the history of conceptual art of the late 1960s and early 1970s—a series that was exhibited at The Drawing Center in New York in 2013-2014.Amoreen Armetta, Molly Springfield, ARTFORUM, Jan. 2009. In a November 2013 review of the project in the New York Times, critic Ken Johnson wrote: "What is an object, anyway? Must it be something material? Can a concept be an object? Are words and poems objects? What about sounds, actions and events? If an object exists only in a photograph, is it still an object? Do imaginary objects count? If you allow that a question can be an object, then such queries could be the primary objects of Ms. Springfield’s beautifully realized, brain-teasing drawings." Ken Johnson, When How It Looks Matters More Than What It Says, New York Times, Nov. 21, 2013.
Another previous installation by Springfield, exhibited in 2006, was based on the life and writings of William Henry Fox Talbot, the polymath who invented negative-positive photography.  The installation—a mix of conceptual drawing, experimental photography, and historical homage—included graphite drawings of photocopied pages from the introduction to The Pencil of Nature, secondary sources discussing Talbot's photographic discoveries, and the results of Springfield's own experiments with calotype photography using cutouts from Talbot's scientific notebooks.
Springfield's work is in several public and private collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Sally & Wynn Kramarsky Collection. Her work has been included in exhibitions at the American University Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University, The Contemporary Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Portland Museum of Art, University of Richmond Museums, and the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, and one-person exhibitions at galleries in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington. Reviews of her work have appeared in Artforum, Art Papers, Modern Painters, The Village Voice, The New Yorker, The San Francisco Chronicle, and The Chicago Tribune. Springfield received her MFA from the University of California at Berkeley and was a participant at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2006. She has taught art at various institutions, including Berkeley, the Maryland Institute College of Art, American University, and George Washington University.

[[Karamojong language]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of Uganda, Karamojong language

The Karamojong language (spelled ŋaKarimojoŋ or ŋaKaramojoŋ in Karamojong; Ngakarimojong or N'Karamojong in English) is a Nilo-Saharan language spoken mainly in the Karamoja subregion of north-eastern Uganda.
Ngakarimojong is a Nilotic language of the Nilo-Saharan language family (Encyclopædia Britannica) spoken by at least 370,000 people in Uganda – the Karamojong people, or ŋiKarimojoŋ in their language.  The name approximates to "the old men sat down", dating from a time of migration 300 or more years ago when this group refused to travel further on (to what is now Teso).  They are a cattle-keeping people practising transhumance, which is reflected in the language as are their traditional religious beliefs. Settled cultivation is relatively recent and thus words associated with this are usually borrowed from neighbouring languages or from languages introduced by, or as a result of, colonialism – English, Luganda, Swahili.  Modern technical words come from these latter also.
Closely related languages and dialects are spoken by many more peoples, including the Jie, Dodoth, Teso (in Uganda), Turkana, Tesyo (in Kenya), Jiye, Toposa in South Sudan (?), and also by at least one tribe in Ethiopia, the Nyangatom.[tpl]cite book|last=Lamphear|first=John|title=The traditional history of the Jie of Uganda|year=1976|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford[/tpl] Jie and Dodoth (Dodos) are counted as dialects by Ethnologue 16, but as separate languages by Blench (2012).
These peoples are part of the Karamojong cluster of Nilotic tribes, which is also called the Teso cluster.

Ludwig Ernst Hans Burmester (5 May 1840 – 20 April 1927) was a German kinematician and geometer.
His doctoral thesis Über die Elemente einer Theorie der Isophoten (About the elements of a theory of isophotes) concerned lines on a surface defined by light direction. After a period as a teacher in Lodz he became professor of synthetic geometry at Dresden where his growing interest in kinematics culminated in his Lehrbuch der Kinematik, Erster Band, Die ebene Bewegung (Textbook of Kinematics, First Volume, Planar Motion) of 1888, developing the approach to the theory of linkages introduced by Franz Reuleaux, whereby a planar mechanism was understood as a collection of Euclidean planes in relative motion with one degree of freedom. Burmester considered both the theory of planar kinematics and practically all actual mechanisms known in his time. In doing so, Burmester developed Burmester theory which applies projective geometry to the loci of points on planes moving in straight lines and in circles, where any motion may be understood in relation to four Burmester points.Ceccarelli and Koetsier, Burmester and Allevi: A Theory and its Application for Mechanism Design at the end of 19th Century, Proceedings of IDETC/CIE 2006 ASME 2006 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference http://webuser.unicas.it/weblarm/file%20pdf/327-burmester&allieviDETC2006-99165.pdf
The Burmester linkage of 1888 is a four bar linkage part of whose coupler curve is an approximately straight line (see also Watt's linkage).
A French curve may also be known as a Burmester curve.

[[Herbie (tree)]]

CATEGORIES: Individual elm trees, Cumberland County, Maine, Yarmouth, Maine, 2010s individual tree deaths

"Herbie" was an American elm tree located in  Yarmouth, Maine, USA. It stood by present-day East Main Street (State Route 88), at its intersection with Yankee Drive,"Will elm trees make their way back?" - St. Joseph's College Magazine between 1793 and January 19 2010. At 110 feet in height, it was, between 1997 and the date of its felling,According to the plaque on its trunk. the oldestImages of America: Yarmouth, Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002) and largest"Yarmouth braces for Herbie's demise" - Portland Press Herald, August 10 2009 of its kind in New England.The National Register of Big Trees: 2000-01 The tree, which partially stood in the front yard of a private residence, also had a 20-foot circumference and (until mid-2008) a 93-foot crown spread. It was so-named when children witnessed some of its diseased limbs being sawn off. "What are you going to do to Herbie? Don't cut Herbie!" they cried, and the name stuck."The Old Man and the Tree" - NYTimes.com, January 8 2010
A plaque on its trunk stated:

On May 1 1834, the town gave Herbie some company by planting rows of elm trees along East Elm Street. From 1957 onward, however, most of them succumbed to Dutch elm disease. As of 2003, only twenty of Yarmouth's original 739 elms had survived."Champion of Trees" - American Profile
After battling fifteen bouts of Dutch elm disease, in 2007 stripes appeared under the tree's bark, indicating a worsening condition. In August 2009 it was revealed that Herbie would be cut down on January 18 and 19 2010,"The Herbie Project" - Town of Yarmouth's website at a cost of $20,000."When this tree falls, he will feel it" - Boston.com, December 27 2009 In October 2009, the plaque was removed from its trunk and replaced with a laminated version, and before the end of the year, "The Herbie Project" fund-raising campaign was set up to raise money to care for and plant other trees in the town. After the tree's demise, local woodworkers used its wood to make products which will be auctioned off to raise money for the trust.
A snowstorm during the night of January 17 and 18 2010 postponed the removal. The tree was removed on January 19, just before noon. A preliminary count of the tree's rings, done on site, revealed its age to be at least 212 years."Farewell to Herbie and a 'beautiful relationship'" - Portland Press Herald, January 19 2010 On February 4, however, the official count showed it to be 217. 
The stump itself was removed over the weekend of May 29 and 30. A section of the trunk's base was on show at the 2010 Yarmouth Clam Festival. It is now on permanent display outside Yarmouth's town hall, on Cleaves Street, a project of the local Eagle Scouts.
Frank Knight, the town's former "tree warden", died at the age of 103 on May 14 2012. Knight's casket was made, in secret, out of Herbie's wood.[tpl]cite news|title=Frank Knight Dead: 'Herbie' The Elm Tree Caretaker Dies At 103|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/14/frank-knight-dead-age-103_n_1515496.html?ref=topbar|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=15 May 2012|date=May 14, 2012[/tpl] Succeeded by Deb Hopkins in 2006, Knight cared for the tree for half of his life, having accepted the role in 1956.

[[Service chain optimization]]
CATEGORIES: Business software

Service Chain Optimization is the application of processes and tools that embrace all functions for improving the efficiency, productivity and, eventually, the profitability of service organizations.
In this regard, profitability of a service organization is measured by the revenue generated from service demand (in the form of service work orders being carried out), and by the costs due to activity of the enterprise's human resources (who provide the service). Service chains consider the full life-cycle of service demand from early stages of forecasting, through planning, scheduling, dispatch, execution and post-analysis.
Service Chain Optimization is closely related to the fields of Workforce Management and Field Service Management; the activity performed by field service resources is managed through the later while being planned and optimized through the former. This relationship is analogous to the relation between supply chain optimization and Supply Chain Management in the domain of manufacturing. In this regard, the service chain benefits from demand forecasting, resource planning and scheduling, and long term analysis activities similarly to the manner these contribute in the supply chain (being typically managed by ERP systems and optimized by supply chain optimization systems).

The party was founded in 1919. At the party congress in September 1922 the party adopted a party programme which acknowledged the inclusion of Carpathian Ruthenia as an autonomous region in the Czechoslovak Republic.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 – 1940. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d.

Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002. p. 468 
The main difference between the party and the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers Party (ČSDSD) was that ČSDSD supported the government in Prague, whilst the Subcarpathian party opposed it as the government did not support the formation of an autonomous region of all Rusyn-inhabited areas.

Tiffany Foundation in Oyster Bay, Long Island.Lowrey, p. 193 After frequent visits to Monhegan Island off the Maine coast starting in the late 1920s, he and his wife, the artist Mary Taylor (1895–1970), settled there by 1940. He fished with the lobstermen and "painted Monhegan in all seasons, frequently rowing around the island in the worst of weather to capture scenes of the harshest seas and the most dramatic views of the cliffs and rocks."Chambers, pp.13-14 
Winter was attracted to Monhegan's rocky coast, architecture, and the dramatic force of the ocean. The geometric strength, clear lighting, and absence of human presence in his landscapes have invited comparison to the work of his contemporary, Edward Hopper. 
Winter exhibited his paintings and won prizes at the National Academy, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Salmagundi Club, and during his lifetime he also exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art  in Washington, D.C., the Currier Gallery of Art in Manchester, New Hampshire, and the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York. His work was included in an exhibition devoted to the work of foreign-born American artists at the 1939 New York World's Fair. 
Winter's scrapbooks are in the collection of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.Smithsonian Archives

[[Nittel Nacht]]
CATEGORIES: Christmas-linked holidays, December observances, Christianity and Judaism

Nittel Nacht[ref]Yiddish, Leil Hannital in Hebrew. See 
[/ref] is a name given to Christmas Eve by Jewish scholars in the 17th century, although Rabbi Samuel Eidels already observed the day by the late 16th century. In the Middle Ages (in Christendom), Jews were forbidden from appearing in public during the high Christmas holidays, and as such the day marked the beginning of a siege of sorts for certain Jewish populations. Jewish mystics believed apostates were conceived on the day and as a result Rabbis forbade married couples from sex on Nittel Nacht. Studying the Torah was also forbidden, although some read the Toledot Yeshu instead. Passing the time playing card games or chess was also popular.
After the advent of the Gregorian Calendar, Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians observed Christmas Eve on two separate dates; this led to Rabbinic debate, and Nittel Nacht is observed in accordance with the local Christian community. Certain pious Jews observed Nittel Nacht twice each year. 
In modern times, with less tense Judeo-Christian relations, Nittel Nacht is less observed, although certain Orthodox denominations still observe it.

Pedro Lombardía (Córdoba, 1930-Pamplona, 1986) was a Spanish canonist and pioneer of the Study of State Ecclesiastical Law in Spain. He held the chairs of Canon Law and State Ecclesiastical Law at the University of Navarra and the Complutense University of Madrid.
Lombardía was the founder of the School of Lombardía, a group of canonists  who advocated for a methodological modernization of canon law. Lombardía and his followers shared an interest of overcoming the exegetical method to  and replace by the systematic approach with  the Italian School of Canon Law but disagree with  their  theory of canonizatio according to which the ultimate criteria of unity of the canonic order is  in the acts of the ecclesiastical authority. For the school of Lombardía the theory of canonizatio necessarily implies the acceptance of legal positivism and the conditioning of the binding character of the divine law (natural and positive) to an act of authority.
Another central concern in the work of Lombardía is the need to complement the traditional view of canon law as a discipline with a perspective based on the freedoms and rights of members of the Catholic Church. This concern lead him to develop a theory of the fundamental rights of the members of the church,  which is one of the influences of the second title of the current Code of Canon Law.
In his later years Lombardía was especially devoted himself to the study of State Ecclesiastical Law.

[[1957 Pacific hurricane season]]

CATEGORIES: Pacific hurricane seasons, 1957 Pacific hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1957 Pacific hurricane season was a moderately active year in which 13 tropical cyclones formed. The hurricane season ran through the summer and fall months which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on July 15. The final storm dissipated on December 6, becoming one of the few Pacific storms to exist outside of the seasonal dates. Of the season's 13 storms, five of these formed or crossed into the central Pacific.
During the season, five storms impacted land. Hurricane Twelve was the deadliest, leaving eight casualties in Mazatlán and the costliest was Hurricane Nina, causing an estimated $100,000 in losses. In addition to the damage, four people were killed by Nina in Hawaii. Hurricane Six killed seven people and Hurricane Ten killed two in Mexico.

Görög Katolikus Szemle ('Greek Catholic Survey') was a Hungarian-language Greek Catholic weekly newspaper published from Ungvár, Subcarpathian Rus, between 1899-1918. Görög Katolikus Szemle was the organ of the Society of Saint Basil the Great 1899-1901, and by the Unio Book Publishing Company 1902-1918.Magocsi, Paul R., and I. I. Pop. Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002. p. 142
Viktor Kaminsky was the editor of the newspaper for most of its existence.
Politically, the newspaper represented a sector of the Greek Catholic clergy. The group behind Görög Katolikus Szemle supported the Habsburg monarchy, but opposed Hungarian assimilation of the Rusyn people. The group symbolically supported use of Church Slavonic and Cyrillic script.
Görög Katolikus Szemle was closed down in December 1918, after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire. In 1919 Kárpát was launched as a continuation, but that publication did not last beyond that year.

Anderson Street Station is a New Jersey Transit rail station on the Pascack Valley Line. The station is one of two rail stations in Hackensack, New Jersey, United States, and is located at Anderson Street near Linden Street. The Essex Street station is also located in Hackensack. This line runs to Hoboken Terminal with connections via the Secaucus Junction transfer station to New Jersey Transit one-stop service to New York Penn Station and to other NJ Transit rail service. All normal schedule trains service this station seven days a week, except for the Metro-North Railroad Express trains to Spring Valley, New York. 
The station house was built in 1869 (and opened on September 9, 1869) by the Hackensack and New York Railroad on a track extension from Passaic Street in Hackensack. The station was turned over to the Erie Railroad in 1896 and New Jersey Transit in 1983. The next year, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The station building, which was 139 years old, was destroyed in a three-alarm fire and explosion at 5:55 a.m. on January 10, 2009. At the time the station house was the second-oldest (active service) in New Jersey (second to Ramsey's Main Street station). The station building was also the site for the Green Caboose Thrift Shop, a charity gift shop maintained by a branch of the Hackensack University Medical Center from 1962 until the station depot burned in 2009.

[[List of third party performances in United States elections]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of elections in the United States

In the United States, it is rare for a third party (or independent) candidate to perform well in a U.S. election, and rare for one to actually win the election. Below are any elections where a candidate that wasn't a Republican or Democrat obtained at least 5.0% of the vote.
Since 1990, candidates in 32 (8%) of the 380 Senate elections have met this criterion, and two (0.5%) have won, both in 2006. In six of the 32 races, one or the other of the major parties failed to nominate any candidate, allowing third-party candidates to perform better than usual.
In the 302 gubernatorial elections since 1990 the criterion has been met 49 times (16%) and six candidates have won (2%). Until Lincoln Chafee's victory in 2010, no third-party or independent governor had been elected since the 1990s. In the 38 presidential elections since 1856, the criterion has been met in eleven (29%) elections, with no third-party or independent candidate being elected president.

Senegambia, also known in Dutch as Bovenkust ("Upper Coast"), was the collective noun for the fortifications and trading posts owned by the Dutch West India Company (DWIC) in the region now known as Senegal. The main purpose of these trading posts was to obtain slaves in order to ship them to the American continent. The government of the territory was based on Gorée. In 1677, the Dutch lost this island to France. The next year, the French also conquered all DWIC trading posts on the Senegalese coast as well as the island of Arguin.
Having lost almost all the trade in gum arabic, bezoar stone, ambergris and ostrich feathers, the DWIC wanted to regain its position. The Frenchman Jean du Casse, head of the Compagnie de Sénégal, reached an agreement with the local leaders, who decided to destroy the Dutch trading posts and the DWIC lost its position for good.

[[Kitchin cycle]]
CATEGORIES: Economic theories, Theories of history, Sociocultural evolution, Business cycle

Kitchin cycle is a short business cycle of about 40 months discovered in the 1920s by Joseph Kitchin.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kitchin |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1923 |month= |title=Cycles and Trends in Economic Factors |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–16  |jstor=1927031 |doi=10.2307/1927031[/tpl] 
This cycle is believed to be accounted for by time lags in information movements affecting the decision making of commercial firms. Firms react to the improvement of commercial situation through the increase in output through the full employment of the extent fixed capital assets. As a result, within a certain period of time (ranging between a few months and two years) the market gets ‘flooded’ with commodities whose quantity becomes gradually excessive. The demand declines, prices drop, the produced commodities get accumulated in inventories, which informs entrepreneurs of the necessity to reduce output. However, this process takes some time. It takes some time for the information that supply significantly exceeds demand to get to the businesspeople. As it takes entrepreneurs  time to check this information and to make the decision to reduce production, time is also necessary to materialize this decision (these are the time lags that generate the Kitchin cycles). Another relevant time lag is the lag between the materialization of the afore mentioned decision (causing the capital assets to work well below the level of their full employment) and the decrease of the excessive amounts of commodities accumulated in inventories. Yet, after this decrease takes place one can observe the conditions for a new phase of growth of demand, prices, output, etc.See, e.g. Korotayev, Andrey V., & Tsirel, Sergey V.

The Panama held a general election on 7 June 1936, electing both a new President of the Republic and a new National Assembly.
"Instead of supporting the candidate of his own Liberal Doctrinaire Party (Domingo Díaz Arosemena), the President Harmodio Arias Madrid supported Juan Demóstenes Arosemena Barreati, his minister of foreign relations. Arosemena continued to function as part of the administration throughout his campaign. With President Harmodio Arias as his political patron, Arosemena stuck to his controversial (and unconstitutional) candidacy. On election day, the administration distributed duplicate ‘cédulas’ (voter registration cards), destroyed ballot boxes, detained opposing members of the electoral board, and concocted ‘el paquetazo de Veraguas’. The result was a high voter turnout that exceeded all predictions – and possibilities – and brought Arosemena to the presidency despite his constitutional ineligibility."

The Social Democratic Party of the Free City of Danzig ([tpl]lang-de|Sozialdemokratische Partei der Freien Stadt Danzig[/tpl]) was a political party in the Free City of Danzig. After the creation of the Free City of Danzig in 1919, the Danzig branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) separated itself from the party, and created the Social Democratic Party of the Free City of Danzig. The new party did however maintain close links with the SPD, and its political orientation (for example its anti-Soviet/anti-communist approach) was largely the same as that of the SPD.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. pp. 291-292
The party participated in coalition government together with bourgeois parties between August 1925 and October 1926, and again between January 1928 and August 1930.

End of paragraph.[]

[[Hovertrain]]

CATEGORIES: High-speed trains, Hovercraft, Hovertrains, Emerging technologies

A hovertrain is a type of high-speed train that replaces conventional steel wheels with hovercraft lift pads, and the conventional railway bed with a paved road-like surface, known as the "track" or "guideway". The concept aims to eliminate rolling resistance and allow very high performance, while also simplifying the infrastructure needed to lay new lines.
Hovertrains were seen as a relatively low-risk and low-cost way to develop high-speed inter-city train service, in an era when conventional rail seemed stuck to speeds around [tpl]convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] or less. By the late 1960s, major development efforts were underway in France, the UK and the USA. While they were being developed, British Rail was running an extensive study of the problems being seen at high speeds on conventional rails. This led to a series of new high-speed train designs in the 1970s, starting with their own APT. Although the hovertrains still had reduced infrastructure costs compared to the APT and similar designs like the TGV, in practice this was offset by the fact that they needed entirely new lines. Conventional wheeled trains could run at low speed on existing lines, greatly reducing capital expenditures in dense areas. Interest in hovertrains waned, and major development had ended by the mid-1970s.
Hovertrains were also developed for smaller systems, including personal rapid transit systems that were a hot topic in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this role their ability to float over small imperfections and debris on the "rails" was a practical advantage, although it competed with the maglev concept that had the same advantages. The only hovertain to see commercial service was the Otis Hovair system. Originally developed at General Motors as an automated guideway transit system, GM was forced to divest the design as part of an anti-trust ruling. The design eventually ended up at Otis Elevator who later replaced its linear motor with a cable pull and sold the resulting design for people mover installations all over the world.
Hovertrain is a generic term, and the vehicles are more commonly referred to by the projects that developed them in different countries – in the UK they are known as tracked hovercraft, in the US they are tracked air-cushion vehicles, and in France they are the aerotrains. News sources often conflate maglev trains with hovertrains, as both are levitated above the running surface, "hovering" over them.

Hurricane How was the only tropical cyclone to make landfall on the United States in 1951. It was the eighth storm of the season, forming on September 28 in the northwest Caribbean and, after entering the Gulf of Mexico, turned eastward and became a tropical storm. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Florida, causing flooding and $2 million in damage. Tropical Storm How later became a hurricane, passing near the Outer Banks of North Carolina where it produced strong winds and high tides. A ship called the "Southern Isles" capsized off of Cape Hatteras, killing 17 out of the crew of 23. Rains and high tides occurred in southeastern New England, before the hurricane moved out to sea and became extratropical.

[[Symphony No. 2 (Hanson)]]
CATEGORIES: Compositions by Howard Hanson, 20th-century symphonies, 1930 compositions

The Symphony No. 2 in D-flat major, Opus 30, W45,p. 49 (1993) Perone "Romantic", was written by Howard Hanson on commission from Serge Koussevitsky for the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1930,p. 24 (2004) Cohen and published by Carl Fischer Music.
The symphony, written for a standard orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, cymbals, harp and strings, was premiered by Koussevitzky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra on November 28, 1930. Soon after Arturo Toscanini played it with the New York Philharmonic.p. 407 (1993) Canarina Hanson himself has conducted and recorded the work with the Eastman-Rochester Symphony Orchestra. Other conductors include Erich Kunzel, Sir Neville Marriner, Gerard Schwarz, Leonard Slatkin, but most performances today are by youth and amateur orchestras.p. 406 (1993) Canarina "The Second Symphony by Howard Hanson, the Third by Robert Ward and the Third of Roy Harris are within the capabilities of our American community orchestras."p. 74, Van Horn (1979) James. Westport, Connecticut The Community Orchestra: A Handbook for Conductors, Managers and Boards Greenwood Press
The symphony is in three movements, with much thematic material shared among the movements.
The "lyrical, haunting second theme" of the first movement has become known as the "Interlochen theme"p. 24 (2004) Cohen (as it is performed at the conclusion of all concerts at the Interlochen Center for the Arts).It reappears "with greater emphasis" in the following two movements.p. 407 (1993) Canarina The slow movement was arranged for concert band by Norman Goldberg and in this form was also published by Carl Fischer.p. 49 (1993) Perone
Hanson considered himself a "perfect fifth composer" or a "major third composer," but in this symphony, it is the perfect fourth "that plays a prominent part throughout the symphony in both melody and harmony."p. 141 (2004) Cohen Despite the abundance of triplets, the Bruckner rhythm occurs only in a few spots, mainly in the horns' and trumpets' parts; the others are in the timpani in the first movement,Measure 10, p. 2 (1930) Hanson and at the end of a longer rhythmical motif in the finale.Letter G, p. 103 forward (1930) Hanson
While Hanson is deemed to have broken new ground in the symphony, he "produced a popular concert work which is the epitome of the twentieth-century symphony that could have been written by an American."p. 140 (1998) Butterworth Virgil Thomson, a contemporary of Hanson's opined of Hanson's music in general that "I have never yet found in any work of his a single phrase or turn of harmony that did not sound familiar," and of the symphony specifically "it is as standardized in expression as it is eclectic in style. Not a surprise from beginning to end, nor any adventure."p. 179 (1998) Steinberg
Hanson was displeased that the theme was used for the closing credits of Alien[tpl]cite book|last = McIntee|first = David|authorlink = David A. McIntee|title = Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorized Guide to the Alien and Predator Films|publisher = Telos Publishing Ltd.|year = 2005|location = Surrey, England|page = 38|isbn = 1-903889-94-4[/tpl] without his permission, but decided not to fight it in court.pp. 24 - 25 (2004) Cohen More positively, John Williams used the symphony as a model for his music for E. T.p. 6 (1994) Karlin
Hanson himself conducted the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra in a 1958 stereo recording of the symphony for Mercury Records, which was later reissued on CD and has remained in catalogues for many years.
The symphony had the distinction of being one of the very few American works that Arturo Toscanini conducted when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; however, Toscanini did not record the music, even during the many years he led the NBC Symphony Orchestra.

[[Thomas of Marlborough]]

CATEGORIES: Abbots of Evesham, 1236 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Thomas of Marlborough (died 1236) (sometimes Thomas de Marleberge)Knowles Monastic Order p. 333 was a medieval English monk and writer. He became abbot of Evesham Abbey in 1230.
Thomas studied civil and canon law at Paris where he studied under Stephen Langton, later Archbishop of Canterbury. He made friends with Richard Poore, later Bishop of Chichester, Salisbury and Durham, while a student. After finishing his studies, Thomas taught at Oxford University before becoming a monk around 1199 at Evesham.Knowles Monastic Order p. 335 While at Oxford, he also studied with John of Tynemouth, a canon lawyer and later Archdeacon of Oxford.Boyle "Beginnings of Legal Studies" Viator pp. 110-111
Thomas was the author of a history of the abbots and abbey of Evesham, entitled the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. Thomas' main purpose in writing the Chronicon was to show that Evesham was exempt from the supervision of the Bishops of Worcester. In writing his work, Thomas incorporated an earlier work on the history of the abbey.Gransden Historical Writing pp. 111–112 This earlier work was probably composed by Dominic of Evesham, a monk at Evesham around 1125.Knowles Monastic Order pp. 704–705 Most of the evidence for Thomas' incorporation of an earlier work is stylistic, but it appears likely that Thomas reworked it in order to strengthen his argument.
Thomas needed evidence to help Evesham's legal case due to the conflict between the abbey and Mauger, the Bishop of Worcester, which began when Mauger attempted to visit and inspect the abbey in 1201.Gransden Historical Writing p. 519 Thomas was one of the leading defenders of the rights of the abbey, in what was to turn into a long drawn out legal case before the king and then the papacy. Although it was suspended with the exile of Mauger during the Interdict on England in King John's reign, it was later revived, and finally decided in 1248. However, the case against the bishop became entangled with a dispute within the abbey between the monks and the abbot Roger Norreis over the payment of the costs of the legal fight with Mauger, which eventually resulted in the expulsion of Norreis in 1213.Knowles Monastic Order pp. 335–342
Thomas was previously the prior of Evesham before being elected by the monks in 1229. However, his election was not considered valid until he was admitted to the office by the pope, which occurred before he was blessed in the office around 11 July 1230. He was enthroned as abbot on 29 September 1230.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 41
After Thomas had petitioned the papacy for permission to resign the abbacy on the grounds of  old age and physical disability, the pope gave permission to the Bishop of Coventry to allow his resignation on 13 July 1236.  Thomas died on 12 September 1236.

Shi Yi Ji ([tpl]zh|c=拾遺記|p=Shíyí Jì[/tpl]) is a Chinese mythological / historical treatise compiled by the  Taoist scholar Wang Jia (died 390). The title of the work has been variously translated into English as Record of Heretofore Lost Works,Empresses and consorts: selections from Chen Shou's Records of the Three ...  Researches into Lost Records,
Record of Gleanings,Alexander Wylie, Chinese researches 
or Forgotten Tales.
The verb shiyi (拾遺) is translated by modern dictionaries as "to appropriate lost property", or, when used in book titles, "to make up for omissions". Accordingly, the  work is based on "apocryphal" versions of early (legendary) Chinese history, which must have been produced during the Eastern Han Dynasty. For example, Shi Yi Jis version of the story of Yu the Great has a yellow dragon and a black turtle helping Yu to create the geographical features of China, and to name them - details not found in Shan Hai Jing.[ref]

Wheel of Fortune (often known simply as WheelThe simplified title is often used by host Pat Sajak on-air, and has been used instead of the full title in numerous promotional materials for the show.) is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles, similar to those used in Hangman, to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel. 
Wheel premiered as a daytime series on NBC on January 6, 1975, and continued to air on the network until June 30, 1989. After some changes were made to its format, the daytime series returned on July 17, 1989 as part of CBS' daytime lineup. On January 14, 1991, Wheel moved back to NBC and aired on that network until it was cancelled on September 20, 1991. The popularity of the daytime series led to a nightly syndicated edition being developed; that series premiered on September 19, 1983 and continues to air to this day.
The network version was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, with Charlie O'Donnell as its announcer. O'Donnell left in 1980, Woolery in 1981, and Stafford in 1982; they were replaced, respectively, by Jack Clark, Pat Sajak, and Vanna White. After Clark's death in 1988, M. G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O'Donnell returned in 1989; O'Donnell remained on the network version until its cancellation, and continued to announce on the syndicated show until his death in 2010, after which he was replaced by Jim Thornton, who has been the announcer since. Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late-night talk show, and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke. Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS, then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether.

This is a list of members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1869 to 1872. Elections for the sixth Legislative Assembly were held between 3 December 1869 and 10 January 1870 with parliament first meeting on 27 January 1870. There were 72 members elected for 52 single member electorates, 6 two member electorates and 2 four member electorates. Due to a change in the NSW Constitution the maximum term of this parliament was reduced from 5 years to 3. However the assembly was dissolved after only 25 months after the third government of James Martin lost a vote of supply.
There was no party system in New South Wales politics until 1887. Under the constitution, ministers were required to resign to recontest their seats in a by-election when appointed. These by-elections are only noted when the minister was defeated; in general, he was elected unopposed.

Wound In Wall  is the debut album of the dark wave/post-punk band Feeding Fingers, released [tpl]start date|2007|8|28[/tpl]. Wound In Wall was the result of the purging of a large back-catalog of music that was written by Justin Curfman from aged 16 onward from 1996 to 2005 that never found a home in any of his film projects. The decision was made to re-arrange the music in such a way so as to be performed by a trio for the public during a lull between two of Curfman's film projects, Platelets: Lepidopteraphage and TICKS. But, the decision was made to carry on with Feeding Fingers beyond the initial release and to become something more than a short lived creative vacation from Curfman's film work.http://gothicrock.ru/din/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.217
Their first album was well received and found an audience most prominently in Middle- and Eastern-Europe.  Criticism of Justin Curfman's vocal likeness to Robert Smith has been disputed by Curfman himself, stating that "The similarity is not intentional. The quality and tone of my voice is what it is and I am not going to alter my delivery, tip toe around the association, or apologize... I don’t know that I can go through puberty twice, so for the time being, this is my voice."http://www.justincurfman.com/treffpunkt_schwarz_transcript_interview_with_justin_curfman.htm
More than often, Wound In Wall is compared to that of Joy Division, Cocteau Twins, Echo and The Bunnymen, and early-Cure albums, like Seventeen Seconds, Faith, Pornography.http://gothicrock.ru/din/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.217http://www.treffpunkt-schwarz.de/interview-mit-feeding-fingers

The Battle of Maroua–Miskin (18–21 January 1902) was the decisive military confrontation between the Fulani troops of Amir Djubayru b. Aadama and the German Schutztruppe, which solidified the German rule of northern Cameroon.
On the Fulani side, 500 to 800 men were killed. Djubayru fled into the Mandara Mountains at the border area to Nigeria. Head of operations on the German side was Lieutenant Hans Dominik, who after the battle occupied Maroua, the important center of the Fulani, and from there successively forced other regional leaders under German authority. With the military defeat and expulsion of Djubayru as a spiritual and political overlord of the Fulani in Adamawa, the German colonial administration broke the historic ties to the Fulani's center Yola and replaced them with the connection to the seat of the residency Garoua as a new political and economic center.

Maryland Million Turf Sprint Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually in October since 2004 primarily at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland or at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. To be eligible for the Maryland Million Turf Sprint Handicap, a horse must be sired by a stallion who stands in Maryland. Due to that restriction the race is classified as a non-graded or "listed" stakes race and is not eligible for grading by the American Graded Stakes Committee.
The race is part of Maryland Million Day, a twelve-race program held in mid October that was the creation of renowned television sports journalist Jim McKay. The "Maryland Million" is the first State-Bred showcase event ever created. Since 1986, 27 other events in twenty states have imitated the showcase and its structure.Maryland Million 2008, October 4, Laurel Park, Official Souvenir Guide for 23rd Running, page 4 and 5.
In its sixth running in 2009, the race was restricted to those horses who were sired by a stallion who stands in the State of Maryland. Both the entrant horse and their stallion must be nominated to the Maryland Million program.

[[Cryptothallus mirabilis]]
CATEGORIES: Metzgeriales, Parasitic plants

Cryptothallus mirabilis is a species of liverworts in the family Aneuraceae, and was first described in 1933.[tpl]cite book | last = Schuster | first = Rudolf M. | year = 1992 | title = The Hepaticae and Anthocerotae of North America | volume=V | pages=574–579 | location=Chicago | publisher = Field Museum of Natural History | isbn = 0-914868-20-9 [/tpl]  Plants of this species are white as a result of lacking chlorophyll, and their plastids do not differentiate into chloroplasts.[tpl]cite journal | last=Sigee | first=D. C. | year=1969 | title=The fine structure of plastids in the apical region of the gametophyte of Cryptothallus mirabilis Malmb. | journal=Transactions of the British Bryological society | volume=5 | issue=4 | pages=820–822 [/tpl] Apart from lacking chlorophyll, Cryptothallus is very similar to the genus Aneura, and the validity of recognizing Cryptothallus as a separate genus has been questioned by Renzaglia, who suggests it may be considered "merely as an achlorophyllous species of Aneura."[tpl]cite book | last=Renzaglia | first=Karen S. | year=1982 | title=A comparative developmental investigation of the gametophyte generation in the Metzgeriales (Hepatophyta) | series=Bryophytorum Bibliotheca | volume=24 | location=Vaduz | publisher=J. Cramer [/tpl]
Cryptothallus mirabilis is a subterranean myco-heterotroph that obtains its nutrients from the abundant fungi growing among its tissues rather than from photosynthesis.  Until recently, it was the only species of bryophyte known with this combination of characteristics,[tpl]cite book | last=Schofield | first=W. B. | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Bryology | pages=184, 192 | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-02-949660-8 [/tpl] but a second species Cryptothallus hirsutus was discovered in Costa Rica in 1996.[tpl]cite journal | last=Crum | first=Howard | coauthors=James Bruce | year=1996 | title=A new species of Cryptothallus from Costa Rica | journal=The Bryologist | volume=99 | issue=4 | pages=433–438 [/tpl] The infecting fungus is a basidiomycete, which is also the case in fungi associated with the related genera Aneura and Riccardia. However, this is not the case for other members of the Metzgeriales that have been studied.
The plants are small, seldom growing more than three centimeters long.  They grow in bogs and are typically found underneath peat moss or other dense moss growth near birch trees.[tpl]cite journal | last=Hill | first=David Jackson | year=1969 | title=The absence of chlorophyll in the spores of Cryptothallus mirabilis Malmb. | journal=Transactions of the British Bryological society | volume=5 | issue=4 | pages=818–819 [/tpl]  Plants have been found in locations across northern Europe, and once in Greenland.
The species is dioicous, with individual plants producing either antheridia or archegonia, but never both.  The female plants (with archegonia) are typically ten times the size of the male plants.  The development of reproductive structures in Cryptothallus is not controlled by photoperiod, but does require a temperature of at least [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F[/tpl] following a period of sufficiently low temperature.[tpl]cite book | last=Chopra | first=R. N. | coauthors=P. K. Kumra | year=1988 | title=Biology of Bryophytes | pages=93–96 | location=New York | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | isbn=0-470-21359-0 [/tpl]

The Ruhr uprising ([tpl]lang-de|Ruhraufstand[/tpl]) or Märzaufstand was a left-wing workers' revolt in the Ruhr region of Germany in March 1920. The uprising took place initially in support of the call for a general strike issued by the Social Democrat members of the German government, the unions and other parties in response to the right-wing Kapp Putsch of 13 March 1920.
However, the communists and socialists in the Ruhr had previously laid plans for "winning political power by the dictatorship of the proletariat" in the event of a general strike. After the collapse of the Kapp Putsch, the German government sent in the Reichswehr (the German army) and rightwing Freikorps, to crush the ongoing insurgency of the around 50,000 members of the "Red Ruhr Army". This was done with considerable brutality and involved numerous summary executions.

The Rappenkrieg was a peasant uprising lasting from 1591–1594, involving a conflict between the Swiss city of Basel and the surrounding   Prince-Bishopric of Basel.  
At issue was an increase in the rate of sales tax on wine and meat.   After several years the conflict was ended through negitiations headed up by the Basel merchant turned politician Andreas Ryff.
The name "Rappenkrieg" comes from the local word, Rappen, then as now the term for a low value coin:  "Rappenkrieg" can be loosely translated as the "Pence/Cents War".
The Basel Rappenkrieg is not to be confused with the Rappenkrieg in Western Austria from 1612 to 1614 in the adjacent Fricktal and the Rhine, although both had similar causes.

It also co-stars Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei, who previously starred in Jay Chou's Secret. The movie was filmed in Qingdao at the Qingdao Polar Ocean World and received promotion from the Qingdao council.
It was announced that it was to be released in spring 2010, but the release date was pushed back to 24 June 2010, which opened the 2010 Shanghai International Film Festival on 2 June. Jet Li wants this film to get a good message across and promote the works with autism as well as the works of his charity ‘The One Foundation’.  
Xue Xiaolu, a teacher at the Beijing Film Academy, wrote and directed the 7 million yuan (US$1 million) movie.
The first-time director has been a volunteer for 14 years with Beijing Stars and Rain, a non-governmental educational organization for children with autism. The story was mostly based on her personal real life and experience. She said, "With the addition of actors like Gwei Lun-Mei and Wen Zhang, I am even more confident in the film production."http://www.wuxiasociety.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=523&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=150
At first nobody was willing to take a risk on such a non-commercial script until film mogul Bill Kong, the man behind Hero (Yingxiong) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wohu Canglong) stepped in. It saw the inclusion of award winning cinematographer Christopher Doyle (Hero, 2046, In the Mood for Love), composer Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away, Departures, Hana-bi) and production designer Yee Chung-Man (Anna Magdalena, Curse of the Golden Flower).

The Hecker Uprising was an attempt by Baden revolutionary leaders Friedrich Hecker, Gustav von Struve, and several other radical democrats in April 1848 to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic in the Grand Duchy of Baden.  The main action of the uprising consisted of an armed civilian militia under the leadership of Friedrich Hecker moving from Konstanz in the direction of Karlsruhe with the intention of joining with another armed group under the leadership of Georg Herwegh there to topple the government.  The two groups were halted independently by the troops of the German Confederation before they could combine forces.  The Hecker Uprising was the first large uprising of the Baden Revolution and became, along with its leader, part of the national myth.

CATEGORIES: Hiking trails in Michigan, Protected areas of Keweenaw County, Michigan, Isle Royale National Park

The Greenstone Ridge Trail is a [tpl]convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] hiking trail on Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Michigan. All of the island is included in Isle Royale National Park, and hence the trail is also totally within park boundaries.  The trail extends from a harbor on the island's western end, Windigo, to a harbor and lodge on its eastern end, Rock Harbor. As there are no paved roads in this wilderness area and park, the trail doubles as the primary means of land transportation on the island.[ref]
</ref><ref name="Whitesel">[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-isle-royale-national-park-houghton-michigan-sidwcmdev_054469.html |title=Across Isle Royale by Foot |work=gorp.com |accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl]</ref>
The trail generally follows the top of Greenstone Ridge, a low ridge that forms the spine of the island, and surmounts Mount Desor, the highest point of Isle Royale.  Hikers appreciate the elevation, which to some extent separates them from assaults by mosquitoes that are found in great numbers in the island's lower-lying wetlands.  Hikers often look out for signs of the island's megafauna, moose and wolves; although scarce and shy, these animals live all about the scrubby woodlands that adjoin the trail.  
The Greenstone Ridge and its Trail are both named after chlorastrolite, a local semiprecious stone that is the state gem of the U.S. state of Michigan.  On Isle Royale this rock is known as "greenstone."

[[Mathematical sciences]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical sciences

Mathematical sciences is a broad term that includes, in addition to areas of mathematics, those academic disciplines that are primarily mathematical in nature but may not be universally considered subfields of mathematics proper. Statistics, for example, is mathematical in its methods but grew out of political arithmetic which merged with inverse probability and grew through applications in the social sciences, some areas of physics and biometrics to become its own separate, though closely allied field. Computer science, computational science, population genetics, operations research, cryptology, econometrics, theoretical physics, and actuarial science are other fields that may be considered part of mathematical sciences.
Some institutions offer degrees in mathematical sciences (e.g., the United States Military Academy and University of Khartoum) or applied mathematical sciences (e.g., the University of Rhode Island).

Stefano Lentini (born November 26, 1974) is an Italian composer and musician born in Rome, Italy. Lentini has released music and soundtracks of varying styles, from the electro-rock of Il sorteggio and the ethnic folk of Bakhita to the symphonic instrumentation of 84 Urne. Stefano Lentini collaborated to the soundtrack of The Grandmasters directed by Wong Kar Wai and premiered at Berlin International Film Festival on February 7, 2013. Lentini makes use of a variety of instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same track and writes music in various time signatures. He is considered part of the cross-chamber music, but his influences are very broad. His music has been likened to orchestral, ambient music, world music and aesthetically compared to the film music of Ennio Morricone and Alexandre Desplat. Lentini' music often has spiritual themes, and many songs draw inspiration from real stories.

Herbert Dixon, a congregational layman, had held Sabbath School for around 40 years in the school house at Upperville, and by his untiring efforts succeeded in raising funds toward building a chapel in Upperville. At last he bought the property and deeded it to the Friends on the condition that they hold services there for ten years.  Walter Whitney of the Methodist Church in Smyrna conducted services there from 1935-37. Eventually the congregation became so small that services were no longer held. In 1965 the Society voted to sell the building and it was bought by Mrs. John A. Leavitt of Glastonbury, Connecticut, whose daughter, Mrs. Robert Anderson, was a resident of Smyrna. 
The meeting house became unused and passed though several private hands. It was purchased by Terrance Lindall in the mid-1980s and became the Greenwood Museum. Lindall purchased the rectory next to it and the house opposite intending to create a cultural and recreational facility. Exhibits included objects from  a Gothic chapel, quilts of Margit Echols, and French Empire furnishing. Events included wreath making and chess tournaments. He released the property to the Quakers in Hamilton, New York so it could once more be used for its intended purpose.The Upperville Meeting House

From 1539 he was cantor at the Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell, where he was ordained in 1546. In 1548 he was appointed choir master for life. In 1550 he traveled to his home country to acquire instruments for the chapel.
In 1577 he retired to Balaguer, but after a year moved to become maestro di cappella at Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona, which he left shortly afterwards, apparently due to health problems. Then in 1579 he returned to la Seu d'Urgell, where he remained until his death, having previously been replaced by Rafael Coma.Grove's dictionary of music and musicians, Volume 1 Sir George Grove, Eric Blom - Music - 1954 Page 977

CATEGORIES: United Methodist churches in New York, Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in New York, Gothic Revival architecture in New York, Religious buildings completed in 1893, 19th-century Methodist church buildings, Churches in Albany County, New York

Newtonville United Methodist Church is a historic United Methodist church on Louden Road at Maxwell Road in Newtonville, New York.
There has been a Methodist congregation meeting at the present site of the church since 1828. Three area congregations merged to the Newtonville location in 1858, and the church was called Asbury Chapel. When the building then in use exceeded its physical limitations, the current building was constructed. This new structure, built for a cost of $11,150.00 and paid for in 3 years, was called "Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church." The congregation was incorporated as the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Newtonville in 1916.
The current late gothic revival structure was built in 1893, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In the late 1940s the men of the church dug, by hand, a cellar to create space for a fellowship hall under the sanctuary. An education structure was added to the rear of the main sanctuary building in 1959. A sexton's cottage, also dating to the late 19th century, sits next to the church building. The former parsonage on the site was removed in the early 1960s, and the church's carriage sheds were destroyed by fire.

[[Battle of Huete]]
CATEGORIES: Battles of the Middle Ages, Conflicts in 1164, 1164 in Europe, Battles involving Castile, 12th century in Spain

The Battle of Huete took place in 1164 between the Lara family and its allies, and the Castro family and its supporters. It was part of the civil war which engulfed the Kingdom of Castile following the death of Sancho III (1158), wherein competing factions sought control of his minor son and successor, Alfonso VIII. In 1162 the same two factions had met at the Battle of Lobregal. At Huete the Lara leaders were the three brothers Manrique, Nuño, and Álvaro Pérez de Lara. The Castro were led by Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, who had been in exile at the court of Ferdinand II of León since 1160.
Fernando was with the court of León at least as late as 16 April, but by early summer he was in the castle of Huete in Toledo amassing forces for an invasion of Castile. According to the mid-thirteenth-century Crónica de la población de Ávila the town of Ávila joined with the king and "his other vassals", obviously the Lara and their allies, and "went to besiege Toledo", where Fernando was.Sánchez de Mora, 148: alçosse don Fernán Ruiz de Castro con Toledo e con otros lugares que teníe. E moviéronse el concejo de Ávila con el rey don Alfonso e con los otros sus vasallos ... e fueron a çercar Toledo. It explains how the Castilians "chased Fernando from place to place" and forced him to abandon the kingdom, that is, the kingdom of Toledo, which Ferdinand of León had conquered in 1162.Sánchez de Mora, 148–49: corrió tras don Fernán Ruiz de logar en logar, sirviéndole lealmente sus vasallos ... e echó a don Fernán Ruiz de reyno. It is probable that Fernando fled to Huete at this time. Manrique, bringing the child Alfonso VIII along with him, led a force against Fernando at Huete. In the words of the Chronica latina regum castellae, "at that time Count Manrique fought against Fernando Rodríguez, who had with him the people of Huete. The Count had with him the child king".Sánchez de Mora, 148: Illo tempore comes Malricus pugnauit contra Fernandum Roderici, cum quo erat populus Obtensis. Comes autem secum habebat regem puerum. Fernando's troops were drawn from Toledo and the Transierra, especially the towns of Huete, Toledo, and Zorita.Sánchez de Mora, 147–50. According to the late Crónica de Veinte Reyes Manrique demanded that Fernando turn over the castle of Huete, but the latter refused, citing Sancho III's command that tenants should continue to hold their royal fiefs until Alfonso VIII came of age. Manrique then ordered his brother Nuño to guard the young king and take him to Zorita if he was in any danger.
Battle was joined in front of Huete and, as at Lobregal, the Castro were the victors. This time Manrique was killed in the field by Fernando. Nevertheless the young Alfonso remained in the control of the Lara and Fernando was forced to return to León. After Manrique's death, his brothers led the retreat to Zorita with the king and from there to Ávila, where the prelates with them negotiated their reception and afterwards a cessation to hostilities. The date of this battle is uncertain. The Anales toledanos primeros date it to 9 July and note Manrique's death: "They killed Count Manrique on the ninth day of the month of July in the Era 1202 AD 1164]."In Flórez, 391: Mataron al Conde Manrich en IX. dias del mes de Julio Era MCCII. There is a charter in the Becerro mayor de Aguilar de Campoo (the main cartulary of the monastery of Santa María la Real de Aguilar) dated 21 June 1164, an earlier source than the Anales, that places the battle on 3 June:
 
 . . .in the year this charter was written when Fernando Rodríguez with those of Toledo and of Huete fought with the count Don Manrique and this same count Don Manrique was killed, and many other Castilians him. . . This charter was made on the fifth day of the week, the eleventh kalends of July 21 June. Under the Era 1202 1164. Fifteen and three days before this charter was made June Count Don Manrique and his knights were killed.Quoted in Barton, 264 n1: . . .in illo anno fuit ista carta scripta quando Fernando Rodriz con los de Toleto et de Uepte lidio con el comite don Marric et fuit mortuus ibi el comite don Marric, et alios castellanos multos. . . Facta carta notu die Va feria XI kalendas iulii. Sub Era MCCII. Quindecim et tres dies antea fuit ista carta facta quam mortuus fuisset Comite don Marric et suos milites.

The cartulary copy of this charter is much later than 1164 and it is not improbable that its dating clause is in error.

[[Second Aceh Expedition]]
CATEGORIES: Aceh War, Dutch conquest of Indonesia

The Dutch dispatched a second expedition in Aceh in late 1873 during the Aceh War following the failed First Aceh Expedition of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army to Aceh. 
At that time this expedition was one of the largest Dutch ever launched in the Indonesian archipelago, the expedition consisted of 8,500 troops, 4,500 servants and coolies, and a reserve of 1,500 troops was later added. Both the Dutch and Acehnese suffered from disease (mostly cholera) during this time. 1,400 colonial soldiers died between November 1873 and April 1874. After the Acehnese abandoned their capital, Banda Aceh, the Dutch moved into the capital on January 1874 thinking the Acehnese had surrendered and they had had won the war. They announced that the Aceh Sultanate was dissolved and that Aceh was annexed.  
Foreign powers thus refrained from interference, however, Acehnese resistance remained. Sultan Mahmud Syah and his followers withdrew to the hills and jungles territory of Aceh, where Sultan Mahmud eventually died of cholera.  The Acehnese proclaimed a young grandson of Tuanku Ibrahim, named Tuanku Muhammad Daud Syah, as Sultan Ibrahim Mansur Syah (r. 1874-1903) and continued their struggle in the hills and jungles territory as guerrilla.

The First Aceh Expedition was a punitive expedition of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army against Aceh.
Early in 1873, the American Consul in Singapore had discussions with an Achenese emissary about a possible Acehnese-American treaty, which the Dutch saw as justification for intervention. In March 1873, the Dutch bombed the Acehnese capital Banda Aceh (Kutaraja) and in April they landed 3,000 troops led by Johan Harmen Rudolf Köhler. Having misjudged their Acehnese opposition, the Dutch were forced to withdraw losing Köhler and eighty men. They then established a blockade and Acehnese troops (estimates of whom range from 10,000 to 100,000) prepared for battle.

The Chinese uprising in Mandor (Borneo) in 1884 and 1885 was an uprising of ethnic Chinese, helped by the Dayaks, against the Dutch East Indies government.
This was the Dutch view of events - i.e. as an area already under Dutch rule, where that rule was threatened by an uprising. The insurgents appear to have seen things differently, evidently considering themselves as the last-ditch defenders of overwhelmingly Chinese Lanfang Republic which had existed in the area since the late 18th Century, upholding it against a Dutch invasion which put a final end to its existence in 1884-85.

The Soetardjo Petition was a petition from some progressive Indonesians, which in 1936 was submitted to the Indonesian People's Council (Volksraad) of the Dutch East Indies. The name comes from the name of the petitioner, Soetardjo Kartohadikusumo.
The document expressed the desire of Indonesians to, within a period of ten years, be independent under Article 1 of the Dutch Constitution.
On November 16, 1938, the petition was rejected because it was considered that the Indonesians were not yet ready for independence, even within the Dutch commonwealth. This rejection encouraged the nationalist movement in Indonesia to be more radical. It led to the formation of the GAPI in 1939.

The Eerste Divisie "7 December" or "First Division 7 December" was a division of the Royal Netherlands Army, active from at least 1946 to 2004. It was sent to the Dutch East Indies to restore  "peace, order and security" in 1946.  The Netherlands planned to gradually give the East Indies greater autonomy, but the proclamation of the independent Republic of Indonesia two days after Japan's capitulation accelerated these events.
The division was named after the speech of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in London on December 7, 1942: "I imagine, without prejudice to the government conference's advice, that they will focus on a National Association, which the Netherlands, Indonesia, Suriname and Curaçao will have participated together, while each in itself, its own autonomy in internal affairs and drawing on their own, but together with the will to assist, will represent. It will be difference of treatment based on race or national character have no place, but will only have the personal ability of citizens and the needs of different populations for the decisive policy of the Government."
The division was withdrawn from the East Indies in 1949–1950 and spent the remainder of the Cold War as part of NATO Northern Army Group's I (Netherlands) Corps deterring a Soviet attack on West Germany. In 1985 it had its headquarters at Schaarsbergen, and divisional troops included the 102 Reconnaissance Battalion (maintained through the Dutch mobilisation system RIM) at Hoogland.David Isby and Charles Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.331 11th Mechanised Brigade included the 12 and 48 Mechanised Battalions, the 101 Tank Battalion, and the 11 Field Artillery Battalion. 12th Mechanised Brigade was headquartered at Nunspeet and 13th Armoured Brigade at Oirschot.
After the end of the Cold War it became part of the I. German/Dutch Corps for a period. The division was disbanded on 1 January 2004 and the '7 December' title was transferred to the 11 Luchtmobiele Brigade (11th Airmobile Brigade).http://www.7decemberdivisie.nl/pages/organisatie.html

[[Dutch sand ladder]]
CATEGORIES: Hiking

A Dutch sand ladder is a cable or rope ladder with rungs usually made of wood, lying on a sandy slope to allow persons to ascend or descend with minimal erosion. The bottom end is anchored and the top end is designed for easy disconnection so that the ladder can be lifted up to shake loose any sand that has accumulated on the rungs. The ability to be easily maintained and reset makes sand ladders useful trail features for steep sand dunes or other easily eroded areas where permanent structures are infeasible or impractical.

[[Star for Loyalty and Merit]]
CATEGORIES: Dutch East Indies, Orders, decorations, and medals of the Netherlands

The Star for Loyalty and Merit (Dutch: Ster voor Trouw en Verdienste) was a civilian award established on 1 January 1894 by Governor-General Carel Herman Aart van der Wijck of the Dutch East Indies. The star replaced the old Medal for Civil Merit, which had limited prestige and status according to the Netherlands government. The star was awarded in gold to "significant and meritorious" natives, and in silver to village chiefs and leaders of the "Eastern foreigner" (i.e. Chinese) communities. Dutch (Europeans) were not eligible to receive the star.
The star was considered the colonial equivalent of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (or at least the "Brother" grade associated with the Order), as well as the medals and the Knight's Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau.
The star ceased to be awarded after 1949.

[[Jeremy Castro Baguyos]]
CATEGORIES: Living people, Filipino academics, 1968 births

Jeremy Castro Baguyos (born 1968, Quezon City, Philippines) is a musician-researcher specializing in the realization of live interactive computer music. Based at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (USA), he is an Associate Professor of Music.
His most notable contributions to the field are in the area of live performance combined with interactive computer technology.  For the state of Nebraska (USA), Baguyos established the state's first interactive computer music ensemble, Ensemble A.M.I. (Artificial Music Initiative), in conjunction with its first and only electronic music festival featuring interactive computer music, Virtual Music Week.  For his own instrument, the double bass, he was one of the early practitioners of interactive computer music performance on the double bass.  Inspired by the early electronic pioneers such as Robert Black and Bertram Turetzky, Baguyos studied computer music at the Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University It was at Peabody that he performed with the Peabody Computer Music Consort and collaborated with other students of computer music and established composers of computer music who shared his enthusiasm for the emerging art form.  The result was the performance, between 2002 and 2005, of some of the first significant repertoire for double bass and interactive electronics and probably the very first double bass repertoire to utilize the MSP extensions to the Max (software) digital audio programming language. It is for this reason, his work differed from the few earlier experiments in interactive computer music for double bass. His realizations in public presentation were implemented in software as opposed to reliance on the much more limited hardware-based synthesis. He performed repertoire that utilized real-time audio capture and DSP, the use of automation in live performance, and simulations of musical machine intelligence. His experimental work in this area has been recorded on the "Music From SEAMUS" annual CD series of the Society for Electroacoustic Music in the United States as well as his own solo CD released in 2005, "Uncoiled Oscillations," (OCD).  
He appears frequently at notable academic conferences such as the International Computer Music Conference the Society for Electroacoustic Music in the United States., 
and the Seoul International Computer Music Festival.  He is also the Principal Double Bassist of the Des Moines Metro Opera Summer Festival Orchestra.

The 1740 Batavia massacre ([tpl]lang-nl|Chinezenmoord[/tpl], literally "Murder of the Chinese"; [tpl]lang-id|Geger Pacinan[/tpl], meaning "Chinatown Tumult") was a pogrom of ethnic Chinese in the port city of Batavia  (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence inside the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived.
In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.
The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible etymology for the names of several areas in Jakarta.

He is also known for his theoretical work on the nature of history, especially on the relationship between history and the social sciences.  He has consistently challenged academic orthodoxies, and been a radical voice in successive debates about the direction of social and cultural history since the 1970s. While his research has ranged widely from the politics of class in Victorian England to the formation of the modern self, it has always shown a preoccupation with liberalism, governance and the nature of freedom. Although his work has concentrated on Britain, its influence has registered worldwide, not only in Britain and North America.
He was born in Paddington, London in 1945, the child of Irish rural immigrants.  He was educated in a West London secondary modern school, and worked after leaving school early, before studying history and English literature at the University of Keele.  He did his graduate work in history at Balliol College Oxford.  He is Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Manchester, and has been appointed to numerous visiting professorships in history and sociology, including at the University of California, Berkeley and San Diego; the London School of Economics; and the European University Institute in Florence.

sbt is the de facto build tool for the Scala community,Public repositories hosted on github which mention sbt used by the Lift web frameworkGetting started for Lift and Play Framework.
Typesafe Inc., Scala's commercial outlet, has called sbt "arguably the best tool for building Scala projects", with the two most prominent key features being incremental compilation and an interactive shell.[tpl]cite web|title=Zinc and Incremental Compilation|url=http://blog.typesafe.com/zinc-and-incremental-compilation|publisher = typesafe's blog|date = 13 August 2012| accessdate = 22 August 2012[/tpl] When continuous compilation mode is entered, the Scala compiler is only once instantiated which eliminates subsequent startup costs, and source file changes are tracked so that only affected dependencies are recompiled. The interactive console allows modifying build settings on the fly and entering the Scala REPL along with all class files of the project.[tpl]cite web|last=Goldin|first=Evgeny|title=SBT Scala Build Tool|url=http://www.methodsandtools.com/tools/scalabuildtool.php| accessdate = 7 May 2012[/tpl] The popularity of the incremental compilation has prompted Typesafe to extract this feature in the form of an independent component called Zinc.

[[Synonym (database)]]
CATEGORIES: Relational model, Data structures, Data modeling, Database management systems, Databases

A synonym is an alias or alternate name for a table, view, sequence, or other schema object. They are used mainly to make it easy for users to access database objects owned by other users. They hide the underlying object's identity and make it harder for a malicious program or user to target the underlying object. Because a synonym is just an alternate name for an object, it requires no storage other than its definition. When an application uses a synonym, the DBMS forwards the request to the synonym's underlying base object. By coding your programs to use synonyms instead of database object names, you insulate yourself from any changes in the name, ownership, or object locations. If you frequently refer to a database object that has a long name, you might appreciate being able to refer to it with a shorter name without having to rename it and alter the code referring to it.
Synonyms are very powerful from the point of view of allowing users access to objects that do not lie within their schema. All synonyms have to be created explicitly with the CREATE SYNONYM command and the underlying objects can be located in the same database or in other databases that are connected by [tpl]clarify span|database links|date=September 2012[/tpl].
There are two major uses of synonyms:
When you create a table or a procedure, it is created in your schema, and other users can access it only by using your schema name as a prefix to the object's name.  The way around for this is for the schema owner creates a synonym with the same name as the table name.

CATEGORIES: 1909 births, 1995 deaths, British anti-war activists, British conscientious objectors, British pacifists, Pacifism

Humphrey Sims Moore (1909-1995) was the founder of Peace News, the British pacifist magazine. 
Moore was a Quaker who had been born in Samoa where his father had been teaching. He joined the No More War Movement and embraced various socialist causes, while working as a journalist. In 1933 he became editor of the National Peace Council's publications. 
Working with a peace group in Wood Green, London, Moore and his wife, Kathleen (playing the role of business manager),Harry Mister “Kathleen Moore 1907-1996” Peace News No. 2402 launched Peace News with a free trial issue in June 1936. [ref]Caroline Moorehead,
Troublesome People: Enemies of War : 1916-1986. Hamish Hamilton, 1987
ISBN 0241121051, (p.126).[/ref] With good distribution possible through Moore’s contacts through the National Peace Council, the new magazine rapidly attracted attention. Within six weeks, Dick Sheppard,  founder of the Peace Pledge Union proposed to Moore that Peace News should become the PPU’s paper.Harry Mister “Humphrey Moore 1909-1995” Peace News No. 2395 Early contributors to this new organ of the PPU included Gandhi, George Lansbury, and cartoonist Arthur Wragg.
Sales of Peace News peaked at around 40,000 during the so-called Phoney War following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and before major land battles in Europe. 
In May 1940, in the face of demands in parliament for the banning of the paper, the printer and distributors stopped working with Peace News. However, together with the typographer Eric Gill, Hugh Brock and his brother Ashley, and many others, Moore continued to publish Peace News and arrange for distribution around the UK. At more or less the same time Moore faced a conscientious objector's tribunal at which he was exempted from war service.
Humphrey Moore’s emphasis on Peace News having a single-minded anti-war policy was increasingly being challenged as the war went on. Others wanted greater emphasis on building a peaceful society once hostilities ended. In 1940 the PPU appointed John Middleton Murry to edit the paper, asking Moore to stay on as assistant editor. Moore eventually resigned in 1944 to join the News Chronicle. Later, he worked on newspapers in Birmingham .

[[Asbestos Mountains]]
CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of South Africa, Asbestos, Kimberley, Northern Cape

The Asbestos Mountains is a range of hills in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, stretching SSW from Kuruman, where the range is known as the Kuruman Hills, to Prieska. The range lies about 150 km west of Kimberley and rises from the Ghaap Plateau.
The mountains were named for the asbestos which was mined in the 1900s and is found as a variety of amphibole called crocidolite. Veins occur in slaty rocks, and are associated with jaspers and quartzites rich in magnetite and brown iron-ore. Geologically it belongs to the Griquatown series. 
The Griquas, for whom Griquatown was named,  were a Khoikhoi people who in 1800 were led by a freed slave, Adam Kok, from Piketberg in the western Cape to the foothills of the Asbestos Mountains where they settled at a place called Klaarwater. John Campbell, (1766–1840), a Scottish missionary in South Africa, renamed it Griquatown in 1813. The mission station became a staging post for expeditions to the interior - here David Livingstone met his future wife, Mary Moffat, daughter of the missionary Robert Moffat - William Burchell visited here in 1811.   
John Campbell described the mountains in his book "Travels in South Africa: Undertaken at the request of the Missionary Society":
[tpl]Quote|Daylight discovered the beauty of the scenery that surrounded Hardcastle. An outpost near Griquatown It lies in a valley not above three miles in circumference surrounded by the Asbestos Mountains of diversified shapes. There are four long passes between the mountains, leading from it in different directions, which not only increase the convenience of the situation, but add greatly to the grandeur of the prospect around. Some of us walked after breakfast to examine the asbestos rocks, where we found plenty of that rare mineral between strata of rocks. That which becomes, by a little beating, soft as cotton, is all of Prussian blue. When ascending a mountain alone, I found some of the colour of gold, but not soft, or of a cotton texture like the blue; some I found white, and brown, and green &c. Had this land been known to the ancients in the days of imperial Rome, many a mercantile pilgrimage would have been made to the Asbestos Mountains in Griqualand. Were the ladies' gowns in England woven of this substance, many lives would annually be saved, that are lost by their dress catching fire.|John Campbell|[tpl]cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Travels in South Africa.

The colour variants which Campbell found, are named, because of their chatoyance,  "Tiger's Eye", "Hawk's Eye", and "Cat's Eye" by lapidaries and are silicified crocidolite. http://www.quartzpage.de/eyes.html

[[Public distribution system (India)]]

CATEGORIES: Poverty in India, Government of India, Welfare in India, Food politics, Food security, Civil Supplies

Public distribution system (PDS) is an Indian food security system. Established by the Government of India under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution and managed jointly with state governments in India, it distributes subsidized food and non-food items to India's poor. Major commodities distributed include staple food grains, such as wheat, rice, sugar, and kerosene, through a network of Public distribution shops, also known as Ration shops  established in several states across the country. Food Corporation of India, a Government-owned corporation, procures and maintains the Public Distribution System.
In terms of both coverage and public expenditure, it is considered to be the most important food security network. However, the food grains supplied by the ration shops are not enough to meet the consumption needs of the poor or are of inferior quality. The average level of consumption of PDS grains in India is only 1 kg per person / month. The PDS has been criticised for its urban bias and its failure to serve the poorer sections of the population effectively. The targeted PDS is costly and gives rise to much corruption in the process of extricating the poor from those who are less needy. Today, India has the largest stock of grain in the world besides China, the government spends Rs. 750 billion ($13.6 billion) per year, almost 1 percent of GDP, yet 21% remain undernourished.[tpl]cite news |title=As Grain Piles Up, India’s Poor Still Go Hungry |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/business/global/a-failed-food-system-in-india-prompts-an-intense-review.html?_r=1&smid=FB-nytimes&WT.mc_id=BU-E-FB-SM-LIN-AGP-060812-NYT-NA&WT.mc_ev=click |publisher=New York Times |date=June 7, 2012[/tpl] Distribution of food grains to poor people throughout the country is managed by state governments.

Warp Zone is Martyr's 2nd full-length album. It was released independently on March 11, 2000. A European edition was released by Sekhmet Records which contained two bonus tracks, several live videos and other multi-media. In October 2006, Galy Records released a re-issue containing four bonus tracks.
Matt Heafy of Trivium called it one of his favorite albums and said "This has been a hugely influential album on me, and they’re a band that I feel are way underrated. They’re a band so many people haven’t heard about but this album is truly a gem. Everyone’s putting technical and jazz elements of things like virtuoso guitarist Allan Holdsworth in there, but these guys were doing it before all of them and Martyr don’t do it for the sake of it, they do it for the sake of new sounding songs. The band incorporate jazz, thrash, death and tech and so much more. They really have their own sound." Metalhammer UK Website: My Top Ten Essential Metal Albums Retrieved May 13, 2010

Dalit literature, or literature about the Dalits, an oppressed Indian class under the Indian caste system, forms an important and distinct part of Indian literature.Dalit literatureBrief Introduction to Dalit Literature Dalit literature emerged into the forefront and as a prominent voice after 1960, starting with the Marathi language, and soon appeared in languages like Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil languages, through narratives such as, poems, short stories, and most importantly autobiographies, which stood out due to their stark portrayal of reality and the Dalit political scene.[tpl]cite news |title=‘Dalit literature reflects oppression of Dalits’  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/09/stories/2009090958010200.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date= March 19, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=TAMIL: Dalit literature  |url=http://www.hindu.com/br/2008/02/26/stories/2008022650051400.htm |publisher=The Hindu |date=February 26, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Healing with languages  |url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2006/08/06/stories/2006080600160400.htm |publisher=The Hindu|date=August 6, 2006 [/tpl] 
Dalit literature denounced as petty and false the then prevailing rather bourgeois and romantic portrayal of life by the Sadashiv Pethi literature. The silence of the Sadashiv Pethi literature on Dalit issues was highly conspicuous by the absence of any mention of the abject poverty-stricken lifestyle of the Dalits, and the utter oppression the Dalits faced, at that time, from the higher castes. It is often compared with the African-American literature especially in its depiction of issues of racial segregation and injustice, as seen in Slave narratives Dalit literature and African-American literature.

[[Theory of Forms]]
CATEGORIES: Platonism, Epistemological theories, Natural philosophy, Metaphysical theories, Form

Plato's theory of Forms or theory of IdeasModern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respected tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W D Ross, Plato's Theory of Ideas (1951) and this reference site. The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. The term was used at least as early as Diogenes Laertius, who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" [tpl]lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει[/tpl]...., [tpl]cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | pages=Paragraph 15[/tpl]Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called form in English translations and idea in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include idéa, morphē, eîdos, and parádeigma, but also génos, phýsis, and ousía. He also uses expressions such as to x auto, "the x itself" or kath' auto "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen, in Platon-Lexikon, Darmstadt 2007, p. 157. asserts that non-material abstract (but substantial) forms (or ideas), and not the material world of change known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality.Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them. Plato's theory of forms (or ideas) When used in this sense, the word form or idea is often capitalized."Chapter 28: Form" of The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World (Vol. II). Encyclopaedia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that Form or Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind." Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only true objects of study that can provide us with genuine knowledge; thus even apart from the very controversial status of the theory, Plato's own views are much in doubt.[tpl]Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0[/tpl]  Plato spoke of Forms in formulating a possible solution to the problem of universals.

[[Ayrton-Perry winding]]
CATEGORIES: Electromagnetic coils

Ayrton-Perry winding is a type of bifilar winding pattern used in winding wire on forms to make electronic components.  Its advantage is that the resulting coil of wire has low values of parasitic inductance and parasitic capacitance.K. Padmanabhan, Electronic Components, Laxmi Publications, ISBN 81-7008-969-7, page 16  Ayrton-Perry windings of resistance wire are used to make wirewound RF resistors that are used at high frequencies, where inductance and capacitance are unwanted.
The winding is made of two separate wires wound in opposing directions along an insulating form and connected in parallel at the ends.  Since there are the same number of turns of wire in either direction, the magnetic fields of the two wires cancel each other out, so the coil has little inductance;  and since adjacent turns of the two wires are at approximately the same voltage, there is little parasitic capacitance between the turns.    
One disadvantage is that because the two lengths of resistive wire are connected in parallel, four times the length of wire (twice the length for each coil) is needed to make a given resistance than if a single coil was used.

It focused on communist-ruled Eastern Europe and was particularly known for reporting on human rights abuses there. The magazine was known for its conservative and anti-socialist views which led to several controversial reactions from viewers and politicians. Löwenthal criticized communists, East Germany, leftist student movement (″red psychoterrorists″), social democrats' Ostpolitik (″communist agents″), the so-called peace movement (″Moscow's partisans″) and West German writers like Heinrich Böll (″sympathizers of leftist fascism″).http://www.tv-legenden.de/zeitgeschehen/rote-optik-und-zdf-magazin-vs-schwarzer-kanal/

CATEGORIES: United States Supreme Court cases, 1796 in United States case law, United States foreign relations case law

Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796) is a United States Supreme Court case where a divided court ruled that an article in the Treaty of Paris, which provided that creditors on both sides should meet no lawful impediment when recovering bona fide debts, took precedence and overruled a Virginia law passed during the American Revolution which had nullified such debts.  The full title of the case is Ware, administrator of Jones, Plaintiff in Error v. Hylton et al.  It is also known as the British Debt case.
"The treaty of peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain, in 1783, enabled British creditors to recover debts previously owing to them by American citizens, notwithstanding a payment into a state treasury, under a state law of sequestration.  An individual citizen of one state cannot set up the violation of a public treaty, by the other contracting party, to avoid an obligation arising under such treaty; the power to declare a treaty void, for such cause, rests solely with the government, which may, or may not, exercise its option in the premises."Reports of Cases Ruled and Adjudged in the Several Courts of the United States and of Pennsylvania Held at the Seat of the Federal Government, Volume III, edited by Dallas, Alexander J, Banks Law Publishing, New York, 1905 p. 198.  Justice Iredell delivered the controlling opinion of the Court.
"Patrick Henry, John Marshall, Alexander Campbell, and James Innis appeared for the American debtors, and Andrew Ronald, John Wickham 'the eloquent, the witty, and the graceful,' and Starke, and Baker, for the
English creditors."Quoted Flanders, Henry The Life of John Marshall, pp 30-31, Philadelphia, T. & J. W. Johnson & Co., 1905.  
John Marshall's argument before the bar won him great admiration at the time of its delivery, and enlarged the circle 
of his reputation.Quoted Flanders, Henry The Life of John Marshall, p 38, Philadelphia, T. & J. W. Johnson & Co., 1905.  Flanders also added the reader of Marshall's argument "cannot fail to be impressed
with the vigor, rigorous analysis, and close reasoning that mark every sentence of it."  
Oral argument in the case was reenacted at Mount Vernon in 2011, with U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito presiding.  Historic Mount Vernon and the U.S. Supreme Court Historical Society cosponsored the event.Bookout, Ann, "Annual Report of the Regent," Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Annual Report, Two Thousand Ten (Mount Vernon, Va. 2011), pp. 15-16.

Bowett was awarded a CBE 1983 and was  Knighted in 1998.Professor Sir Derek Bowett Cambridge University, Squire Law Library 
Raised near Manchester Bowett was a chorister at Manchester Cathedral, attended William Hulme's Grammar School and joined the Royal Navy at 18 years of age in 1945.  After demobilisation he studied law at Downing College, Cambridge. After gaining a first class degree Bowett was encouraged to continue his studies by Hersch Lauterpacht the then Whewell Professor of International Law.Sir Derek Bowett: international lawyer Obituary Times Online  3. August, 2009
His PhD (1958) was on “Self Defence in International Law”.
He was highly esteemed as a lawyer: J. P. Gardner (Director of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law)  wrote in the Introduction to Bowett’s book International Court of Justice (1997), that his “….experience of international litigation is unrivalled…” 
In 2007 he recorded a series of interviews for the Cambridge law faculty recalling his career, which are published on its website. The transcript, with its unaffected identification not only of those he respected as inspirations, but also those he regarded as lazy, poor lawyers or fools, preserves an authentic echo of the Bowett voice, immediately recognisable by those who knew him.
Sir Derek’s association with Queens’ College was long and eventful, and documented in a series of six amusing and elegantly written articles in the “Queens’ College Record” (20042, 20053, 20064, 2007-95).

[[Marbella blast furnaces]]

CATEGORIES: Marbella, Economy of Spain

The Marbella blast furnaces ([tpl]lang-es|altos hornos de Marbella[/tpl]) were the first iron works in Spain.
The blast furnaces in Marbella were built after the discovery of iron ore deposits  in Ojén because of the availability of charcoal in the Sierra Blanca mountain range and the supply of water from the Verde River. In August and September of 1826, two societies called La Concepción and El Angel were established,  the first promoted by Manuel Agustín Heredia, the second by Joan Giró.
The furnaces at one time accounted for 75 per cent of the iron smelted in Spain, but iron produced in charcoal-fired kilns was much more expensive than that obtained by using coke as fuel; consequently the steel industry in Marbella died out due to competition from the more efficient steel producers of the north.

Another has been the alliance with local populations, against more powerful European colonial powers.

Anna-Maria Haas was a Viennese woman, who on May 3, 1982, was distinguished by Yad Vashem as Righteous among the nations.
Haas helped the Jewish family Josef and Sidonie Rubin-Bittman and supported them over several years during the Second World War. She was married to Benno Haas, who, as a Jew, was persecuted in Nazi Germany.
Haas lived in the 9th district in the neighborhood of the family Rubin-Bittman. She
knew them and had contact with them. After the family Rubin-Bittman had left their flat in 1939 and had to live in disguise, Haas decided - as far as it was possible - to help Josef and Sidonie. They often had to change  their hiding places. Haas persistently supplied them with free food.
Sidonie was a relative of Martin Buber's coming from Lemberg. In 1944, Josef and Sidonie hid in a cellar space of a house. Here Sidonie bore her first son Fritz. That year he was the only Jewish child born in Vienna. Anna-Maria visited them often in their hiding place and brought them food, milk and baby food.
Although he was made to live as a disguised under heavy and dangerous conditions, Josef tried to help
Hungarian Jews who had already been selected by the Gestapo for a transport to an Extermination camp. He also began a relief operation for a Jewish child camp in Ferdinandstrasse in the 2nd district. Haas supplied him with food and medication for the child camp. Josef and Sidonie survived the war, and Josef became a successful businessman. Sidonie died in 1968 after long suffering. Josef died on April 25, 1972 at the age of 75.
Anna-Maria Haas died in Vienna in 1996.

IMEI Number Allocation:The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a 15-digit decimal number required to identify terminal equipment when it is used on a GSM/UMTS mobile phone network. To ensure traceability of each item of equipment connected to the network, the IMEI must be unique and manufacturers must ensure no duplication of IMEI.
This requires the registration of companies onto the IMEI database before the allocation of TAC (part of the IMEI) numbers. IMEI numbers are a global resource. The allocation of a TAC does not imply ownership of an IMEI by either the organisation to which the TAC is allocated or by the organisation performing the allocation function. The overriding principles for the allocation and management of IMEI are preservation of the available number range, the prevention of duplication and the maintenance of security.
Quality Testing : MSAI helps Mobile phones manufacturers and national Importers with Mobile quality analysis and recommendation. MSAI does field testing in all 23 circles and produce various reports such as Failure testing report & Defect report.

The species was once common in Dian Lake, but has since 1950's dramatically declined; today, only few individuals are occasionally captured. Its decline is caused by introduced fish species, pollution, the loss of macrophytes (in part due to grass carp), over-fishing, and the loss of breeding sites. Along with many other fish species endemic to Dian Lake, it is a threatened species.

[[21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]]
CATEGORIES: Massachusetts Civil War regiments

The 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was organized in Worcester, Massachusetts and mustered into service on August 23, 1861.
After garrison duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the regiment served with the Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations on the coast of North Carolina, and participated in the Battle of Roanoke Island and the Battle of New Bern among other engagements. Burnside's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862. The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the Army of the Potomac and participated in several of the largest battles of the Civil War, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. The most devastating engagement of the war for the 21st was the Battle of Chantilly, fought on September 1, 1862, during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties.Walcott, xv. From March 1863 to January 1864, the 21st served with Burnside in the Department of the Ohio, seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864, the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment was a favorite of Clara Barton, the famed battlefield nurse, who was also from Worcester County, Massachusetts.Oates, 33.
By the end of its three years of service, the 21st Massachusetts had been reduced from 1,000 men to fewer than 100. Of these losses, 152 were killed in action or died from wounds received in action, approximately 400 were discharged due to wounds, 69 were taken prisoner, and approximately 300 were discharged due to disease, resignation, or desertion. Those of the 21st who chose to re-enlist at the end of their initial three-year commitment were eventually consolidated with the 36th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on October 21, 1864.Bowen, 345.

CATEGORIES: French racehorse owners and breeders, Horse farms in France

Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard was a Thoroughbred horse breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme in the Orne department in Lower Normandy purchased by Marcel Boussac in 1919. Widely respected, Marcel Boussac was called "the greatest of French breeders" by John P. Sparkman, an editor with Thoroughbred Times. http://www.bluewatersales.com/consignments-ft-nov-06.shtml. Boussac's highly successful operation produced a number of racing champions through its numerous top foundation broodmares and world class sires.
Among the many top runners from Haras de Fresnay-Le-Buffard were Corrida, Djebel, Pharis, Ardan, and Marsyas. For breeding purposes, Marcel Boussac purchased the United States Triple Crown winner Whirlaway and sold the mare La Troienne to Edward R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky who became one of the most influential mares to be imported into the U.S. in the 20th century. He also bred raced, and ultimately sold Ambiorix to Claiborne Farm in Kentucky who became the Leading sire in North America in 1961.
Following the German occupation of France the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country including those at Haras de Fresnay-Le-Buffard who were shipped to Germany to be used for breeding at the German National Stud. Following the end of the War in 1945, some of theses horses were recovered and returned to stud duty. 
French Champion sires bred at Haras de Fresnay-Le-Buffard were:
In the late 1970s, Marcel Boussac's business empire ran into severe financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy.  Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard was sold to Fresnay Agricole S.A. who owned it for only a short time before selling it to Stavros Niarchos.

[[High Sheriff of Westmeath]]

The High Sheriff of Westmeath was the British Crown's judicial representative in County Westmeath, Ireland from its creation under The Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act of 1543 until 1922, when the office was abolished in the new Free State and replaced by the office of Westmeath County Sheriff. The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. The following is an incomplete list: all addresses are in County Westmeath unless stated otherwise.

[[Active audience theory]]
CATEGORIES: Media theories

Active audience theory argues that media audiences do not just receive information passively but are actively involved, often unconsciously, in making sense of the message within their personal and social contexts.[tpl]cite book|last=Munday|first=Daniel Chandler, Rod|title=A dictionary of media and communication|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956875-8|edition=1st ed.[/tpl] Decoding of a media message may therefore be influenced by such things as family background, beliefs, values, culture, interests, education and experiences. 
Other theories and models are compatible with active audience theory, including the Encoding/Decoding model and the Uses and gratifications theory, which states that audiences are actively involved in determining what media they engage with and how, in order to gratify specific needs or desires.[tpl]cite book|last=McQuail,|first=D., Blumler, J. G., & Brown, J. R.|title=The television audience: A revised perspective. Media studies: A reader|year=1972|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=271–284[/tpl] The Mass media article refers to a Culturalist theory, however there is little evidence of its use in relation to (mass) media. 
Active audience theory is seen as a direct contrast to the Effects traditions, however Jenny Kitzinger argues against discounting the effect or influence media can have on an audience, acknowledging that an active audience does not mean that media effect or influence is not possible.[tpl]cite book|last=Kitzinger|first=J|title=A sociology of media power: key issues in audience reception research. Message Received.|year=1999|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow|pages=238, 207–43[/tpl] Supporting this view, other theories combine the concepts of active audience theory and the effects model, such as the 
two step flow theory where Katz and Lazarsfeld argue that persuasive media texts are filtered through opinion leaders who are in a position to 'influence' the targeted audience through social networks and peer groups.

The American Institute of Architects describes Detroit's Financial District as "one of the city's highest concentrations of quality commercial architecture".Eric J.

 From the 1850s to the 1970s the Financial District in downtown Detroit was the financial and office heart of the city, and it stills retains an important banking and office presence today. Banks began to locate along Jefferson Avenue in the Griswold and Shelby streets area in the 1830s. Substantial office buildings, often containing banks in their street levels, began to line Griswold in the 1850s. Detroit's massive early twentieth-century auto industry-related growth and economic boom resulted in large-scale redevelopment of the area between 1900 and 1930, and another wave of development took place in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Financial District continues today to be an important financial and office district in Detroit.[tpl]cite web|title=Weekly Highlight 12/24/2009 Detroit Financial District, Wayne County, Michigan | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/09_12_24_detroit_financial_district.htm[/tpl]

In the new millennium, the 47-story Penobscot Building stands at the center of the district as a state of the art class-A office tower and serves as a hub for the city's wireless Internet zone and fiber-optic communication network. Other major class-A office renovations include the Chrysler House and the Guardian Building, a National Historic Landmark.Rebecca Mazzei (11-30-2005).Still Standing Metro Times. Retrieved on July 4, 2010. The Financial District is served by the Detroit People Mover. Viewed from the International Riverfront, the district is bordered on the left by the 150 West Jefferson skyscraper which replaced the Detroit Stock Exchange Building and on the right by the One Woodward Avenue skyscraper.

[[George Washington's Headquarters (Cumberland, Maryland)]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Allegany County, Maryland, Visitor attractions in Allegany County, Maryland

[tpl]About|a specific headquarters of George Washington||Washington's Headquarters (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Washington's Headquarters[/tpl]
The Headquarters of George Washington is a historic site located at 38 Greene Street in the historic downtown district of Cumberland, Maryland in central Allegheny County (39° 38.975′ N, 78° 45.885′ W). The centerpiece and primary attraction at the site is a historic log cabin twice occupied by George Washington, the first President of the United States of America. The cabin resides an area known today as Riverside Park, but was originally built about 2 blocks away, the original site is located nearby at 16 Washington Street. 
Historical Significance
The cabin was originally built by General Edward Braddock's men, between 1755 and 1758 for then Colonel George Washington’s use during his service in the French and Indian War. He would later return and also used it briefly during 1794 then as the Commander in Chief, in order to review the troops gathered to put down the Whiskey Rebellion. This site is notable as it signifies Washington’s first military command. The original site lies on a hill that overlooks Wills Creek and the Potomac River. It was once the location of Fort Cumberland (Maryland) and today, The Emmanuel Episcopal Church (Cumberland, Maryland). The headquarters was part of Fort Cumberland during the French and Indian War and it is the only building to survive from the original Fort.
Riverside Park Site and Exhibits 
The headquarters historical markerat the site claims that the headquarters "antedate all similar headquarters in the United States". Below is the text of that historical marker’s plaque in its entirety, courtesy of the Historical Marker Database:
 As colonel under General Braddock at Fort Cumberland during the French and Indian War 1755 - 1758 and as Commander-in-Chief of the American Army in 1794
 Presented to the City of Cumberland by
James Walter Thomas, L.L.D.; Litt.D.
Dedicated April 21, 1921 in the presence of
General John J. Pershing
Commander of American Armies
Major C.E.D. Bridges
Military Attaché of British Embassy
Hon. Albert C. Ritchie
Governor of Maryland
Dr. Thomas W. Koon
Mayor of Cumberland
Judge Ferdinand Williams
Presiding Officer
These headquarters, built by General Braddock's men for George Washington, antedate all similar headquarters in the United States. Here Washington acquired the military training, which distinguished him as the preeminently great American Soldier.
The single room cabin itself remains largely closed to the public, with the exception rare, special occasions when the cabin is opened, such as Cumberland’s annual “Heritage Days” festival. Visitors are otherwise free to explore the grounds, and encouraged to approach the cabin. Upon stepping up onto the porch and peering in through the windows, visitors are treated to a collection of historical displays and period artifacts furnished by the local chapter of The Daughters of the American Revolution. The exhibit inside features period-correct furniture, weaponry, flags and even a life-size wax reproduction of Washington himself. The Daughters of the American Revolution also oversees events and hosts the public on the occasions that the cabin is open. Additionally, visitors may enjoy an informative audio recording though speakers situated on the front porch. The recording may be accessed via a doorbell-style button featured prominently next to the front window, and serves in the absence of a full time tour guide. The brief recording features music and provides visitors with a basic history of the structure, and its context within George Washington’s military career. 
Though not directly part of The Headquarters of George Washington, a reconstructed section of Fort Cumberland’s defensive outer wall stands on the far side of the Riverside park complex. The nearby hilltop where Fort Cumberland and the headquarters once stood is now the site of The Emmanuel Episcopal Church. The Church was built directly on top of the old Fort’s foundations and the original earthwork chambers used for storing food and ammunition still exist. Today these chambers form a network of tunnels and room that can be safely and easily accessed.
Restoration & Relocation
The structures exact original location within Fort Cumberland’s perimeter has unfortunately been lost to history as it not included on surviving maps of the period. However the account s of many of the area’s late nineteenth century residents and an 1878 survey of historic Cumberland homes narrow the space to a single residential lot, the former home of one O.C. Gerhardt.  That survey A History of Cumberland, and its author, Will H. Lowdermilk are also cite the earliest documented modification of the original cabin, noting that it was at one point expanded to a one and half story dwelling. The cabin remained in use to some degree, until 1844, when the land upon which it stood was purchased for residential development by one Judge Thomas Perry.  According to   A History of Cumberland, Judge Perry recognized and appreciated the buildings immense historical value and in an effort to preserve it, sold it to a close acquaintance; one George Blocher.  Judge Perry and Mr. Blocher oversaw the cabin’s careful dis-assembly and mile long voyage to a nearby farm on Bedford Road.
It was only after an undefined period of dormancy out on the Bedford Road farm that cabin and the Riverside Park complex we know today began to take shape. At some point the structure was purchased by local historian James Walter Thomas, reportedly with the intention of returning the cabin to its rightful, original place at the former site of Fort Cumberland.  The cabin was subsequently entrusted to and restored by contractor William J. Morley. Morley was likely selected for having previously restored a similar structure at Valley Forge, in Eastern Pennsylvania. Valley Forge coincidentally also being the site of another historic trial for George Washington and the then fledgling United States.  
The April 1921 issue of the Cumberland Evening Times offers rare details concerning the actual restoration processes.  According to that newspaper report; “The entire groundwork as it stood when occupied by Washington was intact and was used, as were the rafters, plates, and binders, and nothing new has been added, except the best tile roof obtainable.” The report did also note however, that in the case of a few logs too far decayed for use were substituted from the next oldest building in town (The Black Horse Tavern, on South Mechanic Street) were substituted. Local official were eager to facilitate the project by donating the land that would become Riverside Park in exchange for Thomas’s counter donation of the cabin itself. The cabin was officially designated “George Washington’s Headquarters”, and the site as it exists today was born in 1921.   
Authenticity &Controversy 
Shortly after the site’s dedication, local Police and Fire Commissioner A.K. Hummelshime attacked the Cabins authenticity in a letter to then Cumberland Mayor Thomas Koon.  Hummelshime attacked the project’s legitimacy claiming that the logs used were gathered from disparate locations spanning a period of one hundred and fifty years, essentially claiming the cabin’s connection to George Washington was fabricated. These allegations were addressed during a confrontation between Hummelshime and the Mayor at the March 14th 1921 City Council meeting in which Hummelshime was ultimately forced to concede that the charges in his letter where based on hearsay.     
Acknowledgments/Registries    
Since its official public dedication the site has been under stewards hip of the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, who in addition to hosting occasional events, have outfitted the cabin with period correct furniture, clothes, weapons and assorted relics. Since 1975, the site has been listed in the Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties, but does not appear on the National Registry due to its having been moved in the past. The site is also featured as a prominent location along the Fort Cumberland Walking Trail.

The raid on Boulogne in 1801 was a failed attempt by elements of the Royal Navy led by Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson to destroy a flotilla of French vessels anchored in the port of Boulogne, a fleet which was thought to be used for the invasion of England, during the French Revolutionary Wars. At dawn on August 4, Nelson ordered five bomb vessels to move forward and open fire against the French line. Despite the inferior gunpowder of French artillery and the high number of shots fired by the bomb vessels, the British sustained more casualties and withdrew. The night of 16 August Nelson returned and tried to bring off the flotilla, attacking with seventy boats and nearly two thousand men organized into four divisions, but the attack was successfully repelled by the defenders, led by Admiral Latouche Tréville.

Maria was the wife of tsar Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria. She was the last empress-consort (tsaritsa) of the First Bulgarian Empire.
Her antecedents are unknown. It is believed that Maria was married to Ivan Vladislav in the late 10th century. Her husband was the son of Aron, who was the brother of Emperor Samuel (Samuil) of Bulgaria. In 987 Samuel ordered his brother Aron executed for treason together with his entire family. The massacre was survived only by Ivan Vladislav, who was saved through the intercession of his cousin, Samuel's son Gabriel Radomir.
Tsar Samuil died in 1014 and the Bulgarian throne was inherited by his son Gavril Radomir. In 1015 Ivan Vladislav murdered his savior Gavrail Radomir, while the latter was hunting near Ostrovo (Arnissa), and seized the Bulgarian throne.
Maria's husband followed the determined policy of his predecessors to resist the ongoing Byzantine conquest over Bulgaria, but he was killed before the walls of Dyrrhachium in the winter of 1018. After his death the widowed empress Maria and much of the Bulgarian nobility and court submitted to the advancing Basil II in exchange of guarantees for the preservation of their lives, status, and property. Maria together with her children were sent to Constantinople, where she was granted the title zostē patrikia (lady-in-waiting of the empress). Her family was integrated into the Byzantine court and provincial aristocracy.
In 1029 Maria together with her son Presian entered a conspiracy against emperor Romanos III Argyros. The plot was discovered, Presian was blinded and Maria was exiled to a monastery in Asia Minor.

This also ended in disappointment, however, as the Final was lost 2–0 to Livingston.

Alhaji Muhammadu Shehu Kangiwa was the first elected civilian governor of Sokoto State, Nigeria in the short-lived Nigerian Second Republic, holding office from  October 1979 to November 1981. He represented the National Party of Nigeria (NPN).[ref]
</ref>
He was a popular governor, providing water, health care, agricultural input, education at all levels and transparent government.[ref]
</ref>
The Bakolori irrigation project, started by the previous military government, had displaced many peasant farmers without providing land or compensation. Confronted by demonstrators in November 1979, Kangiwa promised to address all their grievances. However, on 28 April 1980 police moved in on unarmed demonstrators and shot dead over 380 people. The government played down the incident, claiming only 25 had died.[ref]
</ref>
He imprisoned Sheikh Zakzaky of the Islamic movement in Nigeria, along with some of his close disciples, and was said to have intended to execute him.[ref]
</ref>
In 1981, he increased the number of Local Government Areas in the state from 19 to 32. However his successor Colonel Garba Duba reversed this measure in 1984.[ref]

Construction of the channel, together with improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball, to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river, cost £1.4 million, and was completed in 1972.[tpl]cite book|last=Otter|first=R.

CATEGORIES: Measuring instruments

A dead weight tester  apparatus uses known traceable weights to apply pressure to a fluid for checking the accuracy of readings from a pressure gauge.  A dead weight tester (DWT) is a calibration standard method that uses a piston cylinder on which a load is placed to make an equilibrium with an applied pressure underneath the piston. Deadweight testers are so called primary standards which means that the pressure measured by a deadweight tester is defined through other quantities: length, mass and time.
Typically deadweight testers are used in calibration laboratories to calibrate pressure transfer standards like electronic pressure measuring devices.

The R. N. Linn House, also known as the Robert A. and Eleanor C. Nordyke Residence, at 2013 Kakela Drive in Honolulu, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, was built in 1928 in the style of architecture then emerging in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i during the 1920s. Although it is relatively modest cottage, it exhibits such typical elements of that style as a double-pitched hip roof (also known as a Dickey roof), exposed rafters, casement windows, an open floor plan, Chinese interior motifs, and a panoramic view. Its architect was J. Alvin Shadinger, who was noted especially for his interior designs. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
Many of the leading architects in Honolulu during the 1920s consciously employed both European and Asian motifs in their designs, as they pursued a distinctive Hawaiian style of architecture that celebrated the multiethnic roots of Island society. Among the most influential was Hart Wood, whose artful blending of motifs can still be seen in the First Chinese Church of Christ, the Alexander & Baldwin Building, and the Gump Building (all built in 1929), as well as in several grand private residences. The R. N. Linn house is one of the few fine middle-class homes from that period to show similar Chinese influences.
Reuben N. Linn was a court reporter and his wife Merle taught at Waialua Elementary School. They had acquired a lot of Chinese household furniture during a trip to China in 1922, and this likely influenced their choice of interior design. They lived in the house until 1950, when Mrs. Linn died. The Nordykes, who were friends of the Linns, bought the house in 1960. In 1961, Mrs. Nordyke gave birth to twin daughters in the same maternity ward at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children where Ann Dunham was giving birth to Barack Obama. The twins were classmates of the future President at Noelani Elementary School and then at Punahou School.[tpl]cite web |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Dec/22/ln/hawaii812220320.html |title=Twin sisters, Obama on parallel paths for years |work=Honolulu Advertiser |date=22 December 2008 |author=Dan Nakaso |accessdate=2010-01-10 [/tpl]

[[Dry rot treatment]]

CATEGORIES: Building defects, Construction, Moisture protection

Dry rot treatment refers to the techniques used to eliminate dry rot fungus and alleviate the damage done by the fungus to human-built wooden structures.
The commonly held view of an outbreak of the dry rot fungus (Serpula lacrymans) within a building is that it is an extremely serious infestation that is hard to eradicate and requires drastic remedies.  The traditional “orthodox” approach to treatment practised by most remedial timber treatment and damp proofing companies accordingly specifies the stripping out can be eradicated simply by controlling the environment of the area in which it is growing in terms of reduced moisture levels and increased ventilation.
It is universally accepted that the first priority is to make repairs to rectify the cause of the dampness within the building that allowed the dry rot outbreak to occur in the first place and to promote the drying out of the affected area by taking measures such as increasing ventilation. It is in the way in which the affected building fabric is treated after this that the approaches differ.

The United States House of Representative elections of 1998 in North Carolina were held on 3 November 1998 as part of the biennial election to the United States House of Representatives.  All twelve seats in North Carolina, and 435 nation-wide, were elected.

Eleven incumbents won re-election, while Democrat Bill Hefner's retirement in the 8th district allowed Republican Robin Hayes to enter the House for the first time.  The Libertarian Party ran in every district, almost quadrupling their total vote share, but their vote was smaller than the margin of victory in all races.
It is not to be confused with the election to the North Carolina House of Representatives, which was held on the same day.

The Brewhouse Theatre and Arts Centre (or The Brewhouse) is the largest theatre and arts centre in Taunton, a town in Somerset, England.
The building opened March 28, 1977, on the banks of the River Tone, and offers a 350 seat auditorium and supporting studio and exhibition spaces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebrewhouse.net/inside.php|title=About us|publisher=Brewhouse Theatre |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] Its first professional production was Alan Ayckbourn’s The Norman Conquests, starring the then unknown David Jason.
The administrative offices are on the first floor of a Georgian Grade II listed building which gives the theatre its name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=269666|title=Old Brewery House|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, Arts Council England announced that it would cut regular funding to The Brewhouse from 2006, following a drop in artistic output. In September 2005 a new director Robert Miles was appointed to lead the artistic reinvigoration of the organisation, which now plays host to experimental theatre companies such as DEREVO, and No Fit State Circus. It was also the first theatre, apart from the Royal Court Theatre, to stage Caryl Churchill's controversial play Seven Jewish Children.
In 2009, ongoing under funding, combined with the impact of recession and a subsequent threat of cuts meant the venue was once again put under threat of closure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2009/apr/02/theatre|title=Brewhouse theatre should be rewarded for its reinvention – not at risk|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2009-04-02|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] With support from its stakeholders The Brewhouse overcame these immediate funding concerns and in March 2010 it was announced that the organisation had been awarded £487,500 from Arts Council England's Sustain fund to allow it to continue to programme arts and participatory activities during the economic downturn.The Stage web site - "Young Vic receives biggest theatre Sustain grant of £1.2m"
A feasibility study by ArtsService recommends the current site be expanded to create a 600–750 seat auditorium, a larger gallery space and arthouse cinema with improved bar and catering provision as part of a new "Coal Orchard" - Taunton’s cultural quarter.Brewhouse web site - "Past, Present and Future"

[[Historical GDP of the People's Republic of China]]

CATEGORIES: Economic history of the People's Republic of China, Economy of China-related lists, Gross domestic product, Lists by economic indicators

This article includes a list of China's historical gross domestic product (GDP) values, the market value of all final goods and services produced by a nation in a given year. The GDP dollar estimates presented here are either calculated at market or government official exchange rates (nominal), or derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations. This article also includes historical GDP growth.
In 1985, the State Council of China (SCC) approved to establish a SNA (System of National Accounting), use the GDP to measure the national economy. China started the study of theoretical foundation, guiding, and accounting model etc., for establishing a new system of national economic accounting. In 1986, as the first citizen of the People's Republic of China to receive a Ph.D. in economics from an overseas country, Dr. Fengbo Zhang headed Chinese Macroeconomic Research - the key research project of the seventh Five-Year Plan of China, as well as completing and publishing the China GDP data by China's own research. The summary of the above has been included in the book "Chinese Macroeconomic Structure and Policy" (June 1988) edited by Fengbo Zhang, and collectively authored by the Research Center of the SCC. This is the first GDP data which was published by China.
The research utilized the World Bank’s method as a reference, and made the numerous appropriate adjustments based on China’s national condition. The GDP also has been converted to USD based data by utilizing the moving average exchange rate.  The research systematically completed China’s GDP and GDP per capita from 1952 to 1986 and analyzed growth rate, the change and contribution rates of each component. The research also included international comparisons. Additionally, the research compared MPS and SNA, looking at the results from the two systems from analyzing Chinese economy. This achievement created the foundation for China GDP research.
The SCC issued “The notice regarding implementation of System of National Accounting” in August 1992, the Western SNA system officially is introduced to China, replaced Soviet Union's MPS system, Western economic indicator GDP became China’s most important economic indicator. Based on Dr. Fengbo Zhang's research, in 1997, the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), in collaboration with Hitotsubashi University of Japan, re-estimated China’s GDP Data from 1952 up to 1995 based on the SNA principal.
When comparing Fengbo Zhang’s GDP measurement in the 1980s and the GDP in 1997 by the NBS and Japan’s cooperative research, the two are found to be very consistent; the deviation rate each year is very slight, between only 0.1% and 7%. During this period, there were many data adjustments, with weighting factors undergoing significant changes along with each years comparable price amendments, statistical method significant changes result in the substantial deviation. Even with science and technology as advanced as it is today, the single item survey is allowed at least ±3%, or a total of 6% deviation. Despite the extremely difficult conditions of a destroyed economy, blank theory, a lack of data, and simple methods in 1980s, there is so little deviation for such a long period of time and the comprehensiveness of the national economic indicator, indicates that the research conducted by Fengbo Zhang with the support of the extensive group he trained is extremely rigorous, and their result very precise.China Economic History Xie Fuzhan, former Director, and Ma Jiantang, current Director of the NBS, both participated in Dr. Fengbo Zhang’s research project in the 1980s, as assistant researcher and graduate student, respectively, of the Research Center of the SCC.

[[Etymology of Wicca]]
CATEGORIES: Wicca, Etymologies, Reclaimed words

In Modern English, the term Wicca ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|k|ə[/tpl]) refers to Wicca, the religion of contemporary Pagan Witchcraft.[tpl]#tag:ref|Here, the Pagan Witchcraft religion refers to those traditions which share similar theological beliefs, commemorate seasonal Sabbats and practice magical rituals; this definition was utilised by Pagan Studies scholar Ethan Doyle White.[tpl]sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=203[/tpl]|group=nb[/tpl] It is used within the Pagan community under competing definitions. One refers to the entirety of the Pagan Witchcraft movement, while the other refers explicitly to traditions included in what is now called British Traditional Wicca.[tpl]sfn|Doyle White|2010|p=203[/tpl]
Although pronounced differently, Wicca is related to the Old English word wicca, which referred to sorcerers in Anglo-Saxon England. In the early 1950s, English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, founder of the Gardnerian tradition, referred to the Pagan Witchcraft community as the Wica. He claimed to have learned the term during his initiation into the New Forest coven in 1939. By the late 1950s, Gardner's rival Charles Cardell, founder of his own tradition, had begun referring to the religion's followers as Wiccens, and possibly used Wicca in reference to the religion itself.
The inclusive use of the term Wicca—referring to the entirety of Pagan Witchcraft religion—has been traced to Britain in the early 1960s, when it was used by various groups and publicised through use in adverts, magazines, and other literary sources. It was later adopted by figures like Alex Sanders and Gavin and Yvonne Frost, who took it to the United States. There, practitioners of British Traditional Wicca adopted it exclusively for themselves as a means to differentiate their practices from those of other Pagan Witches. This exclusive meaning was countered by its popularisation as a generic term by prolific authors such as Raymond Buckland, Scott Cunningham and Silver RavenWolf. As it entered popular culture, it gained an increasingly eclectic character in its usage. During the 1990s, some attempted to distance themselves from it by utilising the term Traditional Witchcraft.

[[Alien Kulture]]

CATEGORIES: Punk genres, Islamic culture, Taqwacore, Pakistani diaspora in the United Kingdom

Alien Kulture was a British punk band active from 1979 through 1981, founded by Ausaf Abbas, Azhar Rana, Pervez Bilgrami, and self-described "token white" Huw Jones.  Inspired by the nascent punk scene, the Anti-Nazi League and the Rock Against Racism concert series, and wanting to express the frustrations of second-generation Asian immigrants during a period of ethnic tension and race riots in Britain, the members of the band turned to music to achieve politically what they had not been able to via protest rallies, and to draw on their Pakistani Muslim backgrounds to promote an Asian presence in popular culture.  They took their name as a response to then newly elected Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's stated fears of being "swamped by people with a different culture".
Seeking to express themselves as youth caught between two cultures, they wrote songs about racism and issues within the Asian community, such as arranged marriage, leading to attacks both from neo-Nazis supporting the National Front as well as other Asians who felt they were disgracing their community.  The band eventually recorded one album plus a single, "Culture Crossover", which was released by Rock Against Racism.  They attracted the support of famed BBC DJ John Peel, who said he played them on air not just because they were Asian but because he liked their music.  However, they were otherwise ignored by mainstream media, and the group came to feel their music was not having the political effect they had hoped for.  They declined an invitation to perform at a concert at Coventry Stadium in protest of racial profiling by police because Ausaf and Azhar were due to sit their finals exams at the London School of Economics that same day, and disbanded soon after, having played only 30 shows.
Today, Huw Jones works in the non-profit sector in Leeds, Pervez Bilgrami runs a successful recruitment agency with his wife, Azhar Rana is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants, and Ausaf Abbas is a managing director of an American investment bank.

Edgar Christian was born on 6 June 1908, the son of Lt Col Frank Christian RA.
He attended prep school at the Grange School, Shorncliffe Road, Folkestone and hoped to follow his brother Charles to Marlborough College; in the end he went on to Dover College which was more local, despite the fact the family moved in 1919 to Bron Dirion in North Wales.
After Dover College, Edgar went to Canada with his second cousin John Hornby ("Hornby of the North") and with him and a companion, Harold Adlard, died of starvation near the Thelon River barren lands. He was the last of the party to die, sometime after the first of June 1927. A diary kept by him detailing this misadventure, which was found placed in the stove of the cabin, was published with portions omitted in the 1930s under the title "Unflinching". The diary is kept at his old school, Dover College, but the story has been told several other times in books and plays. A fuller edition of the diary including letters to his father and mother was published as Death in the Barren Ground.
Books and plays about Edgar and his fatal adventure include:
The Bruce Valpy play Hornby was performed in the 2007 Canterbury Festival by pupils from Dover College.

[[Chronica latina regum Castellae]]
CATEGORIES: Chronicles

The  Chronica latina regum Castellae, known in Spanish as the  Crónica latina de los reyes de Castilla, both meaning "Latin Chronicle of the Kings of Castile", is a medieval Latin history of the rulers of Castile from the death of Count Fernán González in 970 to the reconquest of Córdoba by King Ferdinand III in 1236–39. It was probably composed by Juan de Soria, the Bishop of Osma and chancellor of Ferdinand III, between 1217 and 1239.Derek W. Lomax, "The Authorship of the Chronique latine des rois de Castille", Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, XL (1963), 205–11. The majority of the text deals with the reigns of Alfonso VIII (1158–1214) and Ferdinand III (1217–1252). It was designed with two purposes: for use at the royal court as a speculum principis and to defend the interests of Castile against those of the Kingdom of León. 
The Chronica originally ended in 1230 with the death of Alfonso IX of León, who was succeeded by Ferdinand III. Modern historians disagree whether the continuation down to the capture of Córdoba six years later was written by Juan de Soria or by another author.Luis Charlo Brea, "¿Un segundo autor para la última parte de la Crónica latina de los Reyes de Castilla?", Actas I Congreso Nacional de Latín Medieval (León: University of León, 1995), 251–56, argues for a second author. Francisco J. Hernández, "La corte de Fernando III y la casa real de Francia: Documentación, crónicas y monumentos", Actas del VIII Congreso de Estudios Medievales: Fernando III y su tiempo (Ávila: Fundación Sánchez Albornoz, 2003), argues for the single authorship of the bishop. One has even suggested a composition in three stages between 1223 and 1237 by the same author, Juan de Soria.Inés Fernández-Ordóñez, "La composición por etapas de la Chronica latina regum Castellae (1223–1237) de Juan de Soria", E-Spania: Revue électronique d'études hispaniques médiévales, 2 (2006). The sources of the Chronica were the documents of the royal archives, to which its author had access, although he also records events from memory. He makes little use of other narrative histories, which were the main sources of the contemporary chronicles called Chronicon mundi and De rebus Hispaniae. Juan also includes contemporaneous events from the Maghrib, the Byzantine Empire, and the Kingdom of France in order to place Castilian history in context, something neither the Chronicon nor the De rebus do, although the later histories composed at the request of Alfonso X, the Grande e general estoria and the Estoria de España do. 
The Chronica is preserved in only one late fifteenth-century manuscript, MS G-1 or 9/450, in the library of the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid. It is a copy of the original and is found on folios 89 through 122. The structure found in most printed editions, of four sections subdivided into chapters, was added by its first editor, Georges Cirot.

[[Lex Junia Licinia]]

CATEGORIES: Roman law, 62 BC

The Lex Junia Licinia or Lex Junia et Licinia was an ancient Roman law produced in 62 BC that confirmed the similar Lex Caecilia Didia of 98 BC.Cicero, Philippics 5.8, Pro Sextio 64, In Vatinium 14, Ad Atticum 2.9.1 and 4.16.5; Bobbio Scholiast 140 (Stangl). 
The Lex Junia Licinia was a consular law of Decimus Junius Silanus and Lucius Licinius Murena enacted during their consulship. This new law additionally served to protect the people's assembly from being tricked into passing laws containing hidden unrelated items that may have been misconstrued or unethical. These dubious proposals otherwise would not pass on their own merit, and so were a rider. This additional law by Murena put more enforcement to the original Didian law with greater punishment for not complying. Adam, p. 181 
It also enacted ne clam aerario legem inferri liceret, meaning that a copy of any proposed statute must be deposited before witnesses at the aerarium before it was brought to the comitia for final approval and made law. The reasoning behind this was to prevent forgery. It was to have a public open notification period of 3 nundinae (17 days market days or three Roman eight-day weeks or 24 days). This was to put any new proposed law into formal public announcement before passing.Cicero, Note V p. 429. See also rogatio.

[[Uffe (Wieda)]]
CATEGORIES: Helme basin, Rivers of Lower Saxony, Rivers of Thuringia, Nordhausen (district), Rivers of the Harz

The Uffe is a German river in the states of Lower Saxony and Thuringia.
It has its source on the Großer Bockstalskopf in Lower Saxony, a subpeak of the Ravensberg mountain, and flows through the town of Bad Sachsa down to the village Neuhof. From there the Uffe is known as the Sachsengraben ("Saxon Ditch") and continues to the village of Branderode. 
The stream then sinks into the gypsum karst, before reaching the River Wieda beyond the village of   Obersachswerfen. The Wieda, too, regularly dries up behind the hamlet of Wiedigshof.
Until the middle of the last century the Uffe divided in the village of Neuhof. The main stream flowed towards Klettenberg and Holbach where its water power was used in several mills. This stream is still called the Uffe today. The branch running towards Branderode is called the Sachsengraben and passes the villages of Branderode and Obersachswerfen before discharging below Schwinden into the Wieda, which flows into the Zorge downstream of Schwinden. The waters of the Zorge pass down the Helme, Unstrut and Saale into the Elbe.
Today the Uffe has no direct route beyond Neuhof (a sewage farm intervenes) and it now begins in front of a bridge (Branderode - Klettenberg road) about 5 metres above the Sachsengraben. Due to the lack of a link to the 'main' Uffe, it is usually dry there, is filled by springs and flows through the villages of Klettenberg and Holbach, by the B 243 federal road, onto the Ichte.
Between Bad Sachsa and Neuhof, the Uffe flows immediately past the foot of the Sachsenstein, a former coral reef in the Zechstein Sea. Here, by a section of the Northeim–Nordhausen railway, are the ruins of an old castle, the  Sachsenburg.

Anhalt Castle ([tpl]lang-de|Burg Anhalt[/tpl]) is a ruined medieval fortification near Harzgerode, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It stands on the Großer Hausberg, a hill situated between Meisdorf and Mägdesprung above the Selke valley in the Harz Mountains. It was built in around 1123 by Otto the Rich of nearby Ballenstedt. In 1140, the first castle was destroyed during a feud between the Archbishop of Magdeburg and Margrave Conrad of Meissen. The name of the state of Anhalt is derived from this castle. 
After 1147, the Ascanian margrave, Albert the Bear, had the castle rebuilt. The new castle was one of the mightiest fortifications in the Harz region and remained occupied until about 1300. The scale of the castle was comparable to that of the Wartburg in Thuringia. The dry moat with its outer rampart (the Vorwall) that surrounded the castle, had a length of 543 metres. Architecturally it is interesting that this castle was built of brick, a material uncharacteristic of its time and the area.
From 1901 to 1907 excavations were carried out on the site of the ruins under the direction of the Brunswick surveyor, Brinckmann. All that remains of the castle today are a few wall sections from the chapel, living quarters and outbuildings, and the base of the bergfried, which is about three metres high.

Frederick Harvey Whittemorehttp://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jun/10/indictment-caps-lobbyist-harvey-whittemores-dramat/ (born 17 August 1952) is an American lawyer and businessman in the Reno, Nevada area. As an influential lobbyist for the gambling, alcohol and tobacco industries, and for his own ventures, Whittemore was called "one of Nevada's most powerful men." In 2012, Whittemore came under grand jury investigation, initiated by the Federal Election Commission, to determine whether he should be indicted for breaking federal campaign contribution laws. He was charged with four felonies with convictions on three of the counts, and sentenced September 2013 to two years in prison. He was also given a $100,000 fine, along with two years supervision after his incarceration and 100 hours community service.
Whittemore was the president of Coyote Springs Investment, LLC, the land-development company behind Coyote Springs, a controversial $30 billion planned golf course community of 160,000 homes on 43,000 acres (17,000 ha) in the rural Nevada desert. Whittemore's close relationship with Senator Harry Reid came under scrutiny because of perceived legislative and political pressure favors allowing Coyote Springs to overcome regulatory problems.
Whittemore, whose daughter, Andrea Whittemore-Goad, is a chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patient, founded a research center known as the Whittemore Peterson Institute to investigate the condition. Members of the Institute notably claimed in 2009 that a mouse virus was the cause of CFS. The paper was retracted following widespread failure to replicate the finding, which was determined to be the result of laboratory contamination. Whittemore's business partners filed a civil suit against Whittemore, accusing him of improperly using company resources to support the institute.

The Stecklenburg is a ruined medieval castle in the East Harz in Germany, located on a small rise only a few hundred metres away from the village of Stecklenberg (in the borough of Thale) in the district of Harz in Saxony-Anhalt.
The castle was built in the 11th century by the Stackelbergs on the remains of an older one. In the 12th century it was destroyed in a battle, but later rebuilt. Its new owners in 1281 were the abbey in Halberstadt.
Stecklenburg was occupied until the beginning of the 18th century. After then, several of the castle buildings, such as the brewery and the castle chapel, were demolished. It fell into total ruin and was used as a quarry. Before it was completely destroyed it was placed under a protection order following an objection by the senior forester of Thale, who then worked on the preservation of the castle.
Today the ruins of Stecklenburg are a protected monument and a popular tourist destination. All that is left of the castle are a few walls from the living quarters and the remains of the keep. The ruins of Lauenburg Castle are located only a few hundred metres away from the Stecklenburg, further up the Ramberg hill.

Northwestern led early after shutting down Bowling Green's running game but Bowling Green made a comeback in the second half led by a strong passing game under quarterback Josh Harris and won 28–24. It was the seventh time the Motor City Bowl had been played and the final game of the 2003 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams.
The game between the Mid-American Conference (MAC) team Bowling Green and Big Ten Conference Northwestern was played at neutral-site Ford Field. As then organized the Motor City Bowl matched a MAC team and a team from either the Big Ten, the Big East Conference, or an at-large team. Bowling Green accepted a bid for the Motor City Bowl after losing to Miami (OH) in the MAC Championship Game.

Harris passed for 386 yards, including three touchdown passes, and rushed for Bowling Green's fourth touchdown. Harris' completion record of 38/50 and total offense of 454 yards set Motor City Bowl records.

Wright is the current holder of the New Zealand 1000 meters record with a time of 2.38.54http://www.athletics.org.nz/Article.aspx?ID=954 set in the Berlin Olympic Stadium on 17 August 1979. Although not recognised as a record at the time it was eventually ratified over 25 years later. In late 2011, Wright's time of 4:16.7 from January 1981 was also ratified as the official New Zealand women's indoor 1500 meter record though it remained the record for only a few months until it was beaten early in 2012 by Lucy van Dalen. Wright was also the 1500 meters national champion of New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom (indoors).
Wright represented Oceania in the 1979 World Cup Finals in Montreal, Canada. She represented Scotland in the World Cross Country Championships in Madrid in 1981 and the United Kingdom in dual meets in 1981 and 1982.

[[Amager Vest]]
CATEGORIES: Copenhagen city districts

Amager Vest (West Amager) is one of the ten administrative districts of Copenhagen, Denmark, located on in the north-western part of the island of Amager. It includes areas such as Islands Brygge, Ørestad and Eberts Villaby as well as the extensive meadowland of Kalvebod Fælled. The western part of Amager island is mainly an enlargement from shallow parts of the Øresund sea. The extension of western Amager began around 1930 and was finished around 1955. The main purpose was to give shelter to the southern parts of Copenhagen harbour. The enlargement is filled with rocks, sand from the sea, plaster, waste and today unknown items, making it very expensive to set up buildings there. The exhibition centre Bella Center (which hosted the environment meeting COP15 in December 2009) is one of very few exceptions from this. Even the soil is too bad for agricultural matters. Western Amager is the largest of the ten new official boroughs of Copenhagen, but has at the same time the smallest population. Only the most northern part can be considered as "urban area".

Bjørn Føyn (21 September 1898 – 8 January 1985) was a Norwegian zoologist, especially known for researching the genetics of algae.
He was born in Trondhjem as a son of educator and major Anton Christian Føyn (1865–1940) and Olga Barth Nielsen (1870–1959). He finished his secondary education at Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1918, and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.real. degree in 1927. He was a research assistant from 1923 to 1928 at the Royal Frederick University, and then under Max Hartmann at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Biologie from 1929 to 1932. He was also a research fellow in Norway during this period, and from 1932 to 1937 he worked in Bergen. From 1938 to 1968 he was a professor at the University of Oslo. He was elected as a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1938, and of the Zoologisch-Botanische Gesellschaft of Vienna in 1963.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Bjørn Føyn|encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon|first=Arne|last=Løvlie|authorlink=Arne Løvlie|editor=Helle, Knut |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Bj%C3%B8rn_F%C3%B8yn/utdypning|language=Norwegian |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]

In the 1938 popular release Arvelæren, he criticized racial biology as practiced in Nazi Germany. Then, in World War II came the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. When the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943, a protest ensued. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Nøkleby |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Nøkleby | encyclopedia=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45 |title=Universitetet |language=Norwegian |editor=Dahl, Hjeltnes, Nøkleby, Ringdal, Sørensen |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/u/u1.html#universitetet |accessdate=3 January 2010 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn= |page= [/tpl] The staff Johannes Andenæs, Eiliv Skard, Johan Christian Schreiner, Harald Krabbe Schjelderup, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Carl Jacob Arnholm, Endre Berner and Bjørn Føyn were sent to Grini concentration camp.

Vasily Ivanovich ([tpl]lang-ru|Василий Иванович[/tpl]) (1448 – January 7, 1483) was the Grand Prince of Ryazan (1456–1483), son of Grand Prince Ivan Fyodorovich.
Upon their father’s death in 1456, eight-year-old Vasily Ivanovich and his sister Feodosiya were transferred under the care of the Grand Prince Vasily II of Moscow, who would place his namestniks in Ryazan to rule over the principality in the absence of the rightful heirs. Vasily II conducted all of Ryazan’s internal and external affairs on behalf of the underage Vasily Ivanovich. In 1463, Ivan III of Russia and his mother Maria Yaroslavna let Vasily Ivanovich return to Ryazan. In the winter of that same year, the young prince came back to Moscow and married the youngest sister of Ivan III – Anna Vasilyevna – on January 28, 1464. 
As far as Vasily Ivanovich’s lasting reign is concerned, Ryazan’s relations with its neighbors were quite peaceful, especially with Moscow (thanks to his wife Anna Vasilyevna, who often stayed the city). During one of such visits, Anna of Ryazan gave birth to Ivan Vasilyevich on April 14, 1467. It is plausible that the inclusion of the Pronsk udel into the Principality of Ryazan was possible due to Anna’s mediation between her husband and Ivan III.
Shortly before his death, Vasily Ivanovich signed away two-thirds of his principality (Pereslavl, Rostislavl, Pronsk, and all the volosts and residences) in favor of his oldest son Ivan Vasilyevich. His second son Fyodor Vasilyevich received a third of the principality with the towns of Perevitsk and Old Ryazan and a third of all Pereslavl’s income. Vasily Ivanovich bequeathed to his wife Anna a fourth of all the lands that his sons received from him.
It is believed that Vasily Ivanovich also had a third son by the name of Pyotr (born in 1468 and died during Vasily’s lifetime) and a daughter named Anna, who would marry Prince Fyodor Ivanovich Belsky in January 1498.

The word "hoecakes" refers to small cornmeal cakes that were fried in the fire on the blade of a hoe. A breakfast of hoecakes and cabbage soup testifies to the humble origins of this song. According to Alan Lomax, musicologist and folklorist formerly of the Library of Congress, this tune was originally associated with African slaves brought from Niger.

Pebble-mound mice are a group of rodents from Australia in the genus Pseudomys. They are small, brownish mice with medium to long, often pinkish brown tails. They construct mounds of pebbles around their burrows, which play an important role in their social life.
There are four complementarily distributed species of pebble-mound mice in northern Australia. Their distribution appears to be limited by climatic conditions and the availability of pebbles and is thought to be the result of early Pleistocene dispersal across areas that are now inhospitable to pebble-mound mice. None of the four species is endangered.

Robert Elliott was a Scots-Irish Presbyterian clergyman who served as the chaplain of the United States House of Representatives (1806–1807) and Chaplain of the Senate of the United States (1808–1809).
Prior to 1779, Elliott along with Rev. Edward Markland, founded a classical school at Easton, Maryland.  This school was combined in 1779 with a school conducted by Rev. John Bowie to form the Easton Academy.  In this venture, Elliott was professor of mathematics, history and geography.  The venture was not a lasting success due to the incompatible temperaments of the various professors.Church-State Relationships in Education in Maryland, by Leo Joseph McCormick, page 95
Thereafter Elliott relocated to Strasburg, Pennsylvania, where in late October 1802, he advertised the opening of an academy under his superintendence, on January 1, 1803.  Elliott remained there until he and his wife sold their house and moved to Washington, D.C., so that Elliott could accept the responsibility of chaplain to Congress.Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society, Volumes 29-32, by Lancaster County Historical Society (Pa.), page 16. 
On December 1, 1806, Elliot was appointed chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives. Reverend Elliot later served as Chaplain of the Senate. In Washington, Elliott was also the principal of the Eastern Academy school on Capitol Hill, which opened on May 19, 1806.Presbyterian Historical Society, Montreat, NC.; see: http://www.phcmontreat.org/ThisDayInHistoryIndex-December.htm

Siedlęcin Tower is the 14th century tower castle, situated in a village of Siedlęcin in the administrative district of Gmina Jeżów Sudecki, within Jelenia Góra County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.
The keep in Siedlęcin is one of the best-preserved examples of such buildings in Central Europe; its construction was probably started in 1313 or 1314 by Henry I of Jawor. He and his wife Agnes of Bohemia also commissioned the medieval mural paintings in the great hall of the keep.
The Siedlęcin tower, surrounded by a moat, is a keep of a relatively modest sort, which combines the functions of housing, ceremony, and defence in a vertical disposition analogous to those found in other castles in Europe: the lower storeys were designed for defence and for trade and business; the upper floors consisted of living quarters, and fulfilled the ceremonial functions of the dukes; the topmost floor also served defensive purposes.

[[Video advertising]]
CATEGORIES: Advertising

The term video advertising encompasses online display advertisements such as Mid-Page Units (MPUs) that have video within them, but it is generally accepted[tpl]by whom|date=December 2011[/tpl] that it refers to advertising that occurs on Internet television. It is served before, during and/or after a video stream on the internet.

CATEGORIES: 1935 births, 2009 deaths, Australian logicians, Australian philosophers

Victor Howard ("Vic") Dudman (1935–2009) was an Australian logician and teacher of logic.
He was greatly influenced by Willard Van Orman Quine on whose work he based his undergraduate logic courses.
He is particularly noted for his views on the interpretation of the material conditional. David Lewis, a frequent visitor to Australian departments of logic, once noted "If Dudman's view is correct, and I cannot at the moment see what is wrong with it, then almost everything I have written on conditionals is mistaken".http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/manifesto/if.htm#intro
Jean Curthoys saw through the press and wrote an introduction to Victor Dudman's Grammar and Semantics (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).

Charles Gray FRS (baptised 20 September 1696 in Colchester, Essex, England - 12 December 1782) was a lawyer, antiquary and Tory Member of Parliament for Colchester.
Gray was baptised in 1696, the only son of George Gray, a glazier and local landowner, and his wife Elizabeth. He was educated at Colchester Royal Grammar School from 1702, before possibly spending some time at Cambridge University and entering Gray's Inn to become a lawyer in 1724. He was called to the bar in 1729 and became a bencher in 1737. Finally, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1754. In 1726 he married Sarah Creffield, née Webster, the well-off widow of Ralph Creffield, and after her death in 1751, in 1755 Gray married Mary, the daughter of Randle Wilbraham, Member of Parliament for Chester.
Gray's political career was a long one; he served in five parliaments from 1742–1755 and 1761–1780, during the reigns of George II and George III.[tpl]Cite book|first=Charles|last=Benham|authorlink=Charles Benham|title=Colchester Worthies|url=http://www.archive.org/details/colchesterworthi00benh[/tpl] By the end of his term, however, Gray was too ill to attend, being, in 1780, "too infirm and too ill to stand".[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Ottaway | first1 = Susannah R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = Richard Furnald | last3 = Vries | first3 = Jan de | last4 = Johnson | first4 = Paul | last5 = Wrightson | first5 = Keith | title = The decline of life: old age in eighteenth-century England | year = 2004 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK  | isbn = 0-521-81580-0 | page = 105 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=45nDNbDbrq0C&pg=PA105[/tpl] "A classical scholar as well as a reformer, he was one of the original trustees of the British Museum."[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Fielding | first1 = Henry | last2 = Zirker | first2 = Malvin R | title = An enquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbers and related writings | year = 1988 | publisher = Wesleyan University Press  | location = Middletown, Conn.  | isbn = 0-8195-5166-X | page = lxxiv | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yQWTDqHaItEC&pg=PR74[/tpl]
Locally, Gray is now most remembered for being given Colchester Castle as part of his marriage settlement, and subsequently making a number of efforts to preserve it for future generations. Likewise, he also purchased a great part of the surrounding land, which was, a hundred and fifty years later, given to the town to become Castle Park. In the castle itself he constructed the Italianate domed tower and the library, and founded in the latter, in 1750, the Castle Society Book Club: among the club's members was Philip Morant. The library was to contain the books of Samuel Harsnett, bequeathed to the town, and tended to and documented by Morant.[tpl]Cite web|first=Geoffrey Haward|last=Martin|authorlink=Geoffrey Martin (historian)|title=Gray, Charles (bap. 1696, d. 1782)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57285|accessdate = 11 January 2010[/tpl] He also roofed the castle in red tile, which survives. He was also responsible for management of a house, also part of his marriage settlement, which now forms Hollytrees museum, named after holly trees that Gray planted during his ownership of the building.[tpl]Cite web|title=Hollytrees Museum: Questions and answers|url=http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk/hollytrees/holly_qa.html|accessdate=21 January 2010|publisher= Colchester and Ipswich Museums Service [/tpl] The bulk of his estate was left to his friend James Round of Little Birch and his wife, Tamar, who was the daughter and heir of Gray's stepson, Peter Creffeild.

The Frei test was developed in 1925 by Wilhelm Siegmund Frei, a German dermatologist, to identify lymphogranuloma inguinale. Antigen made from sterile pus aspirated from previously unruptured abscesses, produced a reaction in patients with lymphogranuloma inguinale when injected intradermally. Other sources of antigen have been explored, most deriving from various tissues of mice infected with Chlamydia. The test is no longer used but stands as a milestone in our understanding of immunology.

Panteleimon Kotokos was born in Korçë, modern southern Albania (Northern Epirus) at 1860. After he finished middle level education in his home place he was accepted in the Theological School of Halki, in Istanbul (Constantinople). For several years he worked as a high school theology teacher.

After an agreement with the Albanian authorities, in 1937, the Ecumenical Patriarchate chose a number of highly educated religious personalities for key position in the recently declared as autocephalous, Orthodox Church of Albania. Among them were Panteleimon Kotokos as metropolitan of Gjirokastër and Eulogios Kourilas, as metropolitan of Korca. When the communist regime of Enver Hoxha came to power in Albania (1945), he was declared 'enemy of the state' and was expelled from the country. He fled to Greece where together with Eulohios Kourilas became the heads of the Northern Epirus Central Committee. On November 18, 1945, he managed to organize a massive demonstration in Athens, where 150,000 people participated. The following years he became active as a member of the exiled Northern Epirus lobby propagating discrimination of the Greek minority by the Communist regime of Albania.[tpl]cite book |last=Stephanidēs Giannēs D., Stefanidis Ioannis D. |first= |title=Stirring the Greek nation: political culture, irredentism and anti-Americanism in post-war Greece, 1945-1967|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |language=2007 |year=|pages= 40–115 |ref=|isbn=978-0-7546-6059-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j4x71iWyYNkC&dq=[/tpl]

The 2002 Motor City Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between the Boston College Eagles and the Toledo Rockets on December 26, 2002, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Boston College scored touchdowns on its first six possessions and routed Toledo 51-25.[tpl]cite news | title=BC seniors rout Rockets, go out in style | publisher=ESPN.com | date=December 26, 2002 | accessdate=2010-01-10 | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=223602649[/tpl] It was the sixth time the Motor City Bowl had been played and the final game of the 2002 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams.
The game between the Mid-American Conference (MAC) team Toledo and Big East Conference Boston College was played at neutral-site Ford Field. This was the first Motor City Bowl played at Ford Field; all previous games were played at the Pontiac Silverdome. As then organized the Motor City Bowl matched a MAC team and a team from either the Big Ten, the Big East Conference, or an at-large team. Toledo accepted a bid for the Motor City Bowl after losing to Marshall in the MAC Championship Game. Toledo entered the bowl game as the defending champion, having defeated Cincinnati in the 2001 Motor City Bowl. Boston College was the first Big East team to play in the Motor City Bowl and was playing in its fourth straight bowl game.[tpl]cite news | title=Boston College accepts bid to play in Motor City Bowl | publisher=The Argus-Press | date=December 10, 2002 | accessdate=2010-01-10 | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0W0iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y6wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5923,3250220&dq=toledo+motor+city+bowl&hl=en[/tpl]
The bowl game MVP was Boston College quarterback Brian St. Pierre, who completed 25 of 35 passes for 342 yards, a personal career high. Boston College scored on its first six possessions, and its 51 points set a Motor City Bowl record which would later be tied in the 2007 Motor City Bowl when the Purdue Boilermakers defeated the Central Michigan Chippewas 51-48. On a sour note two Toledo players were ejected during the game; one for throwing a punch and another for a late hit out of bounds on St. Pierre.

The Battle of Kaliakra[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl], usually known as the Attack of the ''Drazki ([tpl]lang-bg|Атаката на Дръзки[/tpl]) in Bulgaria, was a maritime action between four Bulgarian torpedo boats and the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye'' in the Black Sea. It took place on 21 November 1912 at 32 miles off Bulgaria's primary port of Varna.
During the course of the First Balkan War, the Ottoman Empire's supplies were dangerously limited after the battles in Kirk Kilisse and Lule Burgas and the sea route from the Romanian port Constanţa to Istanbul became vital for the Ottomans. The Ottoman navy also imposed a blockade on the Bulgarian coast and on 15 October, the commander of the cruiser Hamidiye threatened to destroy Varna and Balchik, unless the two towns surrendered.
On 21 November an Ottoman convoy was attacked by the four Bulgarian torpedo boats Drazki (Bold), Latyashti (Flying), Smeli (Brave) and Strogi (Strict). As a result of the battle, the cruiser Hamidiye was torpedoed by Drazki and suffered heavy damage; only the calm sea prevented the ship from sinking. Half-sunk with her front parts underwater, she was towed to Istanbul. After this encounter, the Turks ceased any maritime operations close to the Bulgarian coastline.

During the action the Spaniards managed to capture 55 of 63 vessels, making it one of the most complete naval captures ever made.The encyclopaedia of London, p.483 This loss was still bitterly remembered in Great Britain thirty years later at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.Parkinson p.38 The British financial losses were estimated at £ 1,500,000.
Besides the loss of the merchantships, 3144 men, and goods worth £1,5 million, the convoy's capture offset Admiral Rodney's victory in the Moonlight battleSyrett pp.136-137 and helped derail a secret British diplomatic effort to make a separate peace with Spain.Syrett pp.136-137

[[Finite element limit analysis]]
CATEGORIES: Structural analysis, Geotechnical engineering

A finite element limit analysis (FELA) uses optimisation techniques to directly compute the upper or lower bound plastic collapse load (or limit load) for a mechanical system rather than time stepping to a collapse load, as might be undertaken with conventional non-linear finite element techniques. The problem may be formulated in either a kinematic or equilibrium form.[ref]Lysmer, J. (1970). Limit analysis of plane problems in
soil mechanics. Journal of the Soil Mechanics and Foundations Division ASCE 96(4), 1311–1334.[/ref][ref]Sloan, S. (1988). Lower bound limit analysis using finite
elements and linear programming. Int. J. Num. Anal. Meth. in Geomech. 12(4), 61–77.[/ref]
The technique has been used most significantly in the field of soil mechanics for the determination of collapse loads for geotechnical problems (e.g. slope stability analysis). An alternative technique which may be used to undertake similar direct plastic collapse computations using optimization is Discontinuity layout optimization.

Aside from agomelatine, fluoxetine, and flibanserin, as of present, no other drugs have been described as NDDIs in the medical literature, despite the fact that many other existing drugs possess effects consistent with those of the definition of an NDDI. In any case, more drugs labeled specifically as NDDIs may be seen in the future.

[[What A Summer Stakes]]

CATEGORIES: Horse races in the United States, Laurel Park Racecourse, Horse races in Maryland, Recurring sporting events established in 1978

The What A Summer Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held annually in January at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. The What A Summer Stakes, is open to fillies and mares age four-years-old and up willing to race six furlongs on the dirt. It was the 26th running of the stakes race in 2010.
An ungraded stakes race, it offers a purse of $100,000. The race was previously restricted to Maryland-breds between 1978 and 1992. The race was run for fillies and mares from age three and up from 1978 through 1985 and was run under handicap conditions during that same time. The race was restricted to two year-olds from 1985 to 1992.
The race was named in honor of What A Summer, a gray mare by What Luck. She was an Eclipse Award winner and was named American Champion Sprint Horse in 1977. She was bred in Maryland by Milton Polinger. What A Summer was a foal in 1973 and won 18 of 31 starts in her career. Her most memorable race was perhaps her dominating performance in the defacto second leg of the filly Triple Crown, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. She also won the Fall Highweight Handicap twice (carrying 134 pounds each time), the Silver Spoon Handicap twice, the Maskette Handicap and four other stakes. In addition to her 18 wins she also placed nine times with earnings of $479,161. That record of 27 first or second finishes in 31 starts at 87% is among the best in history.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 466 on March 3, 2007.
What A Summer was trained by Bud Delp while racing for Polinger. She was bought by Diana Firestone following Polinger's death in 1976. Mrs. Firestone turned the mare over to trainer Leroy Jolley. She was named Maryland-bred horse of the year in 1977 and twice was named champion older mare. What A Summer was retired in 1878 and as a broodmare she produced several graded stakes winners.

CATEGORIES: Organic polymers, Personal armour, Synthetic fibers, Brand name materials

Kevlar KM2 is a synthetic para-aramid fibre produced by DuPont. The fiber is an evolution of the original Kevlar fibre. The following quotes summarise Kevlar KM2's properties. 
"DuPont created Kevlar KM2 to achieve the performance goals defined by casualty reduction testing for the Department of Defense. Today it is used extensively for fragmentation protection in the U.S. military. Helmets and vests made with Kevlar KM2 provide enhanced bullet and fragmentation resistance while remaining comfortable and breathable in the most inhospitable climates.
Excellent thermal stability at temperature extremes, water repellency, chemical stability and resistance to petroleum products have made Kevlar KM2 an indispensable asset to the military personnel who use it every day."http://www2.dupont.com/Kevlar/en_US/products/life_protection/kevlar_km2.html
"Kevlar KM2 fiber is a transversely isotropic material. Its tensile stress-strain response in the axial direction is linear and elastic until failure. However, the overall deformation in the transverse directions is nonlinear and nonelastic, although it can be treated linearly and elastically in infinitesimal strain range. For a linear, elastic, and transversely isotropic material, five material constants are needed to describe its stress-strain response. In this paper, stress-strain behavior obtained from experiments on a single Kevlar KM2 fiber are presented and discussed. The effects of loading rate and the influence of axial loading on transverse and transverse loading on axial stress-strain responses are also discussed."Mechanical Properties of Kevlar KM2 Single Fibre, J.

Virginia Rich (1914–1985) was a mystery author who pioneered the 'culinary mystery' sub genre. 
In three novels written 1982 to 1985 she introduced sleuth Eugenia Potter, a widow and chef who divided her time between a ranch in Arizona and a small town on the Maine coast. The books included recipes, the hallmark of what has come to be called 'culinary mysteries'. Several years after her death her family approached mystery writer Nancy J. Pickard to complete an unfinished manuscript, producing The 27 Ingredient Chili Con Carne Murders, published in 1993. Pickard went on to write two more novels in the series, based on Rich's notes.online article by Edie Dykeman
Rich was born in Sibley, Iowa. She wrote a food column for the Chicago Tribune under the name of Mary Meade, and served as food editor for Sunset Magazine. She was married to cattleman Ray Rich. Like her heroine, she lived on a working cattle ranch near Tucson, Arizona and spent a number of months a year at her cottage off the coast of Maine. Her daughter Susan Sheridan Rich is an art teacher.Fantastic Fiction author details/
Culinary mysteries are usually seen as a type of 'cozy':'Some Like it Mild' Publishers weekly article on coziesCozy mystery blog article on culinary mysteries escapist, enjoyable mysteries just right for reading by the fire. There are now several series of 'cozies' with sleuths who are cooks, caterers, food critics and so on, incorporating recipes, written by Jerrilyn Farmer, Diane Mott Davidson, Joanne Fluke, Nancy Fairbanks and others, as well as a wider pool of 'food themed' mysteries with settings in the food or wine businesses. However, one reviewer notes that Rich's books aren't quite as 'cozy' as the latest offerings, being the product of female experience in earlier decades and different literary influences.Linda G.

Constantin Alexandrovich Westchiloff (born Konstantin Alexandrovich Veschilov; 1877–1945) was a Russian-American Impressionist painter.
Westchiloff was born in Russia in 1877. He Americanized his name to Constantin A. Westchiloff when he emigrated to the United States in 1935.
He studied under Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg from 1898. He won an award in 1904 for the painting, "Ivan the Terrible After the Triumph of Kazan." He held a foreign study fellowship from the Royal Academy in 1905-06. He exhibited in the Royal Academy's Fall Exhibit of 1906, showing "Breakthrough of the Cruiser Askold in 1904 in the Yellow Sea," which documented the Russo-Japanese War. In that Academy exhibit he also showed portraits of Count Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky and of Lieut. S. Poguljajeff. He was also active in theatre design at the Petrograd Technical Institute.
He emigrated from Soviet Russia in 1922, lived in Italy (1923-1928), France (1929-1935), and immigrated to the United States in 1935 and settled in New York, where he died.
Throughout his career Westchiloff painted a wide variety of subjects in the Impressionist style, but was particularly noted for his seascapes and harbor scenes. He operated a studio in New York and often painted coastal Maine scenes. What may be his largest work, "Niagara Falls" at 57-inches wide by 48-inches high, appeared at auction in London in the early 1980s and is now in a private collection in Chicago.

The Williamson trade-off model is a theoretical model in the economics of industrial organization which emphasizes the trade-off associated with horizontal mergers between gains resulting from lower costs of production and the losses associated with higher prices due to greater degree of monopoly power.Robert Beynon, "The Routledge critical dictionary of global economics", Taylor & Francis, 1999, p. 349
The model was first presented by Oliver Williamson, co-laureate of the 2009 Nobel prize in economics,All Laureates in Economic Sciences, Nobelprize.org in his 1968 paper "Economics as an Anti-Trust Defense: The welfare trade-offs" in the American Economic Review.Williamson, Oliver, "Economics as an Anti-Trust Defense: The welfare trade-offs", The American Economic Review, Vol. 58, No. 1 (March 1968), pp. 18–36 Williamson argued that ignoring efficiencies that may result from proposed mergers in antitrust law "fail(ed) to meet the basic test of economic rationality".Katalin Judit Cseres, "Competition law and consumer protection", Kluwer Law International, 2005, p. 139

It is characterized by single or multiple small homogeneous, symmetrical lesions, most commonly located on the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg. The pain associated to these lesions is often disproportionate to their size.[tpl]cite journal|last=Davison|first=Steven|coauthors=Lee, Edward ; Newton, Edward D|title=Martorell's Ulcer Revisited|journal=Wounds|year=2003|volume=15|issue=6|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/457933|accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]  
The syndrome occurs predominantly in middle-aged women with poorly controlled hypertension in the form of skin ulcers on the anterolateral aspect of the lower legs. The lesions initially appear as small, painful blisters which may or may not be associated with trauma. The pathophysiology of the Martorell ulcer is assumed to be related to hypertension-induced arteriole changes in the dermis. The pain is often disproportionate, and the symptoms are not relieved by rest or elevation.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1097/AAP.0b013e31820308b2 |title=Use of a spinal Cord Stimulator for Treatment of Martorell Hypertensive Ulcer |year=2011 |last1=De Andrés |first1=José |last2=Villanueva |first2=Vicente L. |last3=Mazzinari |first3=Guido |last4=Fabregat |first4=Gustavo |last5=Asensio |first5=Juan Marcos |last6=Monsalve |first6=Vicente |journal=Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine |volume=36 |pages=83–6 |pmid=21455092 |issue=1[/tpl]

The human-rights situation in Benin is considered to be generally above average for sub-Saharan Africa.  
A 2012 U.S. report commended Benin “for continuing the transition to democracy” and applauded “the legislative work of recent years to pass and enforce laws regarding domestic violence against women, official corruption, torture, and other crimes,” as well as “the establishment of human rights institutions including the human rights Ombudsman and the National Council for the Promotion of Gender Equity and Equality.” 
The report expressed continued concern, however, “about continuing reports of high levels of violence and abuse by security services, including the police, as well as harsh prison conditions and long pre-trial detention periods,” as well as “by reports of serious restrictions on the right to strike in the public sector and authorities’ frequent anti-union statements, fueling social tensions and protest actions.”  In addition, the report noted “the government’s slow progress in addressing the worst forms of child labor.”[tpl]cite web|title=UPR 14th Session – Intervention for Benin|url=http://www.humanrights.gov/2012/10/25/upr-14th-session-intervention-for-benin/|work=Humanrights.gov|accessdate=January 11, 2013[/tpl]

The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto ("History of St Cuthbert") is a historical compilation finished some time after 1031. It is an account of the history of the bishopric of St Cuthbert—based successively at Lindisfarne, Norham, Chester-le-Street and finally Durham—from the life of St Cuthbert himself onwards. The latest event documented is a grant by King Cnut, c. 1031. The work is a cartulary chronicle recording grants and losses of property as well as miracles of retribution, under a loose narrative of temporal progression. The text survives in three manuscripts, the earliest of which dates from around 1100. The original version of the text is not thought to be extant; rather, all surviving manuscripts are thought to be copies of an earlier but lost exemplar. The Historia is one of the important sources behind the higher quality expanded histories produced at Durham in the early 12th century, particularly the Historia Regum and Symeon of Durham's Libellus de Exordio.

CATEGORIES: Houston Astros, Major League Baseball first-round draft picks

The Houston Astros, originally called the "Colt .45s", are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Houston, Texas. They play in the American League West division. Since the institution of Major League Baseball's Rule 4 Draft, the Astros have selected 56 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player Draft", the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, and the team that had the worst record receives the first pick.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/draftday/rules.jsp|title=First-Year Player Draft Rules|work=MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081126&content_id=3694740&vkey=news_mil&fext=.jsp&c_id=mil&partnerId=rss_mil|title=Brewers offer three arbitration|last=McCalvy|first=Adam|work=Brewers.MLB.com|publisher=Milwaukee Brewers|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1961 expansion draft in which the Astros initially filled their roster.
Of the 56 players picked in the first round by Houston, 24 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 21 of these were right-handed, while 3 were left-handed. Nine catchers were selected, while nine outfielders, nine shortstops, two first basemen, and two third basemen were taken as well. The team also selected one player at second base.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/?query_type=franch_round&team_ID=HOU&draft_round=1&draft_type=junreg|title=Baseball Draft: Houston Astros 1st Round Picks in the June Draft|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=December 9, 2009[/tpl] Thirteen of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, while Texas and Tennessee follow with five and three players, respectively. They have also drafted two players from outside the United States: Carlos Correa (2012) from Puerto Rico and Ramón Castro (1994) from Puerto Rico.
No Astros first-round pick has won a Rookie of the Year award, Most Valuable Player award, or Cy Young Award with the team. Craig Biggio (1987) is the only player drafted by the Astros in the first round in the 3000 hit club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/biggicr01.shtml|title=Craig Biggio Statistics and History|accessdate=January 10, 2010|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC[/tpl] Brad Lidge (1998) won the Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2008 with the Philadelphia Phillies, his first season after leaving the Astros.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lidgebr01.shtml|title=Brad Lidge Statistics and History|publisher=Sports Reference|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=January 11, 2009[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1278 deaths, People of the Ilkhanate, Heads of state of Iran, Mongol Empire people, Oirats, Year of birth unknown

Arghun Agha, also Arghun Aqa or Arghun the Elder (d. 1278) was a Mongol noble of the Oirat clan in the 13th century.  He was a governor in the Mongol-controlled area of Persia from 1243 to 1255, before the Ilkhanate was created by Hulagu.Grousset, p. 376  Arghun Agha was in control of the four districts of eastern and central Persia, as decreed by the great khan Möngke Khan.
When he was young, his father sold his son Arghun to Ilugei of the Jalayir, tutor of Ogedei Khan. During his years with the Ogedeyid family, he gained reputation among the members of the Royal blood because he was well educated. Arghun started his career as court official during the reign of the Qaghan Ogedei. Later on, the latter's consort, Toregene Khatun, appointed him civil governor in Transoxiana in c.1242. Ascelin of Lombardia might have met him while he was at the court of Baiju in c.1247. He is described as faithful servant of the Qaghan in Persian sources while the Georgian and Armenian sources say he was cruel and violent overseer. However, one Georgian chronicle mentions he was a friend of equity, trustful in his language, a deep thinker, and profound in counsel. It also says Arghun conducted the empire-wide census in Russia, Arctic, Alania, Pontic steppe, Georgia, Armenia and Anatolia.H.H.Howrth-HOM, Mongols in Persia, vol.III. p.68
Arghun had many political enemies at the headquarters, so he had to often visit the ordo (palace) of the Qaghan in Mongolia to prove his loyalty. Although, Mongke appointed him to his former position after his accession in 1252, the Emperor summoned Arghun to answer a charge of treason. The Armenian noble, Sempad the Constable, justified Arghun completely and charged his enemy a Khorazmi lieutenant with being the real offender.H.H.Howorth, HOM, Mongols in Persia, vol.III. p.65 Arghun was released and they returned together.
Arghun made a census in Persia in accordance with the decree of Mongke in 1254.
Arghun's son Nowruz was a powerful Mongol emir in his own right, an early convert to Islam, and persuaded Ghazan to convert in 1295 when he took the throne.

[[25th Virginia Infantry]]
CATEGORIES: Virginia Civil War regiments

The 25th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised in Virginia for service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought mostly with the Army of the Northwest and Army of Northern Virginia.  It's brave soldiers saw action from the first battle (Philippi) until the last (Appomattox).
The 25th Virginia was organized during the early summer of 1861. Its members were raised in Upshur, Augusta, Highland, Bath, Pendleton, and Rockbridge counties. The unit participated in Lee's Cheat Mountain Campaign and Jackson's Valley Campaign.  In the spring of 1862 the 9th Battalion, Virginia Infantry, four companies under the command of Lt. Colonel George W. Hansbrough that had served in the Army of the Northwest and fought at Greenbrier River and Camp Allegheny were merged into the 25th Virginia.  After the July 11, 1861 battle of Rich Mountain, the regiment was severely depleted due to Col. Pegram's surrender of Camp Garnett.  Members of 1st Co. A (Upshur Grays) and 1st Co. B (Rockbridge Guards) were dispatched to Hart's Farm under command of Capt. Julius A. DeLagnel to ward off an expected Federal assault.  Men of the 20th VA and 25th VA, along with a lone cannon took position in the stable yard of the Hart farm and awaited the Federal assault.  As the Federals appeared on the hillside, the long-awaited battle that the boys of Virginia had anticipated commenced.  The small (310 men) force of Confederates held back the initial attacks, but overwhelming numbers, along with a final charge of the 19th Ohio forced the surviving members of the Confederate outpost to flee.  The following morning, being cut off and surrounded, Col. Pegram surrendered the balance of his command at Camp Garnett, including the majority of the 25th VA.  The 25th lost 5 killed, 11 wounded, and 2 captured at Hart's farm.  Included in the dead were Upshur Gray privates Henry Clay Jackson and Oscar Sherwood, whose names can be seen engraved in the rock that they defended to this day.
After Jackson's campaign finished, the regiment was assigned to General Early's, J.R. Jones', and W.Terry's Brigade, Army of Northern Virginia. It took an active part in the campaigns of the army from the Seven Days' Battles to Cold Harbor, then fought with Early in the Shenandoah Valley and in various conflicts around Appomattox.
This regiment reported 18 casualties at Camp Alleghany, 72 at McDowell, and 29 at Cross Keys and Port Republic. It lost 1 killed and 24 wounded at Cedar Mountain, had 3 killed and 20 wounded at Sharpsburg, and reported 1 killed and 13 wounded at Fredericksburg. Of the 280 engaged at Gettysburg, twenty-five percent were disabled. There were 15 members (1 officer, 14 enlisted) of the 25th at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.(25th VA Inf. Richard Armstrong pg. 88)
The field officers were Colonels John C. Higginbotham, George A. Porterfield, and George H. Smith; Lieutenant Colonels Patrick B. Duffy, Jonathan McGee Heck, Robert D. Lilley, and John A. Robinson; and Majors Wilson Harper, Albert G. Reger, and William T. Thompson.

[[Powers of the President of Singapore]]
CATEGORIES: Presidents of Singapore

The powers of the President of Singapore are divided into those which the largely ceremonial President may exercise at his own discretion, and those he must exercise in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet of Singapore or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. In addition, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) when performing some of his functions. In other cases, he may consult the CPA if he wishes to but is not bound to do so.
In 1991 the Constitution of Singapore was amended to transform the office of President, which was previously indirectly elected by Parliament, into an office directly elected by the people. The amendment conferred on the President certain executive functions to block attempts by the government of the day to draw down past reserves that it did not accumulate. Thus, a guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, and his approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The President also possesses personal discretion to withhold assent to any bill in Parliament providing directly or indirectly for the direct or indirect variation, changing or increase in powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest moneys belonging to it; and the borrowing of money, the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if in the President's opinion the bill is likely to draw on reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office. In addition, the President may withhold assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if in his opinion the estimates of revenue and expenditure, supplementary estimates or statement of excess are likely to lead to a drawing on past reserves.
The President is also empowered to approve changes to key civil service positions, such as the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, the chairman and members of the Public Service Commission, the Chief of Defence Force and the Commissioner of Police. He also appoints as Prime Minister a Member of Parliament (MP) who, in his personal judgment, is likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. The President has certain powers of oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the Executive under the Internal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act.
The term of office of the first popularly elected President, Ong Teng Cheong (1993–1999), was marked by differences between him and the Government concerning the extent of his discretionary fiscal powers. Discussions culminated in the Government issuing a non-binding white paper entitled The Principles for Determining and Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies (1999). In 2009, the Government requested approval from President S. R. Nathan to draw S$4.9 billion from past financial reserves in order to meet current budget expenditure, the first time it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the financial downturn.
Whether the President may speak publicly on issues without the Government's approval was discussed heavily during the 2011 presidential election. While some candidates and members of the public suggested that the President has power to do so, the Law Minister, K. Shanmugam, stated that the President's ability to speak freely is limited to those matters that, according to the Constitution, he exercises discretionary powers over. He should not act as a political centre distinct from the Government. A difference of opinion also exists over whether the President exercises soft power.

After being involved in the Seven Days' Battles it was transferred to the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The unit participated in the defense of Charleston, then during the spring of 1864 returned to Virginia. Here it took its place in the Petersburg trenches and was active in various conflicts around Appomattox.  Many were captured at Sayler's Creek and on April 9, 1865, there were 15 officers and 81 men present.

[[Irrigation in viticulture]]
CATEGORIES: Irrigation, Viticulture, Wine terms

Irrigation in viticulture is the process of applying extra water in the cultivation of grapevines. It is considered both controversial and essential to wine production. In the physiology of the grapevine, the amount of available water affects photosynthesis and hence growth, as well as the development of grape berries. While climate and humidity play important roles, a typical grape vine needs 25-35 inches (635-890 millimeters) of water a year, occurring during the spring and summer months of the growing season, to avoid stress.T. Stevenson "The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia" p. 15 Dorling Kindersley 2005 ISBN 0-7566-1324-8 A vine that does not receive the necessary amount of water will have its growth altered in a number of ways; some effects of water stress (particularly, smaller berry size and somewhat higher sugar content) are considered desirable by wine grape growers.
In many Old World wine regions, natural rainfall is considered the only source for water that will still allow the vineyard to maintain its terroir characteristics. The practice of irrigation is viewed by some critics as unduly manipulative with the potential for detrimental wine quality due to high yields that can be artificially increased with irrigation.J. Robinson (ed) "The Oxford Companion to Wine" Third Edition pp. 236-263, 361-362, 507-566, 635-641, 709-763 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0-19-860990-6 It has been historically banned by the European Union's wine laws, though in recent years individual countries (such as Spain) have been loosening their regulations and France's wine governing body, the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO), has also been reviewing the issue.R. Joseph & J. Payne "Yves Benard: The new broom at the INAO" Meininger's Wine Business International, August 24, 2007
In very dry climates that receive little rainfall, irrigation is considered essential to any viticultural prospects. Many New World wine regions such as Australia and California regularly practice irrigation in areas that couldn't otherwise support viticulture. Advances and research in these wine regions (as well as some Old World wine regions such as Israel), have shown that potential wine quality could increase in areas where irrigation is kept to a minimum and managed. The main principle behind this is controlled water stress, where the vine receives sufficient water during the budding and flowering period, but irrigation is then scaled back during the ripening period so that the vine then responds by funneling more of its limited resources into developing the grape clusters instead of excess foliage. If the vine receives too much water stress, then photosynthesis and other important processes such as nutrient storage could be impacted with the vine essentially shutting down. The availability of irrigation means that if drought conditions emerge, sufficient water can be provided for the plant so that the balance between water stress and development is kept to optimal levels.

Pro Egg|ハロプロエッグ|Haro Puro Eggu|also abbreviated as [tpl]Nihongo|Egg|エッグ|Eggu[/tpl][/tpl] are a group of female singers under the Hello! Project (commonly shortened to "Hello Pro") banner. They are girls chosen when Tsunku and other audition administrators see talent in them that can be developed further, in the hope of one day turning them into successful musicians, and possibly integrating them into other Hello! Project groups. As an example, in 2011, Hello Pro Egg member Mizuki Fukumura joined Morning Musume.
The first official Hello! Pro Egg audition was held in 2004, with subsequent auditions held in 2006 and 2007. The first "generation" of Eggs were chosen from the 2004 auditions, with a total of 30 girls passing the audition. These auditions were initially only for girls from elementary school age to 18 years old, but in recent years have allowed girls as old as 25.[tpl]Wayback|url=http://morningmusume.dream.com/news/04_audition/index.html|title=Hello!

[[Colitis-X]]
CATEGORIES: Horse diseases

Colitis X, equine colitis X or peracute toxemic colitis is a catchall term for various fatal forms of acute or peracute colitis found in horses, but particularly a fulminant colitis where clinical signs include sudden onset of severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, shock, and dehydration. Death is common, with 90% to 100% mortality, usually in less than 24 hours. The causative factor may be Clostridium difficile, but it also may be caused by other intestinal pathogens. Horses under stress appear to be more susceptible to developing colitis X, and like the condition pseudomembranous colitis in humans, there also is an association with prior antibiotic use. Immediate and aggressive treatment can sometimes save the horse, but even in such cases, 75% mortality is considered a best-case scenario.

The 29th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment raised in Virginia for service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It fought mostly in western Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia.
The 29th Virginia was authorized in November, 1861, and was to contain seven companies under Colonel A.C. Moore and three companies at Pound Gap. However, this organization never took place.

It was assigned to the Valley District, Department of Northern Virginia, then moved to Kentucky where it was engaged at Middle Creek. Later it saw action in Western Virginia and for a time served in North Carolina under General French.
In March, 1863, it totalled 732 men. Attached to General Corse's Brigade the unit participated in Longstreet's Suffolk Expedition and during the Gettysburg Campaign was on detached duty in Tennessee and North Carolina. In the spring of 1864 it returned to Virginia and took its place in the Petersburg trenches north and south of the James River and ended the war at Appomattox. Many were lost at Sayler's Creek, and only 1 officer and 27 men surrendered on April 9, 1865.
The field officers were Colonels James Giles and Alfred C. Moore; Lieutenant Colonels Alexander Haynes, William Leigh, and Edwin R. Smith; and Majors Ebenezer Bruster, William R.B. Horne, and Isaac White.

Caecina was the name of an Etruscan family of Volaterrae, one of the ancient cities of Etruria.  Persons of this gens are first mentioned in the 1st century BC.  Under the Empire the name is of frequent occurrence.  As late as the reign of Honorius, we read of the poet Decius Albinus Caecina, residing at his villa in the neighborhood of Volaterrae; and until modern times there has been a family of this name at the modern Volterra.  The family tomb of the Caecinae has been discovered in the neighborhood of Volterra; in this tomb there was found a beautiful sarcophagus, now in the Museum of Paris.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor.

Henry Fowles Pringle (August 23, 1897 – April 7, 1958) was an American biographer and journalist. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his 1931 biography of Theodore Roosevelt.
Pringle was born in New York City. He served in the army during World War I and graduated from Cornell University.  He became a reporter for the New York Sun, New York Globe, and New York World.  He won notice for his biographical articles, written in a muckraking style.  This led to his first book, a 1927 campaign biography of New York Governor and presidential aspirant Al Smith.  In 1931, he published Theodore Roosevelt, a Biography, which attempted to debunk some of the former president's more colorful accounts of his own life. The biography provided a detailed portrait of Roosevelt's political career and also his personality. Pringle made full use of the Roosevelt presidential papers on deposit in the Library of Congress, and was clever enough to conceal the fact that he knew little about the final decade of his subject's life.
[tpl]cite book|last=Morris|first=Edmund|title=Colonel Roosevelt|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=NYC,NY|isbn=978-0-375-75707-5|page=564[/tpl]  
Pringle published a more sympathetic two-volume biography of William Howard Taft in 1939.
After teaching as a professor at the Columbia School of Journalism from 1932 to 1942, Pringle moved to Washington during World War II to head the publications division of the United States Office of War Information.  In his later years he wrote magazine articles and book reviews.  Pringle was married twice, to Helena Huntington Smith and to Katherine Douglas, and had two children.  He died in Washington on April 7, 1958.  At the time of his death, he was working on a joint biography of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, but the unfinished manuscript was never published.  His papers are in the Library of Congress.

During World War II, Barrière joined the French Resistance and operated in Aude. Whilst in the resistance, he met French leaders of rugby league which had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy government.
After the war, Barrière, along with Marcel Laborde who served as president of the French Rugby League between 1944 and 1947, worked to re-establish rugby league, which had been severely disrupted. Barrière became vice-president of the French Rugby League on 16 September 1944 at the Hotel Regina in Toulouse. He was elected president on 2 July 1947 at a meeting in Bayonne. Barrière was the driving force behind the agreement to create the International Rugby League Board and to institute a World Cup. When asked for this opinion on moves to name the World Cup trophy after him, Barrière refused the honour.
Under Barrière, the French national team undertook its first tour of the southern hemisphere.
From 1990 until 2004 Barrière organised the Festival de la Cite in Carcassonne for musical theatre.
In 2008, Barrière was posthumously awarded the inaugural RLIF Spirit of Rugby League Award which was created to honour those deemed to have made a significant contribution to the sport during their lifetime.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/john-ledgers-world-cup-diary/World-Cup-finalists-united-in.4707705.jp |title=World Cup finalists united in effort to raise spirits |last=Ledger |first=John |date=19 November 2008 |publisher=Yorkshire Post |accessdate=11 January 2010 |location=Yorkshire[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/kangaroos/article.php?id=1355 |title=Hayne named International Player of the Year |year=2009 |publisher=Australian Rugby League |accessdate=11 January 2010[/tpl]

Neelakesi (lit. The blue haired one) tells the story of the female jain monk (a jain version of the demoness Palayanur Neeli of Tamil folklore) of the same name, who was a rival preacher of the Buddhist protagonist of Kundalakesi. According the epic, when animal sacrifices of a temple of the Goddess Kali in Panchala are stopped due to the influence of Jains, the Goddess despatches the local deity/demoness Neeli to seduce and destroy the Jain monk responsible for it. However Neeli herself is converted to Jainism by the monk. Neelakesi as she is renamed, travels the country indulging in philosophical debate with rhetoricians of other religions. She debates and defeats several Buddhist rhetoricians like Arkachandra, Mokkala, Kundalakesi, Moggallana and even Buddha himself. Neelakesi also defeats votaries from other schools of philosophy including Samkhya, Vaisheshika, Mimāṃsā and Lokayitaka. The story of the epic mainly serves as a framework to present these debates and extol the tenets of Jainism.[tpl]Cite book| title=Indian Kāvya Literature: The bold style (Śaktibhadra to Dhanapāla)| last=Warder| first=Anthony Kennedy| year=1988| pages=670| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LgBzfaARMNoC&pg=PA670|id = ISBN 81-208-0450-3, ISBN 978-81-208-0450-0[/tpl]
