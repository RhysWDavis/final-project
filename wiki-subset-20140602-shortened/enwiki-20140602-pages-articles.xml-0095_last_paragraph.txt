[tpl]About|the bird family Paradisaeidae||Bird of paradise (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Bird of paradise[/tpl]

The birds-of-paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. The majority of species are found in New Guinea and its satellites, with a few in the Maluku Islands and eastern Australia. The family has forty-one species in 14 genera.Gill, F & D Donsker (Eds). 2012. IOC World Bird Names (v 3.2). Available at http://www.worldbirdnames.org 13 Jan 2013. The members of this family are perhaps best known for the plumage of the males of the sexually dimorphic species (the majority), in particular the highly elongated and elaborate feathers extending from the beak, wings, tail or head. For the most part they are confined to dense rainforest habitat. The diet of all species is dominated by fruit and to a lesser extent arthropods. The birds-of-paradise have a variety of breeding systems, ranging from monogamy to lek-type polygamy.
The family is of cultural importance to the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea. The trade in skins and feathers of the birds-of-paradise has been going on for two thousand years. The birds have also been of considerable interest to Western collectors, ornithologists and writers. A number of species are threatened by hunting and habitat loss.''

[[Two-source hypothesis]]
CATEGORIES: Synoptic problem, Biblical criticism, Christian terms, Gospel of Mark, Gospel of Matthew

The Two-source hypothesis (or 2SH) is an explanation for the synoptic problem, the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It posits that the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke were based on the Gospel of Mark and a hypothetical sayings collection from the Christian Oral Tradition called Q.
The two-source hypothesis emerged in the 19th century. B. H. Streeter definitively stated the case in 1924, adding that two other sources, referred to as M and L, lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively. The strengths of the hypothesis are its explanatory power regarding the shared and non-shared material in the three gospels; its weaknesses lie in the exceptions to those patterns, and in the hypothetical nature of its proposed collection of Jesus-sayings. Later scholars have advanced numerous elaborations and variations on the basic hypothesis, and even completely alternative hypotheses. Nevertheless, "the 2SH commands the support of most biblical critics from all continents and denominations.""The Two-Source Hypothesis", Mindspring.com
When Streeter's two additional sources, M and L, are taken into account, this hypothesis is sometimes referred to as the Four Document Hypothesis.

[[History of OS X]]
CATEGORIES: OS X, History of software

OS X is the newest of Apple Inc.'s Mac OS line of operating systems. Although, under its original name of Mac OS X, it was officially designated as simply "version 10" of the Mac OS, "version 9" had a completely different codebase as well as dramatic changes in user interface. Mac OS had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984, and the family was backward compatible, so OS X could virtualize Mac OS 9 until version 10.5.
Unlike its predecessor, OS X is a Unix operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997. It was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, with a desktop-oriented version (Mac OS X v10.0) following in March 2001. Since then, six more distinct "client" and "server" editions of Mac OS X were released, thereafter starting with Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, OS X Server is no longer offered as a separate operating system product; instead, the server management tools are available for purchase separately. The most recent version OS X 10.9 Mavericks was first made available on October 22, 2013.
Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard, when running on Intel processors,[tpl]cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard on Intel-based Macintosh computers certification|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3555.htm|accessdate=2007-06-12[/tpl] Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard,[tpl]cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Mac OS X Version 10.6 Leopard on Intel-based Macintosh computers certification|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3581.htm|accessdate=2013-07-11[/tpl] and OS X v10.8 Mountain Lion[tpl]cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Mac OS X Version 10.8 Mountain Lion on Intel-based Macintosh computers certification|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3591.htm|accessdate=2013-07-11[/tpl] are all certified Unix systems, conforming to the Single UNIX Specification.
Releases of OS X prior to 10.9 were named after big cats; the previous version of OS X, 10.8, is named Mountain Lion.  At the 2013 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple indicated that OS X 10.9 Mavericks and future OS X releases would be named after California locations.

[[Japanese beetle]]
CATEGORIES: Scarabaeidae, Agricultural pest insects, Insect pests of ornamental plants, Beetles of Asia, Animals described in 1841

The beetle species Popillia japonica is commonly known as the Japanese beetle. It is about [tpl]convert|15|mm|1[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|10|mm|1[/tpl] wide, with iridescent copper-colored elytra and green thorax and head.  It is not very destructive in Japan, where it is controlled by natural predators, but in America it is a serious pest of about 200 species of plants, including rose bushes, grapes, hops, canna, crape myrtles, birch trees, linden trees and others.  
It is a clumsy flier, dropping several centimeters when it hits a wall. Japanese beetle traps therefore consist of a pair of crossed walls with a bag or plastic container underneath, and are baited with floral scent, pheromone, or both. However, studies conducted at the University of Kentucky and Eastern Illinois University suggest beetles attracted to traps frequently do not end up in the traps, but alight on plants in the vicinity, thus causing more damage along the flight path of the beetles and near the trap than may have occurred if the trap were not present.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef409.asp |publisher=University of Kentucky |title=Managing Japanese Beetles[/tpl]  [tpl]cite web |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.0311 |publisher=Journal of Economic Entomology |title=Behavioral Explanations Underlying the Lack of Trap Effectiveness for Small-Scale Management of Japanese Beetles. [/tpl]  
These insects damage plants by skeletonizing the foliage, that is, consuming only the leaf material between the veins, and may also feed on fruit on the plants if present.

Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs  and nutcrackers. The common English names used are corvids (more technically) or the crow family (more informally), and there are over 120 species.

They are medium to large in size, with strong feet and bills, rictal bristles and a single moult each year (most passerines moult twice). Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps. The majority of the species is found in tropical South and Central America, southern Asia and Eurasia, with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia. The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory, with five species and one subspecies there.

[[Polynesian languages]]
CATEGORIES: Polynesian languages

The Polynesian languages are a language family spoken in geographical Polynesia as well as on a patchwork of "Outliers" from south central Micronesia, to small islands off the northeast of the larger islands of the Southeast Solomon Islands and sprinkled through Vanuatu. They are classified as part of the Austronesian family, belonging to the Oceanic branch of that family.  Polynesians share many unique cultural traits which resulted from about 1000 years of common development, including common linguistic development, in the Tonga and Sāmoa area through most of the first millennium BC.
There are approximately forty Polynesian languages. The most prominent of these are Tahitian, Sāmoan, Tongan, Māori and Hawai'ian. Because the Polynesian islands were settled relatively recently and because internal linguistic diversification only began around 2,000 years ago, their languages retain strong commonalities.  There are still many cognate words across the different islands e.g. tapu, ali'i, motu, kava (Kava culture), and tapa as well as Hawaiki, the mythical homeland for some of the cultures.  
All Polynesian languages show strong similarity, particularly in vocabulary. The vowels are often stable in the descendant languages, nearly always a, e, i, o and u. The legendary homeland of the Māori of New Zealand, where w is used instead of v, is called Hawaiki; in the Cook Islands, where h is replaced with the glottal stop, it is ‘Avaiki; in the Hawai'ian Islands, where w is used and k is replaced with the glottal stop, the largest island of the group is named Hawai‘i; in Sāmoa, where s has not been replaced by h, v is used instead of w, and k is replaced with the glottal stop, the largest island is called Savai'i. In the Society Islands, k and ng are replaced by the glottal stop, so the name for the ancestral homeland is pronounced Havai‘i.[tpl]cite book |title=Vikings of the Sunrise |last=Hiroa |first=Te Rangi |year=1964 |publisher=Whitecombe and Tombs Ltd |location=New Zealand|page=69 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucViki-t1-front-d1-d1.html |accessdate=21 August 2010 |isbn=0-313-24522-3[/tpl]

[[Tactical frivolity]]

CATEGORIES: Culture jamming techniques, Feminist protests, Feminism and the arts, Protest tactics

Tactical frivolity is a form of public protest involving  humour; often including  peaceful non-compliance with authorities,  carnival and whimsical antics.  Humour has played a role in political protests at least as far back as the Classical period in ancient Greece.  Yet it is only since the 1990s that the term  tactical frivolity has gained common currency for describing the use of humour in opposing perceived political injustice. Generally the term is used to denote a whimsical, non confrontational approach rather than aggressive mocking or cutting jokes.

[[Guerrilla communication]]
CATEGORIES: Culture jamming techniques, Underground culture

Guerrilla communication and communication guerrilla refer to an attempt to provoke subversive effects through interventions in the process of communication.
It can be distinguished from other classes of political action because it is not based on the critique of the dominant discourses but in the interpretation of the signs in a different way. Its main goal is to make a critical non-questioning of the existing,[tpl]clarify|date=April 2013[/tpl] for reasons ranging from political activism to marketing. In terms of marketing, journalist Warren Berger explains unconventional guerrilla-style advertising as "something that lurks all around, hits us where we live, and invariably takes us by surprise". These premises apply to the entire spectrum of guerrilla communication because each tactic intends to disrupt cognitive schemas and thought processing.
The term was created in 1997 by Luther Blissett and Sonja Brünzels, with the publication of Kommunication Guerrilla Handbook (originally in German, translated in 2001 to Spanish and Italian). Both pertain to autonome a.f.r.i.k.a gruppe, which includes many people involved in communication guerrillas such as activists and non-artists living in different German peripheries. However, it was used before in 1984 by Jay Conrad Levinson, as a marketing strategy for small businesses.Jay Conrad Levinson (1984): Guerrilla marketing: Secrets for making big profits from your small business, Houghton Mifflin, Boston.

In the Early Middle Ages the title became attached to courts beyond the imperial one; the highest level of officials in the Roman Catholic Church were called the judices palatini. Later the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties had counts palatine, as did the Holy Roman Empire. Related titles were used in Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, the German Empire, and the Duchy of Burgundy, while England, Ireland, and parts of British North America referred to rulers of counties palatine as palatines.

Assisted suicide is suicide committed by someone with assistance from others, typically to end suffering from a severe physical illness.http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assisted%20suicide It is often confused with euthanasia (sometimes called "mercy killing").  Euthanasia is the killing of another in order to relieve dire suffering, whereas assisted suicide is a practice in which an individual provides a competent patient with assistance, but where the individual brings about their own death, such as when a physician provides a prescription for a lethal dose of medication, upon the patient's request, which the patient intends to use to end his or her own life.http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pad.html
Discussion of assisted suicide centers on legal, religious, and moral conceptions of suicide and a personal "right to die". Legally speaking, the practice may be legal, illegal, or undecided, depending on the culture or jurisdiction.

[[Apprenticeship]]
CATEGORIES: Apprenticeship, Beginners and newcomers

Apprenticeship is a system of training a new generation of practitioners of a structured competency a basic set of skills. Apprentices are set a strict training program so they can gain a set of skills to prepare themselves for their desired trade or certain career in which they wish to pursue. License to practice in a regulated profession. Apprentices (Male learners) and Apprentesses (Female learners) (or in early modern usage "prentices") or protégés build their careers from apprenticeships. Most of their training is done while working for an employer who helps the apprentices learn their trade or profession, in exchange for their continuing labor for an agreed period after they have achieved measurable competencies. For more advanced apprenticeships, theoretical education was also involved, with jobs and farming over a period of 4–6 years.
In practically every skilled occupation, more than fundamental knowledge of arithmetic is essential. The ability to read, write and speak well is, while of course beneficial in any walk of life, in some apprenticeship occupations more important than in others.Schultz & Schultz, Duane (2010).

ISBN 0521668131, (p. 94)[/ref] (where she was one of the first students), she served as a Red Cross nurse during World War I with a voluntary Franco-American hospital. Broster's first two novels were
co-written with Gertrude Winifred Taylor; Chantemerle: A Romance of the Vendean War and The Vision Splendid
(about the Tractarian Movement).
Following the war she returned to Oxford where she worked as a secretary to the Regius Professor of History and senior civil servants.  She produced her best-seller about
Scottish history,  The Flight of the Heron, in 1925. Broster stated she had consulted
eighty reference books before beginning the novel.[ref]Diana Wallace,

She wrote several other historical novels, successful and much reprinted in their day, although this Jacobite Trilogy, featuring the dashing hero Ewen Cameron, remain the best known.  The Flight of the Heron has been made into a TV serial twice: by Scottish Television in eight episodes in 1968, and by the BBC in 1976.
The poet Patricia Beer was an admirer of Broster's novels, stating she had been fascinated by The Flight of the Heron when she read it aged thirteen.
Broster also wrote several short horror stories, collected in "A Fire of Driftwood" and 
Couching at the Door.Mike Ashley , Who's Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction.  Elm Tree Books, 1977. ISBN 0-241-89528-6. (p.44)

tales include "Clairvoyance", about a psychic girl, (1932), and "Juggernaut" (1935) about a 
haunted chair.Jack Adrian, "Broster, D(orothy) K(athleen)", in David Pringle, ed., St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998. (pp. 95-97) ISBN 1558622063 Jack Adrian describes
Couching at the Door as  "a pure masterwork, one of the most satisfying weird collections of the century".

CATEGORIES: British television soap operas, BBC television dramas, 1960s British television series, 1965 British television programme debuts, 1969 British television programme endings

The Newcomers was a late 1960s BBC soap opera which dealt with the subject of a London family, the Coopers, who moved to a housing estate in the fictional country town of Angleton. It was broadcast in bi-weekly half hour episodes from 5 October 1965 until 28 November 1969. It was initially produced by Verity Lambert.
In the series, a fictional light industrial manufacturing company called Eden Brothers decides to relocate to the rural location.  There are conflicts with the older members of the existing community, as well as some lighter moments as urbanites encounter "country characters".  Many of the relocated workers have trouble living outside the city.  As the series progresses, problems on the factory floor spill over into the community.  Throughout this the Coopers strive to raise their daughter and two sons, who are having their own issues.
The show was recorded principally in the BBC's West London studios, mainly Riverside 1, and also at BBC Birmingham Studios, with external scenes filmed in Haverhill, a town in South-west Suffolk, which itself expanded rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s through residents moving from London.  The cast included several actors who later achieved wider fame, including Alan Browning (later seen in Coronation Street), Maggie Fitzgibbon, Judy Geeson, Jenny Agutter and Wendy Richard.  The theme music was composed by John Barry. In two episodes the group Jimmy Powell and the Five Dimensions were featured and appeared at the pub. (They were billed as "the New Dimensions")They performed their new Decca 45 'I Just Can't Get Over You'
The Cooper and Harker families were the initial focus of the series.  The on-screen sudden death of the character of Ellis Cooper led to a gradual shift away from the Coopers, who by the end of the serial barely featured.
A change of the managing director of Eden Bros heralded the arrival of his daughter Kirsty, played by Jennifer Agutter, but only during her school holidays.

Kenneth "Ken" Barlow is a long-standing fictional character from the ITV soap opera Coronation Street, played by William Roache. Ken was created by Tony Warren as one of Coronation Street's original characters. He debuted in the soap's first episode on 9 December 1960.[tpl]cite web|title=Corrie's Bill will mark half century|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=Metro|publisher=(Associated Newspapers)|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=7 November 2008[/tpl] Having appeared continuously since the programme's inception, December 2010 marked Ken's 50th anniversary on-screen. At this time, Roache officially became the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera. Roache was honoured at the 2010 Guinness World Records ceremony for the achievement, when he surpassed actor Don Hastings from the American soap opera As the World Turns, who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he has no plans to leave the role and will remain in Coronation Street for as long as they will have him.
Ken was introduced as the educated 21-year-old son of a working-class family. Portrayed as moralistic and a political activist, Ken differed from the other, predominantly working-class characters in the soap opera. The character developed a reputation as a ladies' man; plots saw Ken dating numerous women, marrying four times to three women (Valerie Tatlock in 1962, Janet Reid in 1972 and Deirdre Langton in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children (Lawrence Cunningham, Susan Barlow, Peter Barlow and Daniel Osbourne), and adopting one daughter (Tracy Barlow).[tpl]cite web|last=Moss|first=John|title=Coronation Street, Granada Television, Manchester|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=Manchester UK|accessdate=29 April 2011|year=2002[/tpl] Of the many women Ken has been paired with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring; they married in 1981 and divorced a decade later, only to re-marry in 2005. Ken and Deirdre's fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983 due to Deirdre's adultery with Mike Baldwin. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest. 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken's discovery of the affair. The storyline lead to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters' narratives until Mike Baldwin was killed off in 2006.
Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show's early years, Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal "boring man". This is an allegation denied by Roache, who has cited Ken's evolution over the years, his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary. Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken. Away from the canonical serial, Ken has been portrayed by James Roache (William Roache's son) in the dramatisation The Road to Coronation Street, and by Simon Chadwick in the play Corrie!. He has also been spoofed by impressionist Jon Culshaw.
On 1 May 2013, William Roache was arrested and charged with two counts of rape.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a478066/coronation-streets-bill-roache-charged-with-two-counts-of-rape.html The character was written out of the soap until further notice with the last appearance being 29 April 2013.

[[Third gender]]
CATEGORIES: Third gender, Gender studies, Intersex

The terms third gender and third sex describe individuals who are categorized (by their will or by social consensus) as neither man nor woman, as well as the social category present in those societies who recognize three or more genders. The term "third" is usually understood to mean "other"; some anthropologists and sociologists have described fourth,Roscoe, Will (2000). Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America. Palgrave Macmillan (June 17, 2000) ISBN 0-312-22479-6 See also: Trumbach, Randolph (1994).

The concepts of "third", "fourth" and "some" genders can be somewhat difficult to understand within Western conceptual categories.McGee, R. Jon and Richard L. Warms 2011 Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. New York, McGraw Hill.
Although biology usually determines genetically whether a human's biological sex is male or female (though intersex people are also born), the state of personally identifying as, or being identified by society as, belonging to neither the male or female genders is considered relative to the individual's gender role in society, gender identity, and sexual orientation. While some western scholars have sought to understand the term 'third gender' in terms of 'sexual orientation,' several other scholars, especially the native non-western scholars, consider this as a misrepresentation of 'third genders.'Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist ScripturesANCESTORS OF TWO-SPIRITS: REPRESENTATIONS OF NATIVE AMERICAN THIRD-GENDER MALES To different cultures or individuals, a third gender may represent an intermediate state between man and woman, a state of being both (such as "the spirit of a man in the body of a woman"), the state of being neither (neuter), the ability to cross or swap genders, another category altogether independent of men and women. This last definition is favored by those who argue for a strict interpretation of the "third gender" concept. In any case, all of these characterizations are defining gender and not the sex that biology gives to living beings.
The term has been used to describe hijras of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan[ref][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1177/006996697031002005 | title = Gendered Bodies: The Case of the 'Third Gender' in India | year = 1997 | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = A. | journal = Contributions to Indian Sociology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 273–297 [/tpl]

Like the hijra, the third gender is in many cultures made up of individuals considered male at the time of birth who take on a feminine gender role or sexual role. In cultures that have not taken on Western heteronormativity, they are usually seen as acceptable sexual partners for male-identifying individuals as long as the latter always maintain the "active" role.

Having attended a Church of England ordination conference at Bangalore during his service in India, he took up scholarship to enter Queen's College, Oxford where he graduated as MA in 1954.

At time of his consecration he had been a lecturer in theology at the University of Oxford, Chaplain and Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford and worked for the World Council of Churches and the William Temple Foundation before being appointed Professor of Theology at the University of Leeds in 1979.  Jenkins left Leeds in 1984 with the title Emeritus Professor.University of Leeds, List of Emeritus Professors
In addition to his teaching appointments Jenkins had been Examining Chaplain to the Bishops of Lichfield (1956–69), Newcastle upon Tyne (1957–69), Bristol (1958–84), Wakefield (1978-84) and Bradford (1979–84).
He has written numerous books on Christian theology which include:
He has also given Bampton Lectures on the Incarnation at Oxford.Biography on Biography.com
His selection as Bishop of Durham was controversial due to allegations that he held heterodox beliefs. His "conjuring trick with bones" comment, about the resurrection of Christ, was criticised[tpl]who|date=November 2011[/tpl] in particular, though the actual words as recorded on television say the reverse; the resurrection is NOT a conjuring trick with bones. The original line appears to have been "Resurrection is real. That's the point. All I said was 'literally physical'. I was very careful in the use of language. After all, a conjuring trick with bones proves only that somebody's very clever at a conjuring trick with bones." Independent,  "Profile: The one true Bishop of Durham: Dr David Jenkins, retiring scourge of sacred cows", accessed November 21, 2010. He had stated on other occasions his view that the resurrected Christ lacked a physical body, but the paraphrase of his quote as "just a conjuring trick with bones", while common, is unfair. 
Three days after his consecration as bishop on 6 July 1984, York Minster was struck by lightning, resulting in a disastrous fire which some interpreted as a sign of divine wrath at Jenkins's appointment.The Times, 27 August 2006 
As a bishop, Jenkins was known for his willingness to speak his mind. After leaving office in 1994 he continued to voice his opinions, such as in a BBC interview in 2003.BBC Breakfast with Frost Interview, 2 February 2003 In 2005, he became one of the first clerics in the Church of England to participate to the public blessing of a civil partnership between two homosexual men, one of whom was a priest of the Church of England.
Jenkins also became identified with opposition to the policies of the Thatcher and Major governments and subsequently was a critic of New Labour. He argued that what these governments shared was a dogmatic faith on the market which had many pseudo-religious elements to it. This led him to write at length about what he saw as the intellectual deficiencies of economic theory and market theorising and its pseudo-theological character. His Market whys and human wherefores : thinking again about markets, politics and people London : Cassell, c2000 was an extended layman’s critique of  economic theory and its application to policy. Jenkins described himself as an ‘anxious idiot’ using the latter term in its original meaning of an ordinary person with no professional expertise. His book nevertheless diagnosed many of the problems with economic theory and its application to a deregulated economy that would later be seen as prescient in the light of the global economic crisis of 2007 onwards. He also challenged the idea that markets created freedom in Dilemmas of freedom, University of Southampton, 1989 and that they were compatible with the idea of a university  Price, cost, excellence and worth : can the idea of a university survive the force of the market?

In 2006, Jenkins was banned from preaching in some of his local churches after reportedly "swearing" in a sermon. (The words used were "bloody" and "damn".) In 2002 he published The calling of a cuckoo : not quite an autobiography  London : Continuum, 2002.

[[Ut queant laxis]]

CATEGORIES: Christian hymns

Ut queant laxis or Hymnus in Ioannem are verses in honour of John the Baptist written in Horatian Sapphics by Paulus Diaconus, the eighth century Lombard historian. The first syllable of each hemistich (half line of verse) has given its name to a successive note. The use of Ut queant laxis to name the tones is usually attributed to Guido of Arezzo in the eleventh century, who proposed a name for the first six tones. Later, the "si" was added in the 18th century.
The musical origins of the hymn are less clear, but the melody shares a common ancestor with the eleventh-century arrangement of Horace's Ode to Phyllis (4.11) recorded in the Montpellier manuscript H425. In this melody, each of the first six musical phrases of each stanza of the hymn begins on a successively higher note of the hexachord, corresponding to the tone proposed by Guido of Arezzo, except the last line, Sancte Iohannes, which is an adonius after the three Sapphic hendecasyllables, breaking the ascending pattern. It is possible that the music was created by Guido of Arezzo himself or is just a re-use of a former melody.[tpl]fr[/tpl]Ut queant laxis in Encyclopédie Larousse
In the Roman rite, the hymn is sung in the Divine Office on June 24, the Feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist. The full hymn is divided into three parts, with Ut queant laxis sung at Vespers, Antra deserti sung at Matins, O nimis felix sung at Lauds, and doxologies added after the first two parts.
The first stanza is:
It may be translated: So that your servants may, with loosened voices, resound the wonders of your deeds, clean the guilt from our stained lips, O Saint John.
Ut is now mostly replaced by Do in solfège due to the latter's open sound, in deference to Italian theorist Giovanni Battista Doni. The word "Ut" is still in use to name the C-clé. The seventh note was not part of the medieval hexachord and does not occur in this melody, and it was originally called "si" from "Sancte Ioannes".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] In the nineteenth century, Sarah Glover, an English music teacher, renamed "si" to "ti" so that every syllable might be notated by its initial letter. But this was not adopted in countries using fixed-do systems: in Romance languages "si" is used alike for B and B flat, and no separate syllable is required for sharp "sol".

Heteronormativity is the body of lifestyle norms that holds that people fall into distinct and complementary genders (man and woman) with natural roles in life. It asserts that heterosexuality is the only sexual orientation or only norm, and states that sexual and marital relations are most (or only) fitting between people of opposite sexes. Consequently, a "heteronormative" view is one that involves alignment of biological sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. Heteronormativity is often linked to heterosexism and homophobia.Lovaas, Karen, and Mercilee M. Jenkins. "Charting a Path through the 'Desert of Nothing.'"

[[Singing]]
CATEGORIES: Occupations in music, Singing

Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of both tonality and rhythm. One who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung either with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in a group of other musicians, such as in a choir of singers with different voice ranges, or in an ensemble with instrumentalists, such as a rock group or baroque ensemble.
In many respects human song is a form of sustained speech, nearly anyone able to speak can also sing. Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done for pleasure, comfort, ritual, education, or profit. Excellence in singing may require time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds are said to be more clear and strong. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock. They typically take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.

Fatemeh is Fatemeh ([tpl]lang-fa|فاطمه، فاطمه است[/tpl]) is a book written by Ali Shariati. In the book, Fatima Zahra the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad is described as a role model for Muslim women around the world. It was written in the pre-revolutionary era of Iran's history where there were no specific sources by which one might interpret who she was, and he assures the readers that he is giving them more than an analytical description of her personality and that it needs the criticism of the enlightened thinker. By writing this book he was to complete the work of French scholar Professor Louis Massignon.
He describes Fatima as a manifestation and a symbol of the way and an essential direction of 'Islamic thought'. He states that even in the ever changing world in which people's views towards life constantly change, as a role model Fatima can still be looked up to by women around the world.

[tpl]quotation|... gioco al coplotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al detournement – inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk – che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, Malcom McClaren, a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scateno', con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece e' stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale mainstream.[/tpl][/ref] and inspired the culture jamming movement in the late 1980s.
Its opposite is recuperation, in which radical ideas are twisted, commodified, and absorbed in a more socially acceptable context.

Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈjoːhan ˈkʁɪsti.aːn ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈhœldɐliːn|lang[/tpl]; 20 March 1770 – 7 June 1843) was a major German lyric poet, commonly associated with the artistic movement known as Romanticism. Hölderlin was also an important thinker in the development of German Idealism, particularly his early association with and philosophical influence on his seminary roommates and fellow Swabians Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling.[ref]"Because of his small philosophical output, it is important to indicate in what way Hölderlin’s ideas have influenced his contemporaries and later thinkers.
It was Hölderlin whose ideas showed Hegel that he could not continue to work on the applications of philosophy to politics without first addressing certain theoretical issues. In 1801, this led Hegel to move to Jena where he was to write the Phenomenology of Spirit.... Schelling’s early work amounts to a development of Hölderlin’s concept of Being in terms of a notion of a prior identity of thought and object in his Philosophy of Identity." Christian J. Onof, "Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin", Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Accessed 15 Jan 2011.[/ref]"Hegel is completely dependent on Hölderlin - on his early efforts to grasp speculatively the course of human life and the unity of its conflicts, on the vividness with which Hölderin's friends made his insight fully convincing, and also certainly on the integrity with which Hölderlin sought to use that insight to preserve his own inwardly torn life." Dieter Henrich, The Course of Remembrance and Other Essays on Hölderlin, Ed. Eckart Förster (Stanford: Stanford University, 1997) p. 139."Indeed, the Pietistic Horizon extended for generations up to and including the time when Hegel, together with his friends Hölderlin and Schelling, spent quiet hours strolling along the banks of the Neckar receiving the theological education they would eventually challenge and transform through the grand tradition now known as German Idealism."

James, Rajah of Sarawak,[tpl]Ref label|A|note|none[/tpl] KCB (born James Brooke; 29 April 1803Birth and Baptism records http://indiafamily.bl.uk/UI/FullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=014-000031913 – 11 June 1868) was a British adventurer whose exploits in the Malay Archipelago made him the first White Rajah of Sarawak.
Born in India and briefly educated in England, he served in the Bengal Army, was wounded, and resigned his commission. He bought a ship and sailed out to the Malay Archipelago, where by helping to crush a rebellion, he became governor of Sarawak. He then vigorously suppressed piracy in the region, and in the ensuing turmoil, restored the sultan of Brunei to his throne, for which the sultan made Brooke the Rajah of Sarawak. He ruled until his death.
Brooke was criticised and officially investigated for his anti-piracy measures. He was however honoured in London for his work. Among his achievements was to attract the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace to the Archipelago, leading to Wallace's eight-year expedition there, and ultimately to his book The Malay Archipelago. One of Brooke's biographers has asserted that Brooke was homosexual, though this is disputed.

[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Current ministerial offices in the United Kingdom, Deputy Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, Cabinet Office (United Kingdom)

The Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (DPM) is a senior member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the Prime Minister, who may appoint to other offices – such as First Secretary of State – to give seniority to a particular Cabinet Minister.  The current Deputy Prime Minister is Nick Clegg, who was also appointed Lord President of the Council along with special responsibility for constitutional and political reform.
Unlike analogous offices in some other nations, such as a vice-presidency, the British deputy prime minister possesses no special constitutional powers as such, though they will always have particular responsibilities in government. They do not assume the duties and powers of the Prime Minister in the latter's absence or illness, such as the powers to seek a dissolution of parliament, appoint peers or brief the sovereign. They do not automatically succeed the Prime Minister, should the latter be incapacitated or resign from the leadership of his or her political party. In practice, however, the designation of someone to the role of Deputy Prime Minister may provide additional practical status within cabinet, enabling the exercise of de facto, if not de jure, power. In a coalition government, such as the current one between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, the appointment of the leader of the smaller party (in the current case, Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats) as Deputy Prime Minister is done to give that person more authority within the cabinet to enforce the coalition's agreed-upon agenda.  The Deputy Prime Minister usually deputises for the Prime Minister at official functions, such as Prime Minister's Questions.

Majapahit was a vast archipelagic empire based on the island of Java (modern-day Indonesia) from 1293 to around 1500. Majapahit reached its peak of glory during the era of Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 marked by conquest which extended through Southeast Asia. His achievement is also credited to his prime minister, Gajah Mada. According to the Nagarakretagama (Desawarñana) written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries, stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea;Majapahit Overseas Empire, Digital Atlas of Indonesian History consisting of present day Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, southern Thailand, Sulu Archipelago, Manila, and East Timor, although the true nature of Majapahit sphere of influence is still the subject of studies among historians.
Majapahit was one of the last major empires of the region and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, one that is sometimes seen as the precedent for Indonesia's modern boundaries. Its influence extended beyond the modern territory of Indonesia and has been the subject of many studies.[ref]Prapantja, Rakawi, trans. by Theodore Gauthier Pigeaud, Java in the 14th Century, A Study in Cultural History: The Negara-Kertagama by Rakawi Prapanca of Majapahit, 1365 AD (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1962), vol. 4, p. 29. 34; G.J.

[[Megafauna]]

CATEGORIES: Megafauna, Extinction

In terrestrial zoology, megafauna (Ancient Greek megas "large" + New Latin fauna "animal")  are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are [tpl]Convert|45|kg|lb|sigfig=1[/tpl][ref]
</ref><ref name = "Johnson">
</ref> or [tpl]Convert|100|kg|lb|0[/tpl].<ref name = "Johnson"/><ref name = "islands&continents">
</ref> This thus includes many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[red kangaroo]], and [[human]]s.
In practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land animals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the Pleistocene megafauna — the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of the last ice age, such as mammoths, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia became extinct as recently as 10,000–40,000 years ago.Ice Age Animals. Illinois State Museum It is also commonly used for the largest extant wild land animals, especially elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and large bovines. Megafauna may be subcategorized by their trophic position into megaherbivores (e.g., elk), megacarnivores (e.g., lions), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., bears).
Other common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially whales, any larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger antelope and cattle, as well as numerous dinosaurs and other extinct giant reptilians.
The term is also sometimes applied to animals (usually extinct) of great size relative to a more common or surviving type of the animal, for example the [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] dragonflies of the Carboniferous period.

Edward Arthur Alexander Shackleton, Baron Shackleton,  KG AC OBE PC FRS FRGS FRCGS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1999.0032[/tpl] (15 July 1911[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]22 September 1994), was a British geographer and Labour Party politician.
Born in Wandsworth, London, he was the younger son of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer. In 1938, he married Betty Homan, and they had two children: the Hon. Charles Edward Ernest Shackleton and the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton.
Shackleton was a member of the 1932 University of Oxford Exploration Club expedition to Sarawak in Borneo organised by Tom Harrisson. During this trip he was the first to attain the peak of Mount Mulu.
In 1934 Shackleton organised the Oxford University Ellesmere Land Expedition and chose Gordon Noel Humphreys to lead it. Shackleton accompanied the party as the assistant surveyor to Humphreys. The expedition was eventually responsible for naming Mount Oxford (after the University of Oxford) and the British Empire Range.
In 1946, Shackleton was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for Preston in a by-election. In 1950, he was elected MP for Preston South, re-elected in 1951. In 1955, he stood down and was made a life peer as Baron Shackleton, of Burley in the County of Hampshire in 1958. In Harold Wilson's government, he served as Minister of Defence for the RAF 1964-1967, Minister without Portfolio 1967-1968 and Paymaster General 1968. He was Leader of the House of Lords from 1968 to 1970, and subsequently Opposition Leader of the House of Lords.

Hagiography [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|h|æ|ɡ|i|ˈ|ɒ|ɡ|r|ə|f|i[/tpl]  (from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ἁγιογραφία[/tpl]; hagiographia, from [tpl]lang|grc|ἅγιος[/tpl], (h)agios, "holy" or "saint" and [tpl]lang|grc|γράφειν[/tpl], graphein, "to write"), refers to the biographies of saints and ecclesiastical leaders. The term "hagiology", the study of hagiography, is also current in English, although less common.
Christian hagiographies focus on the lives, and notably the miracles of men and women canonized by the Roman Catholic church, the Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, and the Church of the East. Other religions such as Buddhism,  Islam  and Sikhism also create and maintain hagiographical texts (such as the Sikh Janamsakhis) concerning saints, gurus and other individuals believed to be imbued with sacred power.
Hagiographic works, particularly those of the Middle Ages, can often incorporate a valuable record of institutional and local history, and evidence of popular cults, customs, and traditions.Davies, S. (2008). Archive and manuscripts: contents and use: using the sources (3rd ed.). Aberystwyth, UK: Department of Information Studies, Aberystwyth University. p. 5.20. ISBN 978-1-906214-15-9 However, when referring to modern, non-ecclesiastical works, the term "hagiography" is often used as a pejorative reference to biographies and histories whose authors are perceived to be uncritical or reverential to their subject.

[[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Lists of government ministers of the United Kingdom, Cabinet Office (United Kingdom)

The Cabinet of the United Kingdom is the collective decision-making body of Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom, composed of the Prime Minister and some 22 Cabinet ministers, the most senior of the government ministers.
Ministers of the Crown, and especially Cabinet ministers, are selected primarily from the elected members of House of Commons, and also from the House of Lords, by the Prime Minister.  Cabinet ministers are heads of government departments, mostly with the office of "Secretary of State for e.g. Defence''". The collective co-ordinating function of the Cabinet is reinforced by the statutory position that all the Secretaries of State jointly hold the same office, and can exercise the same powers.Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 s 3
The Cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of the executive within the Westminster system of government in traditional constitutional theory. This interpretation was originally put across in the work of nineteenth century constitutionalists such as Walter Bagehot, who described the Cabinet as the "efficient secret" of the British political system in his book The English Constitution. The political and decision-making authority of the cabinet has been gradually reduced over the last several decades, with some claiming its role has been usurped by a "prime ministerial" (i.e. more "presidential") government.Foley, Michael, 2000 - The British Presidency pp13–14 via Google Books
The Cabinet is the executive committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council, a body which has legislative, judicial and executive functions, and whose large membership includes members of the Opposition. Its decisions are generally implemented either under the existing powers of individual government departments, or by Orders in Council.

[[Evolutionary economics]]

CATEGORIES: Innovation economics, Heterodox economics, Dichotomies

Evolutionary economics is part of mainstream economicsFriedman, D. (1998). Evolutionary economics goes mainstream: A review of the theory of learning in games. Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 8(4), 423-432. as well as a heterodox school of economic thought that is inspired by evolutionary biology. Much like mainstream economics,  it stresses complex interdependencies, competition, growth, structural change, and resource constraints but differs in the approaches which are used to analyze these phenomena.Geoffrey M. Hodgson (1993) Economics and Evolution: Bringing Life Back Into Economics, Cambridge and University of Michigan Press. Description and chapter-link preview.
Evolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be adaptive efficiency that defines economic efficiency. Mainstream economic reasoning begins with the postulates of scarcity and rational agents (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the "rational choice" for any agent being a straightforward  exercise in mathematical optimization. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of Complexity economics.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Evolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium processes that transform the economy from within and their implications.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with bounded rationality who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on evolutionary game theoryDaniel Friedman (1998).  "On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory," Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 8(1), pp. 15-43. and on the evolutionary methodology of Charles Darwin and the non-equilibrium economics principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is naturalistic in purging earlier notions of economic change as teleological or necessarily improving the human condition.Ulrich Witt (2008). "evolutionary economics." The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 Abstract.
A different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory. Basic economic concepts such as utility may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.Paul H. Rubin and C. Monica Capra. The evolutionary psychology of economics. In [tpl]cite doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001[/tpl]

The regiment is the second to bear the designation, the first being formed out of the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Infantry on 28 July 1866, in the reorganization of the U.S. Army following the American Civil War. However that unit's existence was short-lived, being consolidated with its sister regiment the 22nd Infantry (also formed out of the 13th) in the 1869 reorganization.

[[Profit maximization]]

CATEGORIES: Profit, Pricing

In economics, profit maximization is the short run or long run process by which a firm determines the price and output level that returns the greatest profit. There are several approaches to this problem. The total revenue–total cost perspective relies on the fact that profit equals revenue minus cost and focuses on maximizing this difference, and the marginal revenue–marginal cost perspective is based on the fact that total profit reaches its maximum point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

[[Tights]]
CATEGORIES: Dancewear, History of clothing, Hosiery, Sports clothing, Underwear

Tights are a kind of cloth garment, most often sheathing the body from the waist to the toe tips with a tight fit, hence the name. They come in absolute opaque, opaque, sheer and fishnet styles or a combination of them. Such as the original concept of the American term pantyhose with sheer legs and opaque panty.[tpl]cite patent|country=US|number=2826760|title=Combination Stockings and Panty|gdate=18 March 1958|fdate=9 November 1956|inventor=Ernest G. Rice[/tpl] Wearing of tights has a history going back several centuries, when they were worn by men. Today, they are worn primarily by women and girls and some men and boys, as well as infants and toddlers of both sexes. In recent years, they have been sometimes offered as men's fashion. Athletic tights are already considered unisex.
In American English, the difference between pantyhose and tights is determined in the weight of the yarn used and the thickness to which the garment is knitted. Generally, anything up to 40 denier in the leg or overall is known as pantyhose and anything over can be classified as tights, as for example 'running tights' and 'cycling tights'. In the United Kingdom, the word "tights" is used in all cases when referring to pantyhose, and "leggings" for footless tights of heavier, normally opaque material. Tights can be sheer yet solid in colour, whereas leggings are almost or absolute opaque, not sheer. Thus the almost opaque tights are not suited as pants.
There are many sub-classifications of tights or pantyhose that describe the precise construction (such as control top, seamless, support and sheer). Although most tights are mainly nylon or cotton, lycra is normally included in modern blends to improve fit. Athletic tights are absolute opaque and often footless, although they may have a "stirrup" that goes under the foot to hold the cuff down near the ankle.
In both historic and modern times, the wearing of tight hosiery by males has sometimes been associated with an accompanying garment fitted over the groin of the male genitalia.  In the 15th century, some men wore an elaborate and decorative cod piece to accentuate their genital endowment, and as a symbol of their virility. In modern times, male ballet dancers generally wear a dance belt beneath their tights both to provide support to the genitalia and to promote a smooth, regular appearance since tights are so skin tight as to be revealing of the contours of the male anatomy.

[[Concentration ratio]]
CATEGORIES: Monopoly (economics), Imperfect competition

In economics, a concentration ratio is a measure of the total output produced in an industry by a given number of firms in the industry. The most common concentration ratios are the CR4 and the CR8, which means the market share of the four and the eight largest firms. Concentration ratios are usually used to show the extent of market control of the largest firms in the industry and to illustrate the degree to which an industry is oligopolistic.Concentration Ratios, 16.12.2009
The standard tools of competition economists and competition authorities to measure market concentration are the Herfindahl index (HHI) and the concentration ratios (CR(n)).London economics in association with global energy decisions: Structure and Performance of Six European Wholesale Electricity Markets in 2003, 2004 and 2005, presented to DG Comp 26th February 2007, page 52 and page 8 These two are known as the traditional structural measures of market concentration (based on market shares).

[[Herfindahl index]]

CATEGORIES: Econometrics, Microeconomics, Monopoly (economics), Imperfect competition

The Herfindahl index (also known as Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, or HHI) is a measure of the size of firms in relation to the industry and an indicator of the amount of competition among them.  Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust2010 Merger Guidelines § 5.3 and also technology management.Catherine Liston-Hayes, Alan Pilkington, “Inventive Concentration: An Analysis of Fuel Cell Patents,” Science and Public Policy, (2004). Vol. 31, No. 1, p.15-25. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the market shares of the 50 largest firms (or summed over all the firms if there are fewer than 50)Chapter 9 Organizing Production within the industry, where the market shares are expressed as fractions. The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite. Alternatively, if whole percentages are used, the index ranges from 0 to 10,000 "points".  For example, an index of .25 is the same as 2,500 points.
The major benefit of the Herfindahl index in relationship to such measures as the concentration ratio is that it gives more weight to larger firms.
The measure is essentially equivalent to the Simpson diversity index used in ecology and to the inverse participation ratio (IPR) in physics.

[[Color television]]
CATEGORIES: Film and video technology, History of television, Color, Television technology, 1940 introductions, Display technology

Color television is part of the history of television, the technology of television and practices associated with television's transmission of moving images in color video.
In its most basic form, a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of red, green and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full color image as seen by the viewer.
One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems CommitteeNational Television System Committee (1951–1953), and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953, 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 Library of Congress Online Catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.
Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,[tpl]cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&pg=PA290&dq=color+television+December+17+1953&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XpTGUdq5JO_A4APivoCoDA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290[/tpl] high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.
Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of GE's relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Also in 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.
Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid.
By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s B&W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment, in the television production and post-production industry.

[[Culture of New Zealand]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand culture

The culture of New Zealand is largely inherited from British and European custom, interwoven with Maori and Polynesian tradition. An isolated Pacific Island nation, New Zealand was comparatively recently settled by humans. Initially Māori only, then bicultural with colonial and rural values, now New Zealand is a cosmopolitan culture that reflects its changing demographics, is conscious of the natural environment, and is an educated, developed Western society.
Māori culture has predominated for most of New Zealand's history of human habitation. Māori voyagers reached the islands of New Zealand some time before 1300, though exact dates are uncertain. Over the ensuing centuries of Māori expansion and settlement, Māori culture diverged from its Polynesian roots. Māori established separate tribes, built fortified villages (Pā), hunted and fished, traded commodities, developed agriculture, arts and weaponry, and kept a detailed oral history. Regular European contact began approximately 200 years ago, and British immigration proceeded rapidly during the nineteenth century.
The colonists had a dramatic effect on the indigenous Maori, bringing Christianity, technology, and the English language. In 1840 Māori leaders signed the Treaty of Waitangi, intended to enable the tribes to live peacefully with the colonists. However after several incidents, the treaty was ignored and the New Zealand land wars broke out from 1845, with Māori suffering a loss of land and identity, while also increasingly becoming a minority group over the following century. Despite such setbacks, Māori culture has regained much of its lost influence in recent decades.
European New Zealanders (Pākehā), despite their location far from Europe, retained strong cultural ties to "Mother England."[tpl]cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090808093214/http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3609/features/13619/past_tense.html|title=Past tense|last=Laugesen|first=Ruth|date=11 July 2009|work=The Listener, Vol 219 No 3609|accessdate=7 April 2013[/tpl] These ties were weakened by the demise of the British Empire and loss of special access to British meat and dairy markets. Pākehā began to forge a separate identity influenced by their pioneering history, a rural lifestyle and New Zealand's unique environment. Pākehā culture became prevalent after the land wars, but after sustained political efforts, biculturalism and the Treaty of Waitangi became part of the school curriculum in the late 20th century, to promote understanding between Māori and Pākehā.
More recently, New Zealand culture has been broadened by globalization and immigration from the Pacific Islands, East Asia and South Asia. European and Māori remain the two largest ethnicities, but the large Polynesian population in Auckland has prompted the observation that Auckland is now the largest Polynesian city in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/?titleid=83&xid=idh185804920_0099|title=Auckland and around|work=Rough Guide to New Zealand, Fifth Edition|accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl] However, the country outside of Auckland is still much less heterogeneous, with big parts of the South Island remaining predominantly of European descent.
New Zealand marks two national days of remembrance, Waitangi Day and ANZAC Day, and also celebrates holidays during or close to the anniversaries of the founding dates of each province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/9|title=Government and nation – National holidays|date=3 March 2009|work=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl] New Zealand has two national anthems of equal status; God Save The Queen and "God Defend New Zealand""God save the Queen" is also an official anthem but is rarely sung - the latter of which is often sung with alternating Māori and English verses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/9|title=Government and nation – National anthems|date=3 March 2009|work=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl] Many citizens prefer to minimise ethnic divisions, simply calling themselves New Zealanders or Kiwis.

[[List of surgical procedures]]

CATEGORIES: Surgical procedures

Surgical procedures have long and possibly daunting names. The meaning of many surgical procedure names can often be understood if the name is broken into parts. For example in gastrectomy, "ectomy" is a suffix meaning the removal of a part of the body. "Gastro-" means stomach. Thus, gastrectomy refers to the surgical removal of the stomach (or sections thereof).  "otomy" means to cut into a part of the body;  a gastrotomy would be to cut into, but not necessarily remove, the stomach.
The field of minimally invasive surgery has spawned another set of words, such as arthroscopic or laparoscopic surgery.  These take the same form as above;  an arthroscope is a device which allows the inside of the joint to be seen.

The Lockheed P-3 Orion is a four-engine turboprop anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft developed for the United States Navy and introduced in the 1960s. Lockheed based it on the L-188 Electra commercial airliner."P-3 history." GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved: 14 July 2010. The aircraft is easily recognizable from the Electra by its distinctive tail stinger or "MAD Boom", used for the magnetic detection of submarines.
Over the years, the aircraft has seen numerous design advancements, most notably to its electronics packages. The P-3 Orion is still in use by numerous navies and air forces around the world, primarily for maritime patrol, reconnaissance, anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. A total of 734 P-3s have been built, and during 2012, it joined the handful of military aircraft including the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker that have served 50 years of continuous use by the United States military.  The U.S. Navy's remaining P-3C aircraft will eventually be replaced by the P-8A Poseidon.

Lauryn Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer–songwriter, rapper, producer, and actress. She is best known for being a member of the Fugees and for her solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.
Raised in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin Wyclef Jean soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released two studio albums, Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996), which sold six million copies in the United States. In the latter record, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and a rendition of the hit "Killing Me Softly". Hill's tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997 to focus on solo projects.
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill's only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and finding a contemporary feminist voice with the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles "Doo Wop (That Thing)" (also a number one), "Ex-Factor", and "Everything Is Everything". At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. She won numerous additional awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines.
Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, suffering from the pressures of fame and dissatisfied with the music industry. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2001), sharply divided critics and did not sell nearly as well. Hill's subsequent activity has been sporadic; she has occasionally released songs and performed at music festivals. Her appearances in concert have been erratic and sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Although The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill focused primarily on love, Hill's work with the Fugees and recent repertoire has been heavily focused on social injustice.[tpl]cite news|last=Miller|first=Monica|title=Commentary: It's Time to Be Honest With Lauryn Hill|url=http://www.bet.com/news/national/2013/05/21/commentary-it-s-time-to-be-honest-with-lauryn-hill.html|publisher=Black Entertainment Television|accessdate=June 12, 2013|date=May 21, 2013[/tpl] It is also concerned with racism and female empowerment,[tpl]cite book|last=Perry|first=Imani|title=Prophets of the Hood: Politics and Poetics in Hip Hop|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|page=178|isbn=0-8223-8615-1[/tpl] and she has issued a series of public statements critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley.  In 2012, she pled guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.

CATEGORIES: Polynesian culture, Māori culture

Māori culture is the culture of the Māori of New Zealand (an Eastern Polynesian people) and forms a distinctive part of New Zealand culture. There have been three distinct but overlapping cultural eras—before widespread European contact, the 1800s in which Māori began interacting with European visitors and settlers, and the modern era since the beginning of the 20th century. Within the Māori community, and to a lesser extent throughout New Zealand as a whole, the word Māoritanga is often used as an approximate synonym for Māori culture, the Māori suffix -tanga being roughly equivalent to the qualitative noun ending "-ness" in English.

Swissair, S.A./AG (Schweizerische Luftverkehr"World Airline Directory." Flight International. 28 March-3 April 2000. 102[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl].) was the national airline of Switzerland.
It was formed from a merger between Balair and Ad Astra Aero (To the Stars), in 1931.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=About Swissair Facts and Figures: | url=http://www.swissair.com/aboutus/swissair/facts.htm| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990219220801/www.swissair.com/aboutus/swissair/facts.htm | publisher=Swissair | year=1999 |archivedate=1999-02-19 | accessdate=2008-08-30[/tpl] For most of its 71 years, Swissair was one of the major international airlines and known as the "Flying Bank" due to the financial stability of the airline, causing it to be regarded as a Swiss national symbol and icon. The airline thrived into the 1980s, when it was one of the "big four" Western European airlines. It was headquartered at Zurich Airport and in Kloten.
In 1997 the Swissair Group was renamed SAirGroup (although it was again renamed Swissair Group in 2001), with four subdivisions:  SAirlines (to which Swissair, Crossair, Balair and FlightLease belonged), SAirServices, SAirLogistics and SAirRelations.
After the expansive "Hunter strategy" in the late 1990s and after the economic downturn following the September 11 attacks, Swissair's assets dramatically lost value, grounding the already-troubled airline in October 2001.Hermann, A., & Rammal, H. G. (2010). The grounding of the "flying bank". Management Decision, 48(7), 1048-62. The airline was kept alive until 31 March 2002 by the Swiss Federal government.
On 1 April 2002 successor airline Swiss International Air Lines was founded on the base of former Crossair, taking over most of the routes, planes and staff of the former Swissair. Today, The SAirGroup company still exists and is in the process of being liquidated. Swiss International Air Lines was taken over by the German airline Lufthansa in 2005.http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/695792/fromItemId/751043 Lufthansa - proposed acquisition of Swiss International Air Lines - Australian Competition Commission

An estimated 15,000 political prisoners were "disappeared." He was persecuted, tortured and imprisoned by the Argentine junta in the late 1970s and exiled in 1979 with his wife to Israel. He was widely honored for his work as a journalist and publisher.
In Israel, Timerman wrote and published his most well-known book, Prisoner Without A Name, Cell Without a Number (1981), a memoir of his prison experience that added to his international reputation. A longtime Zionist, he published a strongly critical book about Israel's 1982 Lebanon war.
He returned to Argentina in 1984, and testified to the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons. He continued to write, publishing books in 1987 about Chile under the Augusto Pinochet regime and in 1990 about Cuba under Fidel Castro.

It is located in the north east of Hong Kong Island and includes the areas of the eastern portion of Causeway Bay, Tin Hau, Fortress Hill, North Point, Quarry Bay, Shau Kei Wan, Heng Fa Chuen, and Chai Wan.
Originally a backwater of fishing villages, quarries and dockyards, the Eastern District is now mostly residential, with some industrial areas and several large shopping malls. While most Home Ownership Scheme and public housing estates are located from Sai Wan Ho to Chai Wan, large private housing estates are located within the eastern district, such as Taikoo Shing, Kornhill and Heng Fa Chuen. A commercial hub has been developed from the former industrial areas in western part of Quarry Bay. Hotels and commercial buildings are also developed near Fortress Hill along the coast. 
In the past the district was linked by a single King's Road, which was notoriously congested during peak hours, this had largely been solved by the constructions of the Island Eastern Corridor, the Island Line within the MTR rapid transit system in the 1980s and it contains the long-historied tram line that stretches from Shau Kei Wan towards other districts near the sea shore.

All these Huon eventually achieves with the assistance of the fairy king Oberon.

[[Trepanning]]
CATEGORIES: Body modification, History of neuroscience, Neurosurgery

Trepanning, also known as trephination, trephining or making a burr hole, is a surgical intervention in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the human skull, exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases. It may also refer to any "burr" hole created through other body surfaces, including nail beds.  It is often used to relieve pressure beneath a surface.  A trephine is an instrument used for cutting out a round piece of skull bone.
Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from Neolithic times onward. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and mental disorders.[tpl]cite book |author=Brothwell, Don R. |year=1963 |title=Digging up Bones; the Excavation, Treatment and Study of Human Skeletal Remains |location=London |publisher=British Museum (Natural History) |oclc=14615536 |page=126[/tpl] The bone that was trepanned was kept by the prehistoric people and may have been worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away.  Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head.  Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as slings and war clubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010202194200/%68ttp://www.trepanation.com/master10.htm |title=The Skull Doctors - www.trepanation.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-02-02 |accessdate=2012-04-05[/tpl]
There is some contemporary use of the term.  In modern eye surgery, a trephine instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a subungual hematoma (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated.

Longinus is the name given in medieval and some modern Christian traditions to the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus in his side with a lance, the "Holy Lance" (lancea, as related in the Latin Vulgate Bible) while he was on the Cross.John 19:34. This act created the last of the Five Holy Wounds of Christ. The figure is unnamed in the gospels. The Longinus legend further identifies this soldier as the centurion present at the Crucifixion, who testified, "In truth this man was son of God."Matthew 27:54; Mark 15:39. Longinus' legend grew over the years to the point that he was said to have converted to Christianity after the Crucifixion, and he is traditionally venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and several other Christian communions.

The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (Massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy in French) in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations, followed by a wave of Catholic mob violence, both directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants), during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Catherine de' Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre took place five days after the wedding of the king's sister Margaret to the Protestant Henry III of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France). This marriage was an occasion for which many of the most wealthy and prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris.
The massacre began in the night of 23-24 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle), two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.
The massacre also marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file, and those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it "was the worst of the century's religious massacres."H. G. Koenigsberger, George L. Mosse, G. Q. Bowler (1999), Europe in the Sixteenth Century, Second Edition, Longman ISBN 0582418631 Throughout Europe, it "printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion".[tpl]aut|Chadwick, H.[/tpl] & Evans, G.

The Malacca Sultanate (Malay: Kesultanan Melayu Melaka; Jawi script: كسلطانن ملايو ملاك) was a Malay sultanate centered in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks circa 1400 as the founding year of the sultanate by a renegade Malay Raja of Singapura,  Iskandar Shah, who was also known in certain accounts as "Parameswara". At the height of the sultanate's power in the 15th century, its capital grew into one of the most important entrepots of its time, with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula, Riau Islands and a significant portion of the east coast of Sumatra.[tpl]harvnb|Ahmad Sarji|2011|p=119[/tpl]
As a bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a center for Islamic learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the lingua franca of the Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, the Malaccan era witnessed the enculturation of a Malay identity,[tpl]harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=55[/tpl] the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of an Alam Melayu.[tpl]harvnb|Mohamed Anwar|2011|pp=28–30[/tpl]
In 1511, the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire, forcing the last Sultan, Mahmud Shah (r. 1488–1511), to retreat to the further reaches of his empire, where his progeny established new ruling dynasties, Johor and Perak. The legacy of the sultanate remained, with significance lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy, which, arguably, continues to be felt in modern times. For centuries, Malacca has been held up as an exemplar of Malay-Muslim civilization. It established systems of trade, diplomacy, and governance that persisted well into the 19th century, and introduced concepts such as daulat – a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty – that continues to shape contemporary understanding of Malay kingship.[tpl]harvnb|Ahmad Sarji|2011|p=109[/tpl]

Finland Swedish ([tpl]lang-sv|finlandssvenska[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fi|suomenruotsi[/tpl]) is a general term for standard Finland Swedish and the closely related cluster[tpl]clarify|How can practically unintelligible variants be part of such a closely related cluster?|date=June 2012[/tpl] of dialects of Swedish spoken in Finland by the Swedish-speaking population as their mother tongue. For the most part, these dialects and the dialects spoken in Sweden are mutually intelligible, although some archaic Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia are practically unintelligible to Swedish-speaking people in southern Finland (and in Sweden). Most Swedish-speaking Finns emphasize that Finland Swedish is not a language separate from the Swedish of Sweden. The Swedish dialects in Finland are considered varieties of Swedish, and the norm for written Standard Swedish is completely applicable also for Finland Swedish.
Swedish as spoken in Finland is regulated by the Swedish Department of the Institute for the Languages of Finland. This regulation includes the officially stated aim of keeping Finland Swedish close to the Swedish as spoken in Sweden and strongly phrased advice against loanwords and calques from Finnish, which are usually incomprehensible to Swedes.
An often repeated "fact" is that the municipality with the highest proportion of Swedish speakers in the world, Hammarland (96% [tpl]As of|2004|lc=on[/tpl]), is located in Finland. Korsnäs has also held this title and is often cited as such. However, as there are no official statistics on the mother tongue of inhabitants of Sweden, this is hard or impossible to verify and should probably be taken with a grain of salt.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
In the spoken slang-language, especially among young people in Finnish-dominated areas, Finnish loanwords as well as calques from Finnish are frequently incorporated into Finland Swedish. There are also some words in Finland Swedish that would be considered slightly archaic in Sweden. Some government and public service terms that have been created in recent centuries also differ. The same is true of other new words, notably loanwords from English.

Ford Park Cemetery is a [tpl]convert|34.5|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] cemetery in central Plymouth, England, established by the Plymouth, Stonehouse & Devonport Cemetery Company in 1846 and opened in 1848.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plymouthdata.info/Cemeteries.htm|title=Cemeteries|last=Moseley|first=Brian|date=10 April 2008|work=The Encyclopaedia of Plymouth History|publisher=Plymouthdata|accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl] At the time it was outside the boundary of the Three Towns and was created to alleviate the overcrowding in the churchyards of the local parish churches. Its official name at the time of inception was The Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse (Ford Park) Cemetery,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] although it is now seldom referred to by that title.
The cemetery was originally [tpl]convert|18|acre|m2[/tpl] in size, but a further [tpl]convert|16.5|acre|m2[/tpl] were added in 1875. It came into use during one of the largest outbreaks of cholera in the country and during its first year it saw over 400 burials related to that disease. During Victorian times it was the main cemetery for the Three Towns,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/outdoors/walks/plymouth_cemetary.shtml|title=Trail highlights Victorian past|date=15 April 2005|publisher=BBC Devon|accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl] and it is estimated that approximately a quarter of a million people are buried within its grounds.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]. The older burial records have been deposited with the Plymouth and West Devon Record Office.
Among the more famous graves is that of the Reverend Robert Stephen Hawker, the author of The Song of the Western Men. There are 752 war graves from the First World War, over 200 of which are in a dedicated naval plot; and 198 war graves of the Second World War (including an unidentified airman) are scattered throughout the site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/cemetery_details.aspx?cemetery=2086000&mode=1|title=Ford Park Cemetery (formerly Plymouth Old Cemetery) (Pennycomequick)|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl] A Victoria Cross recipient of the Crimean War, Captain Andrew Henry, Royal Artillery, is buried here.http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/devonshi.htm Burial Locations VC Holders, Devonshire.

Along the top side is a connected but walled-off Jewish cemetery.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2008[/tpl]
During the 1970s and 80s, poor management, a loss of revenue because few people were paying for the maintenance of plots, and the popularity of cremation, all led to the dilapidation of the site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2008/04/11/ford_park_cemetery_sg_feature.shtml|title=Bringing life back to a Plymouth cemetery|last=Geddes|first=Stuart|date=11 April 2008|publisher=BBC Devon|accessdate=27 August 2008[/tpl] In January 1988, seventeen-year-old Patricia Hicks was murdered in the overgrown cemetery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=iNpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3aYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5642,5101506&dq=patricia+hicks&hl=en|title=Graveyard Death Charge|publisher=Evening Times|date=28 January 1988|accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl] After the original cemetery company went into liquidation and after much public debate, in 2000 a trust was set up which reopened the cemetery, made dangerous structures safe, cleared the undergrowth, obtained renovation grants and created a walking trail around some of the graves of notable people. The older of the two chapels which is shown above right in a photograph of its unrestored state has now been fully restored and refurbished as a setting for all varieties of religious or secular funeral or memorial services and is also used for concerts and other events.
The cemetery is a member of the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe and the trust was awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cemeteryfriends.org.uk/87.html|title=Ford Park Cemetery Trust|publisher=National Federation of Cemetery Friends|accessdate=11 October 2008[/tpl] As at 2009, there are further plans for numerous works to restore and improve various parts of the cemetery, aided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, including the renovation of the Anglican chapel,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ford-park-cemetery.org/|title=Ford Park Cemetery Home – Stop Press!|publisher=Ford Park Cemetery Trust|accessdate=11 October 2008[/tpl] (Archived here.) and provision of a memorial to the civilian dead of World War Two. It is estimated there are over 10,000 usable grave spaces remaining in the cemetery. The cemetery has rapidly become popular again as an attractive convenient and semi-rural setting close to the city centre and the densely populated but fashionable Victorian and Edwardian suburbs.
The City of Plymouth has two large early twentieth century municipal cemeteries at Weston Mill and Efford, each with chapels and now crematoria and the Drake Memorial Garden is near Elburton.

[[Second language]]

CATEGORIES: Language

A person's second language is a language that is not the mother tongue of, but that is used in the area of, that person. In contrast, a foreign language is a language that is learned in an area where that language is not generally spoken. Some languages, often called auxiliary languages, are used primarily as second languages or lingua francas.
More informally, a second language or L2 can be said to be any language learned in addition to one's mother tongues, especially in context of second language acquisition (that is, learning a new foreign language).
A person's first language is not necessarily their dominant language, the one they use most or are most comfortable with. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as language attrition. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of immigration or international adoption), to a new language environment.

[[Plesiochronous system]]

CATEGORIES: Network architecture, Synchronization

In telecommunications, a plesiochronous system is one where different parts of the system are almost, but not quite, perfectly synchronised. According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are plesiochronous if their significant instants occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal frequency but may have a slight frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase.P. Teehan, M. Greenstreet, G. Lemieux: A Survey and Taxonomy of GALS Design Styles, IEEE Design & Test of Computers September–October 2007, p.419S. Johnson, S. Scott: A Supercomputer System Interconnect and Scalable IOS, 14th IEEE Symposium on Mass Storage Systems, 1995, Footnote on p.358 The mismatch between the two systems' clocks is known as the plesiochronous difference.
In general, plesiochronous systems behave similarly to synchronous systems, except they must employ some means in order to cope with "sync slips", which will happen at intervals due to the plesiochronous nature of the system. The most common example of a plesiochronous system design is the plesiochronous digital hierarchy networking standard.
The asynchronous serial communication protocol is asynchronous on the byte level, but plesiochronous on the bit level. The receiver detects the start of a byte by detecting a transition that may occur at a random time after the preceding byte. The indefinite wait and lack of external synchronizaton signals makes byte detection asynchronous. Then the receiver samples at predefined intervals to determine the values of the bits in the byte; this is plesiochronous since it depends on the transmitter to transmit at roughly the same rate the receiver expects, without coordination of the rate while the bits are being transmitted.
The modern tendency in systems engineering is towards using systems that are either fundamentally asynchronous (such as Ethernet), or fundamentally synchronous (such as synchronous optical networking), and layering these where necessary, rather than using a mixture between the two in a single technology.
The term plesiochronous comes from the Greek πλησίον plesion, "near" and χρόνος chrónos, "time".

He died in 1700, childless and heirless, with all potential Habsburg successors having predeceased him.

[[Asynchrony]]

CATEGORIES: Communication, Synchronization

Asynchrony, in the general meaning, is the state of not being synchronized.
In specific terms of digital logic and physical layer of communication, an asynchronous process does not require a clock signal, in contrast with synchronous and plesiochronous systems.
At the higher data link layer of communication, asynchrony is synonym of statistical multiplexing, such as in packet mode. The information transmission may or may not start immediately as requested by sender, the additional delay being caused by medium congestion. Contrast with example of circuit switched communication, which (once circuit is established) allows immediate start of transfer with a guaranteed bit rate. Confusingly, a communication is often synchronous at the physical layer, while being asynchronous at the data link layer.
In computer programming, asynchronous events are those occurring independently of the main program flow. Asynchronous actions are actions executed in a non-blocking scheme, allowing the main program flow to continue processing.Microsoft documentation describing asynchronous message processing. Accessed on 09-09-2007.
In electric motors, an asynchronous motor is a variant where the electromagnetic field turns with a different (higher) speed than the rotor; the difference is called slip.

Classical musicians and conductors held him in high regard for his story-driven biopics of various composers, most famously Elgar, Delius, Liszt, Mahler and Tchaikovsky.Norman Lebrecht "Ken Russell and Mahler: fragments of conversation", artsjournal.com, 28 November 2011
Film critic Mark Kermode speaking in 2006, and attempting to sum up the director's achievement, called Russell, "somebody who proved that British cinema didn't have to be about kitchen-sink realism—it could be every bit as flamboyant as Fellini.  Later in his life he turned to making experimental films such as Lion's Mouth and Revenge of the Elephant Man, and they are as edgy and 'out there' as ever".Mark Kermode, speaking to Lauren Laverne, on BBC2's The Culture Show, October 2006.
Ken Russell died on 27 November 2011, at the age of 84, of natural causes.

CATEGORIES: Fictional admirals, Fictional characters introduced in 1983, Fictional extraterrestrial characters, Fictional slaves, Puppets, Star Wars characters

Admiral Gial Ackbar is a fictional character in the Star Wars science fiction saga. A member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the Rebel Alliance who led major combat operations against the Galactic Empire. Ackbar played a supporting role in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, and later became a prominent character in the novels, comic books and other media of the Star Wars Expanded Universe.
With his distinctive salmon-colored skin, high-domed head and large fish-like eyes, Admiral Ackbar was realized in Return of the Jedi through the use of a half-body puppet and slip-on mask, depending on the camera angles used. He was portrayed in the film by puppeteer Timothy M. Rose, who asked to play the part after he was impressed with a sculpt of the puppet. Ackbar was voiced by Erik Bauersfeld, who made up the voice he believed matched the character after looking at a photo of Ackbar.
The Ackbar character has been received positively by critics and fans. The line "It's a trap!", which he says during a scene in Return of the Jedi, was one of the most popular lines from the Star Wars films and became a popular Internet meme. The first name of Ackbar's character, Gial, was not established until the April 2012 release of the Star Wars reference book The Essential Guide to Warfare.

The Hongwu Emperor (Chinese: [tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|洪|武|帝[/tpl][/tpl], p Hóngwǔdì; 21 October 1368 – 24 June 1398), also known by his given name Zhu Yuanzhang ([tpl]lang|zh|朱元璋[/tpl]) and his temple name Ming Taizu ([tpl]lang|zh|明太祖[/tpl], lit. "Great Ancestor of the Ming"), was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty of China. His era name Hongwu means "vastly martial."
In the middle of the 14th century, with famine, plagues, and peasant revolts sweeping across China, Zhu rose to command the force that conquered China and ended the Yuan Dynasty, forcing the Mongols to retreat to the central Asian steppe. Following his seizure of the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (modern Beijing), Zhu claimed the Mandate of Heaven and established the Ming Dynasty in 1368. Trusting only in his family, he made his many sons powerful feudal princes along the northern marshes and the Yangtze valley. Having outlived his first successor, the Hongwu Emperor enthroned his grandson via a series of instructions; this ended in failure when the Jianwen Emperor's attempt to unseat his uncles led to the Yongle Emperor's successful rebellion.Chan Hok-lam.

Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.
In the 1940s, together with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including The Heiress, Home at Seven and Three Sisters.  He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death, at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays.
Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including Things to Come in the 1930s, The Fallen Idol and The Heiress in the 1940s,  and Long Day's Journey into Night and  Doctor Zhivago in the 1960s. He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death, and beyond, with a posthumous Academy Award nomination for his final film, Greystoke.
Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

E. F. Hutton & Co. was an American stock brokerage firm founded in 1904 by Edward Francis Hutton, his brother Franklyn Laws Hutton, and later led by well known Wall Street trader Gerald M. Loeb.  Under their leadership, Hutton became one of the most respected financial firms in the United States and for several decades was the second largest brokerage firm in the United States. The firm was best known for its commercials in the 1970s and 1980s based on the phrase, "When E. F. Hutton talks, people listen" (which usually involved a young professional remarking at a dinner party that his broker was E.F. Hutton, which caused the moderately loud party to stop all conversation to listen to him).
Hutton was one of the first brokerages to open offices in California.  It also operated seasonal offices in Palm Beach, Florida (winter) and Saratoga Springs, New York (summer) to cater to its customers. Morrie Cohen opened Hutton's first one-man office on Maui in December 1969.
Edward Hutton led the firm until his death in 1962.  By the early 1980s, the brokerage house he founded had become the principal component of what grew into a conglomerate of companies owned by E. F. Hutton Group Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Other subsidiaries of that Delaware-chartered holding company were E. F. Hutton Trust Company (now "Smith Barney Corporate Trust Company" and owned by Citigroup), E. F. Hutton Life Insurance Company, and E. F. Hutton Bank.  The Hutton companies also managed many mutual funds and other investment vehicles, some of which were separately incorporated and/or registered, and participated actively in corporate mergers and public offerings of securities.
As a result of several mergers, the remains of the old E.F. Hutton are now part of Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Citigroup.  However, on January 13, 2009, Citigroup itself announced that it would sell 51% of Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley, creating Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which was formerly a division of Citi Global Wealth Management.
E.F. Hutton was revived in April 2012 by a management team composed of executives of the former firm and Stanley Hutton Rumbough, grandson of E.F. Hutton.Surprise! E.F. Hutton talks again as firm resurrected April 23, 2012 InvestmentNews

The Crimean Peninsula ([tpl]lang-ru|Крымский полуостров[/tpl], [tpl]lang-uk|Кримський півострів[/tpl], [tpl]lang-crh|Qırım yarımadası[/tpl]), also known simply as Crimea, is a major land mass on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is almost completely surrounded by water. The peninsula is located just south of the Ukrainian mainland and west of the Russian region of Kuban. It is surrounded by two seas: the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the east. It is connected with the Ukrainian mainland by the Isthmus of Perekop and is separated from Kuban by the Strait of Kerch. The Arabat Spit is located to the northeast; a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov.
Crimea—or the Tauric Peninsula, as it was formerly known—has historically been at the boundary between the classical world and the steppe. Its southern fringe was colonised by the ancient Greeks, the ancient Romans, the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading steppe nomads, such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, Goths, Bulgars, Huns, Khazars, Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde.
Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the Crimean Khanate during the 15th to 18th century before falling to the Russian Empire and being organised as its Taurida Oblast in 1783. In 1954, the Soviet Crimean Oblast was transferred from Russia to Ukraine. It became the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine in 1991, with Sevastopol having its own administration within Ukraine but outside of the Autonomous Republic.
Sovereignty and control of the peninsula became the subject of the ongoing 2014 Crimean crisis, a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine.

The Mau Mau Uprising (also known as the Mau Mau Revolt, Mau Mau Rebellion and Kenya Emergency) was a military conflict that took place in Kenya[tpl]ref label|Note2|B|B[/tpl] between 1952 and 1960.

The capture of rebel leader Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 signalled the ultimate defeat of Mau Mau, and essentially ended the British military campaign.
Mau Mau failed to capture widespread public support,The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army (1994) p. 346. partly due to the British policy of divide and rule,[tpl]Harvnb|Füredi|1989|p=5[/tpl]. and the movement remained internally divided, despite attempts to unify its various strands.

Leaving well before the main army of knights and their followers, Walter led his band through the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Serbian (Syrmian) and Bulgarian province of the Eastern Roman Empire, traveling separately from Peter. While they passed through Germany and Hungary uneventfully, Walter's followers plundered the Belgrade area, drawing reprisals upon themselves. From here they continued to Constantinople under Byzantine escort.
Walter and Peter joined forces at Constantinople where Alexius I Comnenus provided transport across the Bosporus. Despite Peter's entreaties to restrain themselves, the Crusaders engaged the Turks at once and were cut to pieces.

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (April 5, 1902 OS – June 12, 1994 NS), known as the Lubavitcher Rebbe or just the RebbeEncyclopedia Judaica, Second Edition, Volume 18 page 149 was a prominent Hasidic rabbi who was the seventh and last Rebbe (Hasidic leader) of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. He was fifth in a direct paternal line to the third Chabad-Lubavitch Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneersohn. In January 1951, a year after the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, he assumed the leadership of the Lubavitch movement.
He led the movement until his death in 1994, greatly expanding its worldwide activities and founding a worldwide network of institutions to spread traditional religious practices among the Jewish people.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0602/feature4/index.html |title=National Geographic Magazine February 2006 |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl] These institutions include schools, kindergartens, synagogues and Chabad houses.

[[Kerbogha]]

CATEGORIES: Turkic rulers, Muslims of the First Crusade

Kerbogha ([tpl]lang-ar|كربغا[/tpl], [tpl]lang-tr|Kürboğa[/tpl]) was Atabeg of Mosul during the First Crusade and was renowned as a soldier. Runciman, Steven. "A History of the Crusades". Cambridge University Press, 1987. page 215
He was a Turk who owed his success to his military talent.Bradbury, Jim. "The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare". Routledge, 2004. page 55 In 1098, when he heard that the Crusaders had besieged Antioch, he gathered his troops and marched to relieve the city. By the time he arrived, around June 5-9, the Crusaders had been in possession of the city since 3 June. They were not able to restock the city before Kerbogha, in turn, was besieging the Crusaders in the city.
During the siege, Peter the Hermit was sent as emissary to Kerbogha by the Christian princes in the city, to suggest that the parties settle all differences by duel. Presumably feeling his position secure, Kerbogha did not see this course of action as being in his interest and he declined.
During the siege, inside the city, Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance through a vision. This discovery re-energized the Christian army. At the same time, disagreements and infighting broke out within the Atabeg's army. Kerbogha's mighty army was actually made up of levies from Baghdad and Persia, Palestine and Damascus, and the internal quarrels amongst the Emirs took precedence over any unity against the Franks.  The only thing that united his allies was a common fear of Kerbogha's real goal, the conquest of all their lands.  If Antioch fell, he would be invincible.Jones, Terry., Ereira, Alan. "Crusades". Penguin Books, 1996. pp.43  
On 28 June, when Bohemond, the leader of the Christian army decided to attack, the Emirs decided to humble Kerbogha and they abandoned him at the critical moment.  Kerbogha was taken by surprise because the information he had received was of a weak, disorganized Christian army. Instead, he found himself facing a motivated, unified Christian army so large that Kerbogha's strategy of dividing his own forces was ineffective.Gesta Francorum:The Defeat of Kerbogha, excerpt online at Medieval Sourcebook, accessed November, 2008. He had to retreat, and returned to Mosul a broken man.

[[Capital asset pricing model]]

CATEGORIES: Finance theories, Mathematical finance, Financial markets, Portfolio theories

In finance, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, if that asset is to be added to an already well-diversified portfolio, given that asset's non-diversifiable risk. The model takes into account the asset's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk (also known as systematic risk or market risk), often represented by the quantity beta (β) in the financial industry, as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset. CAPM “suggests that an investor’s cost of equity capital is determined by beta.”[tpl]cite web|title=The Entrepreneur's Cost of Capital: Incorporating Downside Risk in the Buildup Method|url=http://www.macrorisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MRA-WP-2013-e.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2013|author=James Chong|coauthors=Yanbo Jin; Michael Phillips|date=April 29, 2013[/tpl][tpl]rp|2[/tpl]
The CAPM was introduced by Jack Treynor (1961, 1962),[tpl]cite journal |last=French |first=Craig W. |year=2003 |title=The Treynor Capital Asset Pricing Model |journal=Journal of Investment Management |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=60–72 |ssrn=447580 [/tpl] William Sharpe (1964), John Lintner (1965a,b) and Jan Mossin (1966) independently, building on the earlier work of Harry Markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory.  Sharpe, Markowitz and Merton Miller jointly received the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for this contribution to the field of financial economics.  Fischer Black (1972) developed another version of CAPM, called Black CAPM or zero-beta CAPM, that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset.  This version was more robust against empirical testing and was influential in the widespread adoption of the CAPM.
Despite its empirical flaws[tpl]cite journal |last=Fama |first=Eugene F |last2=French |first2=Kenneth R |date=Summer 2004 |title=The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Theory and Evidence |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=25-46 |doi=10.1257/0895330042162430[/tpl] and the existence of more modern approaches to asset pricing and portfolio selection (such as arbitrage pricing theory and Merton's portfolio problem), the CAPM still remains popular due to its simplicity and utility in a variety of situations.

[[Open-end fund]]

CATEGORIES: Collective investment schemes

Open-end fund (or open-ended fund) is a collective investment scheme which can issue and redeem shares at any time. An investor will generally purchase shares in the fund directly from the fund itself rather than from the existing shareholders. It contrasts with a closed-end fund, which typically issues all the shares it will issue at the outset, with such shares usually being tradable between investors thereafter.
Open-ended funds are available in most developed countries, though terminology and operating rules vary. U.S. mutual funds, UK unit trusts and OEICs, European SICAVs, hedge funds and exchange-traded funds are all examples of open-ended funds.
The price at which shares in an open-ended fund are issued or can be redeemed will vary in proportion to the net asset value of the fund, and therefore directly reflects the fund's performance.

[[Closed-end fund]]

CATEGORIES: Exchange-traded products, Collective investment schemes

A closed-end fund (or closed-ended fund) is a collective investment scheme that has a fixed number of shares. Unlike open-end funds, new shares/units in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.http://www.sec.gov/answers/mfclose.htm Instead, the shares can  be purchased (and sold) only in the market. This is the original design of the mutual fund which predates open-end mutual funds but offers the same actively managed pooled investments.
Closed-end funds are usually listed on a recognized stock exchange and can be bought and sold on that exchange. The price per share is determined by the market and is usually different from the underlying value or net asset value (NAV) per share of the investments held by the fund. The price is said to be at a discount or premium to the NAV when it is below or above the NAV, respectively.
A premium might be due to the market's confidence in the investment managers' ability or the underlying securities to produce above-market returns. A discount might reflect the charges to be deducted from the fund in future by the managers, uncertainty due to high amounts of leverage, concerns related to liquidity or lack of investor confidence in the underlying securities.
In the United States, closed-end funds are referred to under the law as closed-end companies and they form one of three SEC recognized types of investment companies along with mutual funds and unit investment trusts.http://www.sec.gov/answers/mfclose.htm Examples of closed-ended funds in other countries are investment trusts in the United Kingdom and listed investment companies in Australia.

Eurico Gaspar Dutra ([tpl]IPA-pt|ewˈɾiku ɡasˈpaɾ ˈdutrɐ|lang[/tpl]; 1883–1974), was a Brazilian marshal, politician and president of Brazil from 1946–1951.
He was born in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, and like many other Brazilians, was of Azorean-Portuguese origin. In 1936, he was appointed as Minister of War, a post he held until the end of World War II.
In this position, he played a key role along with Vargas and General Goes Monteiro, on conspiracy and establishment of the dictatorship of the Estado Novo, on November 10, 1937 and the repression of the uprising of the local fascists in May 1938. He remained as Minister of War until leaving office to contest the presidential election of 1945.
During World War II, he was among the Brazilian military leaders who were against an alignment with allies and a deeper involvement of the country in the conflict. With, although modest, Brazil's participation in the war on the Allied side, and the growing pressure from civil society for democratization of the country, Dutra formally adhered to the idea of the end of the regime that started in 1930, participating in the following deposition of Getúlio Vargas in October 1945, continuing the interventionist doctrine, practiced at the time by the Brazilian army.McCann; Frank D. "Soldiers of the Patria: A History of the Brazilian Army, 1889–1937" Stanford University Press 2004, Page 441, Last but one paragraph View on Google Books

In this context, the deposed leader announced the following month his support for Dutra, candidate of the Army, at the expense of the candidate of the Air Force, Eduardo Gomes, in the elections that followed.
He left it in 1951 and until then, he was considered as a presidential candidate.
Gaspar Dutra died in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's former capital.

[[Bubble memory]]
CATEGORIES: Computer memory, Non-volatile memory

Bubble memory is a type of non-volatile computer memory that uses a thin film of a magnetic material to hold small magnetized areas, known as bubbles or domains, each storing one bit of data. The material is arranged to form a series of parallel tracks that the bubbles can move along under the action of an external magnetic field. The bubbles are read by moving them to the edge of the material where they can be read by a conventional magnetic pickup, and then rewritten on the far edge to keep the memory cycling through the material. In operation, bubble memories are similar to delay line memory systems.
Bubble memory started out as a promising technology in the 1980s, offering memory density of a similar order as hard drives but performance more comparable to core memory. This led many to consider it a contender for a "universal memory" that could be used for all storage needs. However, the introduction of dramatically faster semiconductor memory chips pushed bubble into the slow end of the scale, and equally dramatic improvements in hard drive capacity made it uncompetitive in price terms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/tech/2012/10/10-technologies-that-were-supposed-to-blow-but-never-did/bubble-memory |title=Bubble Memory — 10 Technologies that were Supposed to Blow Up but Never Did |publisher=Complex |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-03[/tpl] Bubble memory was used for some time in the 1970s and 80s where its non-moving nature was desirable for maintenance or shock-proofing reasons. The introduction of Flash RAM and similar technologies rendered even this niche uncompetitive, and bubble disappeared entirely by the late 1980s.

[[Future]]

CATEGORIES: Future, Philosophy of time

The future is what will happen in the time period after the present. Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics.  Due to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist for the whole of the future, or temporary, meaning that it won't and thus will come to an end.  The future and the concept of eternity have been major subjects of philosophy, religion, and science, and defining them non-controversially has consistently eluded the greatest of minds.Hastings, J., Selbie, J. A., & Gray, L. H. (1908). Encyclopædia of religion and ethics. Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark. Page 335–337.  In the Occidental view, which uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the projected time line that is anticipated to occur.Moore, C.-L., & Yamamoto, K. (1988). Beyond words: movement observation and analysis. New York: Gordon and Breach. Page 57. (cf., The representation of time as a linear, unidirectional progression is a distinctly Occidental point of view.) In special relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future light cone.Eddington, A. S. (1921). Space, time and gravitation; an outline of the general relativity theory. Cambridge: University Press. Page 107.
In the philosophy of time, presentism is the belief that only the present exists and the future and the past are unreal. Religions consider the future when they address issues such as karma, life after death, and eschatologies that study what the end of time and the end of the world will be. Religious figures such as prophets and diviners have claimed to see into the future. Organized efforts to predict or forecast the future may have derived from observations by early man of heavenly objects.
Future studies, or futurology, is the science, art and practice of postulating possible futures. Modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.
The future has been explored through several art movements and cultural genres. The futurism art movement at the beginning of the 20th century, explored every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, poetry, theatre, music, architecture and even gastronomy. Futurists had  passionate loathing of ideas from the past, especially political and artistic traditions. Instead, they espoused a love of speed, technology, and violence.Umbro Apollonio (ed.), Futurist Manifestos, MFA Publications, 2001 ISBN 978-0-87846-627-6[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/|title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism|publisher=italianfuturism.org (Originally published on Le Figaro,Paris, February 20, 1909)[/tpl] Futuristic music involved homage to, inclusion of, or imitation of machines.

Steeleye Span are an English folk-rock band formed in 1969. Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles "Gaudete" and "All Around My Hat". They had three Top 40 albums; they achieved a certified gold record with sales of "All Around My Hat". 
Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes but have maintained a strong continuity of tradition. Their typical album is a collection of mostly traditional songs with one or two instrumental tracks of jigs and/or reels added; the traditional songs often include some of the Child ballads. In their later albums there has been an increased tendency to include music written by the band members, but they have never got completely away from traditional music, which draws upon pan-British traditions.

[[Interest rate]]

CATEGORIES: Interest rates, Mathematical finance, Monetary policy

An interest rate is the rate at which interest is paid by a borrower (debtor) for the use of money that they borrow from a lender (creditor). Specifically, the interest rate (I/m) is a percent of principal (P) paid a certain amount of times (m) per period (usually quoted per annum). For example, a small company borrows capital from a bank to buy new assets for its business, and in return the lender receives interest at a predetermined interest rate for deferring the use of funds and instead lending it to the borrower. Interest rates are normally expressed as a percentage of the principal for a period of one year.Definition of interest rate from Investorwords.com
Interest-rate targets are a vital tool of monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment, inflation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market. This happened in Japan in the late 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in the large unpaid debts to the Japanese banks and the bankruptcy of these banks and causing stagflation in the Japanese economy (Japan being the world's second largest economy at the time), with exports becoming the last pillar for the growth of the Japanese economy throughout the rest of 1990s and early 2000s. The same scenario resulted from the United States' lowering of interest rate since late 1990s to the present (see 2007–2012 global financial crisis) substantially by the decision of the Federal Reserve System. Under Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdom's economy maintained stable growth by not allowing the Bank of England to reduce interest rates. In developed economies, interest-rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/02/usa-debt-inflation-idUSN1E7711UC20110802 |work=Reuters |title=INSIGHT-Mild inflation, low interest rates could help economy |date=2 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Sepehri |first=Ardeshir |last2=Moshiri |first2=Saeed |year=2004 |title=Inflation‐Growth Profiles Across Countries: Evidence from Developing and Developed Countries |journal=International Review of Applied Economics |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=191–207 |doi=10.1080/0269217042000186679 [/tpl]http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2003/06/pdf/inflatio.pdfhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2003/06/index.htmhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2010/03/basics.htm

[[Investment banking]]

CATEGORIES: Investment banking, Separation of investment and commercial banking

An investment bank is a financial institution that assists individuals, corporations, and governments in raising capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities (or both). An investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions and provide ancillary services such as market making, trading of derivatives and equity securities, and FICC services (fixed income instruments, currencies, and commodities).
Unlike commercial banks and retail banks, investment banks do not take deposits. From 1933 (Glass–Steagall Act) until 1999 (Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act), the United States maintained a separation between investment banking and commercial banks. Other industrialized countries, including G8 countries, have historically not maintained such a separation. As part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act of 2010), Volcker Rule asserts full institutional separation of investment banking services from commercial banking.
There are two main lines of business in investment banking. 
An investment bank can also be split into private and public functions with an information barrier which separates the two to prevent information from crossing. The private areas of the bank deal with private insider information that may not be publicly disclosed, while the public areas such as stock analysis deal with public information.
An advisor who provides investment banking services in the United States must be a licensed broker-dealer and subject to Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulation.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

[[Postal card]]

CATEGORIES: Philatelic terminology, Postal stationery

Postal cards are postal stationery with an imprinted stamp or indicium signifying the prepayment of postage. They are sold by postal authorities.  On January 26, 1869, Dr. Emanuel Herrmann of Austria described the advantages of a Correspondenz Karte.Österreich 1850-1918, Spezialkatalog und Handbuch, von Dr. Ulrich FERCHENBAUER, Wien 1981, p.503 By October 1, 1869 the world's first postal card was produced by Austria-Hungary.Van Gelder, Peter J.; The Collectors' Guide to Postal Stationery, A Squirrel Publication (1997) ISBN 0-947604-07-3  They caught on quickly. By the end of 1870, Great Britain, Finland, Switzerland and Württemberg joined the countries issuing postal cards. In the United States, they were first produced in 1873.Bussey, Lewis E., Ed.; United States Postal Card Catalog, United Postal Stationery Society, 2010, 248 pages. A complete and authoritative look at U.S. postal cards.  Some of the forms taken by postal cards include the regular single card which may be commemorative or definitive, attached message-reply cards, airmail postal cards, and official postal cards used for official government business with a "penalty for private use".
To the post office, there were positive advantages to postal cards as opposed to correspondence in envelopes. The cards were lighter and less bulky than letters and they were all the same size. The result was that they occupied less than one third of the space required by the same number of letters.  To the public there were also advantages.  They were simple and cheap making them an instant success. Britain had a half-penny rate to begin with.  The U.S. "penny postcard" rate lasted through 1951.
Presumably for the purpose of getting a prompt reply, a sender was given the opportunity to pay for postage both ways with an attached message-reply card, first introduced by Germany in 1873.  Other European countries quickly followed suit.  Spain furnished message-reply cards to her Colonies: Cuba (1880), Philippines (1889) and Puerto Rico (1898).Littrell, Robert, Ed.; Postal Cards of Spanish Colonial Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico, UPSS, 2010; ISBN 978-0-9800112-4-1   The U.S. issued them first in 1892. Message-reply cards were attached tête-bêche
and likely to be perforated or rouletted to facilitate separation once in the hands of the recipient.  The recipient could then tear them apart and use the prepaid reply card to correspond with the original sender. Normally the message card would be identical to the reply card except with the distinction of having additional language such as "WITH REPLY CARD" or "La otra tarjeta es para la respuesta" or "Carte Postale Résponse" or similar words to distinguish the two.  In the U.S., message and reply cards have been identical since 1968.
The term postal card is clearly differentiated from the term postcard which is a term to designate cards prepared by private companies and which do not have prepaid franking.  They are readily available at commercial outlets.  The addition of an adhesive stamp is required to mail them. They are frequently illustrated with pictures or printed advertisements. They are not considered postal stationery any more than a plain envelope or sheet of parcel wrapping are.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in Psychological Review.Maslow, A.H. (1943). A theory of human motivation. Psychological Review, 50(4), 370–96. Retrieved from http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans.  Maslow used the terms Physiological, Safety, Belongingness and Love, Esteem, Self-Actualization and Self-Transcendence needs to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.
Maslow studied what he called exemplary people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Douglass rather than mentally ill or neurotic people, writing that "the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy."[tpl]cite book|last=Maslow|first=A|title=Motivation and personality|publisher=Harper|location=New York, NY|year=1954|pages=236|isbn=0-06-041987-3[/tpl]

John Smith (c. January 1580 – 21 June 1631) Admiral of New England was an English soldier, explorer, and author. He was knighted for his services to Sigismund Bathory, Prince of Transylvania and his friend Mózes Székely. He was considered to have played an important part in the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was a leader of the Virginia Colony (based at Jamestown) between September 1608 and August 1609, and led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay. He was the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area and New England.
Smith's books and maps are considered extremely important in encouraging and supporting English colonisation of the New World. He gave the name New England to the region and noted: "Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land... If he have nothing but his hands, he may...by industrie quickly grow rich."David Cressy (1987). "Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century". p. 99. Cambridge University Press,
When Jamestown was England's first permanent settlement in the New World, Smith trained the settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated "he who shall not work, shall not eat". This strength of character and determination overcame problems presented from the hostile native Americans, the wilderness and the troublesome and uncooperative English settlers.[tpl]harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4[/tpl]  Harsh weather, lack of water, living in a swampy wilderness, English unwillingness to work, and attacks from the Powhatan nation almost destroyed the colony.

Freedom of information laws (FOI laws) allow access by the general public to data held by national governments. They establish a "right-to-know" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as open records, or sunshine laws (in the United States), governments are also typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but usually these are unused if specific support legislation does not exist.

John Winthrop (12 January 1587/8 – 26 March 1649) was a wealthy English Puritan lawyer and one of the leading figures in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the first major settlement in New England after Plymouth Colony.  Winthrop led the first large wave of migrants from England in 1630, and served as governor for 12 of the colony's first 20 years of existence.  His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan "city upon a hill" dominated New England colonial development, influencing the government and religion of neighboring colonies.
Born into a wealthy landowning and merchant family, Winthrop was trained in the law, and became Lord of the Manor at Groton in Suffolk.  Although he was not involved in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628, he became involved in 1629 when the anti-Puritan King Charles I began a crackdown on Nonconformist religious thought.  In October 1629 he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in April 1630 he led a group of colonists to the New World, founding a number of communities on the shores of Massachusetts Bay and the Charles River.
Between 1629 and his death in 1649, he served 12 annual terms as governor, and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative Thomas Dudley and the more liberal Roger Williams and Henry Vane.  Although Winthrop was a respected political figure, his attitude toward governance was somewhat authoritarian: he resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it "the meanest and worst of all forms of government". The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies, which were in some instances formed by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.
Winthrop's son, John, was one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony, and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period.  His long list of descendants includes famous Americans, and his writings continue to influence politicians today.

The Battle of Bunker Hill took place on June 17, 1775, mostly on and around Breed's Hill, during the Siege of Boston early in the American Revolutionary War. The battle is named after the adjacent Bunker Hill, which was peripherally involved in the battle and was the original objective of both colonial and British troops, and is occasionally referred to as the "Battle of Breed's Hill."
On June 13, 1775, the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British generals were planning to send troops out from the city to occupy the unoccupied hills surrounding the city. In response to this intelligence, 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill, constructed an earthen redoubt on Breed's Hill, and built lightly fortified lines across most of the Charlestown Peninsula.
When the British were alerted to the presence of the new position the next day, they mounted an attack against them. After two assaults on the colonial lines were repulsed with significant British casualties, the British finally captured the positions on the third assault, after the defenders in the redoubt ran out of ammunition. The colonial forces retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill, suffering their most significant losses on Bunker Hill.
While the result was a victory for the British, they suffered heavy losses: over 800 wounded and 226 killed, including a notably large number of officers. The battle is seen as an example of a Pyrrhic victory, because the immediate gain (the capture of Bunker Hill) was modest and did not significantly change the state of the siege, while the cost (the loss of nearly a third of the deployed forces) was high.  Meanwhile, colonial forces were able to retreat and regroup in good order having suffered fewer casualties. Furthermore, the battle demonstrated that relatively inexperienced colonial forces were willing and able to stand up to regular army troops in a pitched battle.

[[Niagara Bible Conference]]

CATEGORIES: Christian fundamentalism

The Niagara Bible Conference (officially called the "Believers' Meeting for Bible Study") was held annually from 1876 to 1897, with the exception of 1884.  In the first few years it met in different resort locations around the United States.  Starting in 1883, it was held in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario at the Queen's Royal Hotel and its pavilion.
The driving force behind the meeting was James H. Brookes, a Presbyterian minister from St. Louis.  Brookes publicized the meeting through his magazine Truth, and devoted substantial space to summaries of the speeches.
A typical example is his report from 1892, which describes the meeting as
"''more largely attended than ever before. Often every seat in the pavilion was occupied, and the porches were filled with eager hearers of the Word. The place too becomes more beautiful as the years go by, and it would be difficult to find a spot better suited"[tpl]Cite quote|date=July 2011[/tpl]
to the quiet and prayerful study of the Sacred Scriptures. The building in which the Conference meets, overlooking Lake Ontario and the River Niagara, and surrounded by green trees, is secluded from the noise of the world; and so excellent were the arrangements for the accommodation of the guests, both in Queen's Royal Hotel and in the boarding houses of the village, that not a word of complaint was heard from any one.''"Brookes, James H. in Truth, v. 17[tpl]Page needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
Most of the speakers were dispensationalists, and the Niagara Conference introduced many evangelical Protestants to dispensationalist teaching.  The messages generally centered on the doctrines of Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Bible, missions and prophecy.

In 1878, the Believers' Meeting for Bible Study produced the document that came to be known as the "Niagara Creed."  This 14-point statement of faith was one of the first to explicitly proclaim faith in the premillennial return of Jesus Christ to earth.  The Niagara Creed does not explicitly affirm dispensationalism, but it refers to several key dispensationalist beliefs, including the reality of the millennium, the restoration of Israel, and the distinction between the judgment of the saved and the damned.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]

[[Petition of Right]]
CATEGORIES: 1628 in law, 1628 in England, 17th century in England, Acts of the Parliament of England, Acts of the Parliament of England still in force, Constitutional laws of England, Constitution of the United Kingdom

The Petition of Right is a major English constitutional document that sets out specific liberties of the subject that the king is prohibited from infringing. Passed on 7 June 1628, the Petition contains restrictions on non-Parliamentary taxation, forced billeting of soldiers, imprisonment without cause, and restricts the use of martial law. Following disputes between Parliament and King Charles I over the execution of the Thirty Years' War, Parliament refused to grant subsidies to support the war effort, leading to Charles gathering "forced loans" without Parliamentary approval and arbitrarily imprisoning those who refused to pay. Moreover, the war footing of the nation led to the forced billeting of soldiers within the homes of private citizens, and the declaration of martial law over large swathes of the country.
In response, the House of Commons prepared a set of four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it was passed by the Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.
Despite debates over its legal status, the Petition of Right was highly influential. Domestically, the Petition is seen as "one of England's most famous constitutional documents",[tpl]sfn|Flemion|1973|p=193[/tpl] of equal value to the Magna Carta and Bill of Rights 1689. In a period in which Charles's main protection from the Commons was the House of Lords, the willingness of both chambers to work together marked a new stage in the constitutional crisis that would eventually lead to the English Civil War. The Petition remains in force in the United Kingdom and, thanks to Imperial legislation, many parts of the Commonwealth of Nations including Australia and New Zealand. Internationally, it helped influence the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, and is seen as a predecessor to the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh amendments to the Constitution of the United States.

Bet.com. 2007-11-19 (September 7, 1963 – March 26, 1995), better known by his stage name Eazy-E, was an American rapper who performed solo and in the hip hop group N.W.A. Wright is affectionately called "The Godfather of Gangsta Rap". He was born to Richard and Kathie Wright in Compton, California. After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before investing in Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper. When Ruthless artist Ice Cube wrote "Boyz-n-the-Hood", Dr. Dre, Cube, and Eazy formed N.W.A. After DJ Yella, MC Ren, and Arabian Prince joined the group, N.W.A released N.W.A. and the Posse. In 1988, they released their most controversial album, Straight Outta Compton. The group released two more albums and then disbanded after Eazy released Dr. Dre from his contract.
Eazy's main influences included 1970s funk groups, contemporary rappers, and comedians. When reviewing Eazy's albums, many critics noted his unique overall style, with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide summing up: "While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest, his distinctive delivery (invariably described as a high-pitched whine), over-the-top lyrics, and undeniable charisma made him a star."

[[Randomized controlled trial]]

A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial;[tpl]Cite journal | author = Chalmers TC, Smith H Jr, Blackburn B, Silverman B, Schroeder B, Reitman D, Ambroz A | title = A method for assessing the quality of a randomized control trial | journal = Controlled Clinical Trials | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–49 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(81)90056-8 | pmid = 7261638 [/tpl] RCT) is a specific type of scientific experiment, and the gold standard for a clinical trial. RCTs are often used to test the efficacy or effectiveness of various types of medical intervention within a patient population. RCTs may also provide an opportunity to gather useful information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. 
The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, and follow-up calls, should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared.  The most important advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = Br Med J | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 [/tpl]
The terms "RCT" and randomized trial are sometimes used synonymously, but the methodologically sound practice is to reserve the "RCT" name only for trials that contain control groups, in which  groups receiving the experimental treatment are compared with control groups receiving no treatment (a placebo-controlled study) or a previously tested treatment (a positive-control study). The term "randomized trials" omits mention of controls and can describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other (in the absence of a control group).[tpl]Cite journal | author = Ranjith G | title = Interferon-α-induced depression: when a randomized trial is not a randomized controlled trial | journal = Psychother Psychosom | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | page = 387 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1159/000087787 | pmid = 16244516 [/tpl] Similarly, although the "RCT" name is sometimes expanded as "randomized clinical trial" or "randomized comparative trial", the methodologically sound practice, to avoid ambiguity in the scientific literature, is to retain "control" in the definition of "RCT" and thus reserve that name only for trials that contain controls. Not all randomized clinical trials are randomized controlled trials (and some of them could never be, in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to institute). The term randomized controlled clinical trials is a methodologically sound alternate expansion for "RCT" in RCTs that concern clinical research;[tpl]Cite journal | author = Peto R, Pike MC, Armitage P, Breslow NE, Cox DR, Howard SV, Mantel N, McPherson K, Peto J, Smith PG | title = Design and analysis of randomized clinical trials requiring prolonged observation of each patient.

Assault weapon is a political and legal term that refers to different types of firearms, and that has differing meanings, usages and purposes. Whether or not assault weapons should be legally restricted more than other firearms, how they should be defined, and even whether or not the term "assault weapon" should be used at all, are questions subject to considerable debate.[tpl]cite news |title=Even Defining 'Assault Rifles' Is Complicated |author=Goode, Erica |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/even-defining-assault-weapons-is-complicated.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 18, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=What Is an Assault Weapon? |author=Lallanilla, Marc |url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/17/what-is-assault-weapon/ |work=Fox News |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Assault Weapons: What Are They, and Should They Be Banned? |author=Richman, Josh |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22396050/assault-weapons-what-are-they-and-should-they |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Is It Fair to Call Them 'Assault Weapons'? |author=Blake, Aaron |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/17/is-it-fair-to-call-them-assault-weapons/ |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Media Myths on 'Assault Weapons' and 'Semiautomatic Firearms' |author=Carney, Timothy P. |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/media-myths-on-assault-weapons-and-semiautomatic-firearms/article/2516156 |newspaper=Washington Examiner |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=January 3, 2013[/tpl] 
In discussions about firearms laws and politics in the U.S., assault weapon definitions usually include semi-automatic firearms with a detachable magazine and one or more cosmetic, ergonomic, or safety features, such as a flash suppressor,  pistol grip, or barrel shroud, respectively. Semi-automatic firearms fire and reload only one bullet (round) per trigger pull.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mantel |first=Barbara |date=March 8, 2013 |title=Gun Control |url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Gun-Control-v23-10.html |journal=CQ Researcher |publisher=CQ Press |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=233-256 |doi= |accessdate=December 3, 2013[/tpl] Assault weapon definitions include rifles, pistols and shotguns.[tpl]cite news |last=Levs |first=Josh |date=January 31, 2013 |title=Loaded language poisons gun debate |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/31/politics/gun-language/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 31, 2013 [/tpl] Some firearms are specified by name. In 2013 in Colorado, some gun rights advocates said that a proposed high-capacity magazine ban would effectively make assault weapons of pump shotguns because they can be altered to hold more than eight shells - the proposed state limit for shotguns.[tpl]cite news |last=Richardson |first=Valerie |date=March 3, 2013 |title=Pump shotgun on banned list doesn’t sit well with Colorado hunters |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/3/pump-shotgun-on-banned-list-doesnt-sit-well-with-c/ |newspaper=Washington Times |location= |publisher=Washington Times |accessdate=March 13, 2014 [/tpl]
The exact definition of the term in this context varies among each of the various jurisdictions limiting or prohibiting assault weapon manufacture, importation, sale, or possession, and legislative attempts are often made to change the definitions.  Governing and defining laws include the now defunct Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3355enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr3355enr.pdf |title=Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, H.R.3355 |author=103rd Congress |year=1994 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=201–215 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl] At that time, the U.S. Justice Department said, "In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use." State and local laws, sometimes modeled after the expired federal law, also define the term.
It has been asserted that the term is a media invention or a term that was intended by gun control activists to foster confusion with the public over differences between full automatic and semi-automatic firearms, while others argue that the term was promulgated by the firearms industry itself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/hosesix.htm |title=Bullet Hoses: Semiautomatic Assault Weapons—What Are They? What's So Bad About Them? |author= |year=2003 |publisher=Violence Policy Center |location=Washington, D.C. |at=The Gun Industry's Lies[/tpl]
The term "assault weapon" is sometimes conflated with the term "assault rifle" which refers only to military rifles capable of switching between semi-automatic and fully automatic fire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/39165/assault-rifle |title="Assault rifle." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Jul. 2010 |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl]  In the U.S., fully automatic firearms are regulated by laws such as the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA), which requires that they be registered and taxed, and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, as well as by state and local laws.
The term "assault weapon" is used to refer to anti-tank or anti-material explosive based weapons that are used by the military, such as the Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) portable rocket launcher.

General John Burgoyne (24 February 1722 – 4 August 1792) was a British army officer, politician and dramatist. He first saw action during the Seven Years' War when he participated in several battles, mostly notably during the Portugal Campaign of 1762.
Burgoyne is best known for his role in the American Revolutionary War  He designed an invasion scheme and was appointed to command a force moving south from Canada to split away New England and end the rebellion.  Burgoyne advanced from Canada but his slow movement allowed the Americans to concentrate their forces.  Instead of coming to his aid according to the overall plan, the British Army in New York City moved south to capture Philadelphia. Surrounded, Burgoyne fought two small battles near Saratoga to break out.  Trapped by superior American forces, with no relief in sight, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army of 6200 men on October 17, 1777.  His surrender, says historian Edmund Morgan, "was a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory. Edmund Morgan, The Birth of the Republic: 1763-1789 (1956)  pp 82-83   He and his officers returned to England; the enlisted men became prisoners of war. Burgoyne came under sharp criticism when he returned to London, and never held another active command.
Burgoyne was also an accomplished playwright known for his works such as The Maid of the Oaks and The Heiress, but his plays never reached the fame of his military career. He served as a member of the House of Commons of Parliament for a number of years, sitting for the seats of Midhurst and Preston. He is often referred to as Gentleman Johnny.

Madison Avenue is a north-south avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, United States, that carries northbound one-way traffic. It runs from Madison Square (at 23rd Street) to the Madison Avenue Bridge at 138th Street. In doing so, it passes through Midtown, the Upper East Side (including Carnegie Hill), Spanish Harlem, and Harlem. It is named after and arises from Madison Square, which is itself named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States. Since the 1920s, the street's name has been synonymous with the American advertising industry.
Madison Avenue was not part of the original New York City street grid established in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and was carved between Park Avenue (formerly Fourth) and Fifth Avenue in 1836, due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B. Ruggles, a graduate of Yale University who had previously purchased and developed New York's Gramercy Park in 1831, who was in part responsible for the development of Union Square, and who also named Lexington Avenue.

[[John Hench]]

CATEGORIES: 1908 births, 2004 deaths, Deaths from myocardial infarction, American animators, People from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Otis College of Art and Design alumni, Disney people

John Hench (June 29, 1908 – February 5, 2004) was an employee of The Walt Disney Company for more than 65 years, during which saw the creation of nearly every Disney animated feature and theme park.
Born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Hench attended numerous art and creative schools across the country, including the Art Students League of New York, the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Art Institute in San Francisco, and the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles.
Starting in 1939 as a story artist, he weaved his way through the animation department working in areas including backgrounds, layout and art direction, effects animation and special effects. Hench was respected by Walt Disney as one of the studio's most gifted artists and teamed him with Salvador Dalí on the animated short Destino, a project begun in 1945 that was not completed and released until 2003. Hench was also Disney's "official portrait artist" of Mickey Mouse, painting the company's portraits for Mickey's 25th, 50th, 60th, 70th, and 75th birthdays. 
By 1954, Hench was in the studio's live action department, as lead developer of the hydraulic giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, helping to win an Academy Award for Best Special Effects for the film.
Afterward, he moved to WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering), to design attractions for Disneyland. Hench went on to design many iconic elements for Disney's theme parks, including Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, Space Mountain, and contributed to attractions such as the Mickey Mouse Revue.
Because of his resemblance to Walt Disney and his frequent visits to Disney theme parks, he was often asked to sign autographs and pose for pictures with park visitors who mistook Hench for Disney himself.
One of Hench's most recognizable works is his design for the Olympic Torch for the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California, modeled after the torches of the 1948 and 1956 Olympiads.BBC
After realising that the 52 cm tall torch wasn't stable when filled with fuel, he made it slightly smaller in height and added black tape to the top part of the shaft, as it was easier for the runners to pass the torch when held near the top. In an interview, one runner mentioned that carrying the torch under the bowl made more sense than at the distal length. "It swung too much and was in your face. A short grasp was expedient!"[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Hench and his wife were longtime devotees of the Hindu saint Ramakrishna and members of the Vedanta Society of Southern California.
In 1990, he received the Disney Legend award, the company's highest honor, presented to him by Michael Eisner.
Hench continued to maintain an office at Walt Disney Imagineering headquarters in Glendale, California and worked there daily up until a few weeks before his death. His name tag and 65-year service award are prominently displayed in the building's lobby, and tributes by fellow Imagineers line its hallways.
Hench died of heart failure in early 2004 after a brief hospitalization in Burbank, California.

Geopolitics, from Greek Γη (earth) and Πολιτική (politics), is the study of the effects of geography (both human and physical) on international politics and international relations.Devetak et al (eds), An Introduction to International Relations, 2012, p. 492. Geopolitics is a method of foreign policy analysis which seeks to understand, explain, and predict international political behaviour primarily in terms of geographical variables. Typical geographical variables are the physical location, size, climate, topography, demography, natural resources, and technological advances of the state being evaluated.Evans, G & Newnham, J., (1998), "The Penguin Dictionary of International relations", Penguin Books, London, Uk. ISBN 0-14-051397-3 Traditionally, the term has applied primarily to the impact of geography on politics, but its usage has evolved over the past century to encompass wider connotations.
Geopolitics traditionally studies the links between political power and geographic space, and examines strategic prescriptions based on the relative importance of land power and sea power in world history. The geopolitical tradition had some consistent concerns with geopolitical correlations of power in world politics, the identification of international core areas, and the relationships between naval and terrestrial capabilities.Oyvind Osterud, "The Uses and Abuses of Geopolitics", "Journal of Peace Research'', no. 2, 1988, p. 192. Academically, the study of geopolitics analyses geography, history, and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales. Also, the study of geopolitics includes the study of the ensemble of relations between the interests of international political actors, interests focused to an area, space, geographical element or ways, relations which create a geopolitical system.Vladimir Toncea, 2006, "Geopolitical evolution of borders in Danube Basin" Geopolitics is multidisciplinary in scope, and includes all aspects of the social sciences—with particular emphasis on political geography, international relations, the territorial aspects of political science and international law.Geopolitics Journal home page The practice directly and indirectly impacts businesses and economies.Munoz, J.Mark.2013. The Handbook of the Geopolitics of Business, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing
The term "Geopolitics" was coined at the beginning of the twentieth century by Rudolf Kjellén, a Swedish political scientist, who was inspired by the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel. Ratzel published Politische Geographie (political geography) in 1897; that book was later popularized in English by the Austro-Hungarian historian Emil Reich and the American diplomat Robert Strausz-Hupé (a faculty member of the University of Pennsylvania). Although Halford Mackinder had a pioneering role in the field, he never used the term geopolitics himself.Kearns, Gerry. 2009. Geopolitics and Empire, Oxford: Oxford University Press.

The 1960 Winter Olympics was a winter multi-sport event held between February 18–28, 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States. Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US$80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each. Swedish cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games.
Cold War politics forced the IOC to debate the participation of China, Taiwan, North Korea and East Germany. In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to athletes from Communist countries. The IOC responded with a threat to revoke Squaw Valley's right to host the 1960 Games. The United States conceded and allowed entry to athletes from Communist countries.

[tpl]Good article[/tpl][tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series, written by J. K. Rowling. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are followed by attacks which leave residents of the school "petrified" (frozen like stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger investigate the attacks.
The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result of the person's choices.
Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became the third film to exceed £600 million in international box office sales and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

[[Mirror galvanometer]]
CATEGORIES: Galvanometers, Optical instruments

A mirror galvanometer is an electromechanical instrument that senses electric current by deflecting a light beam with a mirror.  The beam of light projected on a scale acts as a long massless pointer.  In 1826, Johann Christian Poggendorff developed the mirror galvanometer for detecting electric currents. The apparatus is also known as a spot galvanometer after the spot of light produced in some models.
Mirror galvanometers were used extensively in scientific instruments before reliable, stable electronic amplifiers were available.  The most common uses were as recording equipment for seismometers and submarine cables used for telegraphy.
In modern times, the term mirror galvanometer is also used for devices that move laser beams by rotating a mirror through a galvanometer set-up. The name is often abbreviated as galvo.

All in the Family is an American sitcom that was originally broadcast on the CBS television network from January 12, 1971, to April 8, 1979. In September 1979, a new show, Archie Bunker's Place, picked up where All in the Family had ended. That sitcom lasted another four years, ending its run in 1983.
Produced by Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, the original pilot was entitled Justice for All and was developed for ABC. Tom Bosley, Jack Warden, and Jackie Gleason were all considered for the role of Archie Bunker. In fact, CBS wanted to buy the rights to the original British show Till Death Us Do Part and retool it specifically for Gleason, who was under contract to them, but producer Norman Lear beat out CBS for the rights and offered the show to ABC.
In the pilot, Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton played Archie and Edith Justice. Kelly Jean Peters played Gloria and Tim McIntire played her husband, Richard. It was taped in October 1968 in New York City. After screening the first pilot, ABC gave the producers more money to shoot a second pilot entitled Those Were the Days, which was taped in February 1969 in Hollywood. Candice Azzara played Gloria and Chip Oliver played Richard. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson in both pilots. After ABC turned down the second pilot, CBS developed the third pilot, entitled All in the Family. This pilot had the final cast and was the series' first episode.
All in the Family revolved around the life of a working class bigot and his family. Despite being considerably softer in its approach than its BBC predecessor, Till Death Us Do Part, the show broke ground in its depiction of issues previously considered unsuitable for U.S. network television comedy, such as racism, homosexuality, women's liberation, rape, miscarriage, abortion, breast cancer, the Vietnam War, menopause, and impotence. Through depicting these controversial issues, the series became arguably one of television's most influential comedic programs, as it injected the sitcom format with real-life conflicts.All in the Family TV Show - Videos, Actors, Photos and Episodes from the Classic Television Show
The show ranked number-one in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It became the first television series to reach the milestone of having topped the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive years, a mark later matched by The Cosby Show and surpassed by American Idol, which notched eight consecutive seasons at #1.

[[Chinese name]]

CATEGORIES: Names by culture, Chinese language

Chinese personal names ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|姓名[/tpl] |p=xìng míng |j=sing3 ming4[/tpl]) are the names adopted by those from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and the Chinese diaspora overseas. They arose from the culture of the Han people. In some cases, the term may also refer to Chinese names adopted by or used to refer to people from other areas.
Chinese names typically consist of three syllables[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]a monosyllabic family name and a disyllabic given name[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]with each syllable having a particular tone and being written as a single Chinese character. About one in seven people have a two-syllable name, and fewer than one-fifth of one percent[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]many of them ethnic minoritiesThe Xinhua Net article "我国汉族公民最长姓名达15字" (op. cit.) reported that in 2007 97% of all Chinese names longer than 10 characters were held by citizens living in Xinjiang.[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]have a name of four or more syllables; most Han Chinese that have names longer than four characters have compound surnames (e.g. Ouyang Kunpeng or Da-Hong Seetoo).Xinhua Net. "我国汉族公民最长姓名达15字 公安部：起名不规范会有不便". 12 Dec 2007. Accessed 16 Mar 2012. [tpl]zh icon[/tpl]
Chinese names use the Eastern name order, where the family name precedes the given name. A boy called Wai ([tpl]linktext|衛[/tpl]) and belonging to the Cheung ([tpl]linktext|張[/tpl]) family[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]currently China's most common single nameBeijing News. "一个“张伟”找到29万人". 26 Jul 2007. Accessed 16 Mar 2012. [tpl]zh icon[/tpl][tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]is called "Cheung Wai" and not "Wai Cheung" (unless he's travelling abroad). It is standard for the Chinese to address one another[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]especially those with two-character names[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]by using full names. So normally, Cheung Wai would be formally addressed as "Mr. Cheung" and informally as "Cheung Wai" – never as "Wai Cheung" or "Mr. Wai".
The two halves of the name are almost always treated as indivisible units. There is no equivalent of English middle names, which are both official and generally ignored. [tpl]linktext|王|秀英[/tpl][tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]currently China's most common three-character name[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]might be called "Wong Sau Ying" or simply "Sau Ying", but no one would ever say "Wong Sau" or "Wong Ying" and omit the other half of her given name.
Chinese people interacting with others who do not know characters romanize their names in a variety of ways, although Hanyu Pinyin is now the standard in both mainland China and Taiwan. Many also adopt a European-style name (typically English), either by reversing the Chinese order or by choosing a new name entirely. For instance, family members with given Chinese names of "Kwan Chang Shing" and "Kwan Yo Hong", may reverse the order to "Chang Shing Kwan" and "Yo Hong Kwan", or may adopt westernized names such as "Priscilla" and "Cailyn". In Hong Kong, a common practice is to combine both English and Chinese names into a single hybrid.
From at least the time of the Shang dynasty, the Han Chinese observed a number of naming taboos regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]particularly emperors[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were not infrequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the May Fourth Movement has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.

[[Semaphore line]]
CATEGORIES: History of telecommunications, Latin-alphabet representations, Napoleonic Beacons in England, Optical communications, Telegraphy

A semaphore telegraph, optical telegraph, shutter telegraph chain, Chappe telegraph, or Napoleonic semaphore is a system of conveying information by means of visual signals, using towers with pivoting shutters, also known as blades or paddles. Information is encoded by the position of the mechanical elements; it is read when the shutter is in a fixed position.
The system was invented in 1792 in France by Claude Chappe, and was popular in the late 18th to early 19th century.Chapter 2: Semaphore Signalling ISBN 978-0-86341-327-8 Communications: an international history of the formative years R. W. Burns, 2004Telegraph Vol 10, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 6th Edition, 1824 pp. 645–651Telegraph, Volume 17 of The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, pp. 664–667, 1832 David Brewster, ed.
Semaphore lines were a precursor of the electrical telegraph. They were far faster than post riders for bringing a message over long distances, but far more expensive and less private than the electrical telegraph lines which would replace them. The distance that an optical telegraph can bridge is limited by geography and weather; thus, in practical use, most optical telegraphs used lines of relay stations to bridge longer distances.
Modern derivatives of the semaphore system include flag semaphore (a flag relay system) and the heliograph (optical telegraphy using mirror-directed sunlight reflections).

[[Principality of Hutt River]]
CATEGORIES: Micronations in Australia, Mid West (Western Australia), Secession in Australia, Monarchy in Australia, 1972 establishments in Australia

The Principality of Hutt River, previously known as the Hutt River Province, is the oldest micronation in Australia. The principality claims to be an independent sovereign state and to have achieved legal status on 21 April 1972, although it remains unrecognised by Australia or other nations.
The principality is located 517 km (354 mi) north of Perth, near the town of Northampton in the state of Western Australia. If considered independent, it is an enclave of Australia. The principality was founded on 21 April 1970 by Leonard George Casley, who styles himself as "Prince Leonard", when he and his associates proclaimed their secession from Western Australia.

The Free State Project (FSP) is a political migration, founded in 2001, to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, selected in 2003) in order to make the state a stronghold for libertarian ideas.[tpl]cite news |title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all |first=Pam |last=Belluck |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 27, 2003 |accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl] The project seeks to overcome the historical ineffectiveness of limited-government activism which they believe was caused by the small number and diffuse population of libertarian activists across the 50 United States and around the world.

Peter Edward "Ginger" Baker (born 19 August 1939 in Lewisham, South London) is an English drummer, best known for his work with the rock band Cream. He is also known for his numerous associations with World music, mainly the use of African influences.[tpl]cite book|title=Hellraiser The autobiography of the World's Most Famous Drummer|author=Baker, Ginger and Ginette|publisher=John Blake Publishing[/tpl] He has also had other collaborations such as with Blind Faith, Gary Moore, Hawkwind, Masters of Reality and Public Image Ltd.
Baker's drumming attracted attention for its flamboyance, showmanship and his use of two bass drums instead of the conventional single bass kick drum (following a similar set-up used by Louie Bellson during his days with Duke Ellington). Although a firmly established rock drummer and praised as "Rock's first superstar drummer",[tpl]cite web| url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3618|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Ginger Baker|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl] he prefers being called a jazz drummer.[ref]

AllMusic has described him as "the most influential percussionist of the 1960s" and stated that "virtually every drummer of every heavy metal band that has followed since that time has sought to emulate some aspect of Baker's playing." 
While at times performing in a similar way to Keith Moon from The Who, Baker also employs a more restrained style influenced by the British jazz groups he heard during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In his early days as a drummer, he performed lengthy drum solos, the best known being the five-minute drum solo "Toad" from Cream's debut album Fresh Cream (1966). He is also noted for using a variety of other percussion instruments and for his application of African rhythms. He would often emphasize the flam, a drum rudiment in which both sticks attack the drumhead at almost the same time, giving a heavy thunderous sound.

Saint Philomena was, as believed by her devotees within the Catholic Church, a young virgin martyr whose remains were discovered in 1802 in the Catacombs of Priscilla. Three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription that was taken to indicate that her name (in the Latin of the inscription) was Filumena, the English form of which is Philomena.
The remains were removed to Mugnano del Cardinale in 1805 and became the focus of widespread devotion, with several miracles credited to the saint's intercession, including the healing of Venerable Pauline Jaricot in 1835, which received wide publicity. Saint John Vianney attributed to her intercession the extraordinary cures that others attributed to himself.
In 1833 a Neapolitan nun reported that in a vision Saint Philomena had revealed that she was a Greek princess martyred at 13 years of age by Diocletian, who was Roman Emperor from 284 to 305.
From 1837 to 1961 celebration of her liturgical feast was approved for some places, but was never included in the General Roman Calendar for universal use. The 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal included a mention of her, under 11 August, in the section headed Missae pro aliquibus locis (Masses for some places), with an indication that the Mass to be used in those places was one from the common of a Virgin Martyr, without any collect proper to the saint.1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal, with feasts updated to the late 1920s, p. 214: "11 August. St Philomena. Virgin and Martyr. Mass: Loquebar from the Common of Virgins, 1."
On 14 February 1961, the Holy See ordered that the name of Saint Philomena be removed from all liturgical calendars that mentioned her.Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 1961, p. 174. The text can be consulted on the website of the Holy See. It is also available at Instruction De calendariis particularibus (1961) together with a French translation and a note that recounts the history of the devotion and that says a different saint named Philomena (5 July) and two called Philomenus (14 November and 29 November) were listed in the Roman Martyrology, in which this Philomena never appeared. Accordingly, the 1962 Roman Missal, the edition whose continued use as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite is authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, also has no mention of her.1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal (searchable)
The shrine of her relics in Mugnano del Cardinale continues to be visited by pilgrimages from many countries, an Archconfraternity in her honour exists, as does popular devotion in various places around the world.

Saints  Perpetua and Felicity (believed to have died 203) are Christian martyrs of the 3rd century. Perpetua  was a  married noblewoman, said to have been 22 years old at the time of her death, and mother of an infant she was nursing.  Felicity, her slave and pregnant at the time, was martyred with her. They were put to death along with others at Carthage in the Roman province of Africa.
The Passion of St. Perpetua, St. Felicitas, and their Companions is one of the oldest and most notable early Christian texts. It survives in both Latin and Greek forms, and purports to contain the actual prison diary of the young mother and martyr Perpetua. Scholars generally believe that it is authentic although in the form we have it may have been edited by others. The text also purports to contain, in his own words, the accounts of the visions of Saturus, another Christian martyred with Perpetua. An editor who states he was an eyewitness has added accounts of the martyrs' suffering and deaths. 
According to the passion, a slave named Revocatus, his fellow slave Felicitas, the two free men Saturninus and Seculdulus, and Perpetua, who were catechumens , that is, Christians being instructed in the faith but not yet baptized,were arrested and executed at the military games in celebration of the Emperor Geta's birthday. To this group was added a man named Saturus, who voluntarily went before the magistrate and proclaimed himself a Christian.

Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, literally The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966The first year given is the original publication date; the second is the year of English publication.), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and the monumental Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism.  His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.
Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world, among others in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.Kordić 2005, pp. 265–268. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.
Like many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career; over the course of his life, he has gradually moved from the political left towards liberalism or neoliberalism. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with the policies of the Cuban President. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right Frente Democrático (FREDEMO) coalition, advocating neoliberal reforms, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. He is the person who, in 1990, "coined the phrase that circled the globe",[tpl]sfn|Terra|2010[/tpl] declaring on Mexican television, "Mexico is the perfect dictatorship", a statement which became an adage during the following decade.

It has been estimated that Trujillo's tyrannical rule was responsible for the death of more than 50,000 people, including 20,000 to 30,000 in the infamous Parsley Massacre.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2010/2/26/34938/Protest-aborts-Dominican-tyrants-daughters-book-debut | author=Dominican Today | title=Protest aborts Dominican tyrant's daughter's book debut. | date=February 26, 2010 | accessdate= December 8, 2010[/tpl]
The Trujillo tyranny unfolded in a Latin American environment that was particularly fertile for dictatorial regimes.Jésus de Galindez points out in the introduction of his book La Era de Trujillo that "In this summer of 1955, half the Latin American republics are ruled by dictatorships, most of them of the military type".Jésus de Galindez, L'Ère de Trujillo, Gallimard, Paris, 1962, p. 15 (Translation of La Era de Trujillo, Santiago de Chile, 1956 In the countries of the Caribbean basin alone, his dictatorship was concurrent, in whole or in part, with those of Machado and Batista and Fidel Castro in Cuba, the two Somozas (Anastasio Somoza Garcia and Anastasio Somoza Debayle) in Nicaragua, Ubico and Castillo Armas in Guatemala, Hernández Martínez in Salvador, Carías Andino in Honduras, Juan Vicente Gómez and Pérez Jiménez in Venezuela, Laureano Gómez and Rojas Pinilla in Colombia, and François Duvalier in Haiti. But in retrospect, the Trujillo dictatorship has been characterized as more naked, more achieved, and more brutal than those that rose and fell around it.Lauro Capdevilla, La dictature de Trujillo, République dominicaine, 1930-1961, L'Harmattan, Paris, Montreal 1998, p. 10.
Trujillo's rule brought the country more stability and prosperity than any living Dominican had previously known. The price, however, was high — civil liberties were nonexistent and human rights violations were routine. Due to the longevity of Trujillo's rule, a detached evaluation of his legacy is difficult. Supporters of Trujillo claim that he reorganized both the state and the economy, and left vast infrastructure to the country. His detractors point to the brutality of his rule, and also claim that much of the country's wealth wound up in the hands of his family or close associates.

The project aims at ensuring a viable population of Bengal tigers in their natural habitats and also to protect them from extinction, and preserving areas of biological importance as a natural heritage forever represented as close as possible the diversity of ecosystems across the tiger's distribution in the country. The project's task force visualized these tiger reserves as breeding nuclei, from which surplus animals would migrate to adjacent forests. Funds and commitment were mastered to support the intensive program of habitat protection and rehabilitation under the project.Panwar, H. S.

During the tiger census of 2006, a new methodology was used extrapolating site-specific densities of tigers, their co-predators and prey derived from camera trap and sign surveys using GIS. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger population has been estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age.[tpl]cite book |title=Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and Prey in India |author=Jhala, Y.

Leon Festinger (8 May 1919 – 11 February 1989) was an American social psychologist, perhaps best known for cognitive dissonance and social comparison theory. His theories and research are credited with repudiating the previously dominant behaviorist view of social psychology by demonstrating the inadequacy of stimulus-response conditioning accounts of human behavior.Zukier, 1989, p. xv Festinger is also credited with advancing the use of laboratory experimentation in social psychology,Zukier, 1991, p. xiv although he simultaneously stressed the importance of studying real-life situations,Festinger, 1953, pp. 169–170. a principle he perhaps most famously practiced when personally infiltrating a doomsday cult. He is also known in social network theory for the proximity effect (or propinquity).Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950
Festinger studied psychology under Kurt Lewin, an important figure in modern social psychology, at the University of Iowa, graduating in 1941.American, 1959, p. 784 However, he did not develop an interest in social psychology until after joining the faculty at Lewin’s Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1945.Festinger, 1980, p. 237 Despite his preeminence in social psychology, Festinger turned to visual perception research in 1964 and then archaeology and history in 1979 until his death in 1989.Aronson, 1991, p. 216

[[Directed verdict]]
CATEGORIES: Civil procedure, Criminal procedure

In a jury trial, a directed verdict is an order from the presiding judge to the jury to return a particular verdict.  Typically, the judge orders a directed verdict after finding that no reasonable jury could reach a decision to the contrary. After a directed verdict, there is no longer any need for the jury to decide the case.  
A judge may order a directed verdict as to an entire case or only to certain issues.
In a criminal case in the United States, once the prosecution has closed its case, the defendant may move for a directed verdict.  If granted, the verdict will be "not guilty".  The prosecution may never seek a directed verdict of guilty, as the defendant has a constitutional right to present a defense and rebut the prosecution's case and have a jury determine guilt or innocence (where a defendant has waived his/her right to a jury trial and allowed the judge to render the verdict, this still applies).
In a civil action, a related concept to the directed verdict is that of a non-suit.  
This concept has largely been replaced in the American legal system with judgment as a matter of law.

John Le Mesurier (pron. "measurer",[tpl]sfn|McCann|2010|p=2[/tpl] born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley; 5 April 1912[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]15 November 1983) was an English actor. He is perhaps best remembered for his comedic role as Sergeant Arthur Wilson in the BBC television situation comedy Dad's Army (1968–77). A self-confessed "jobbing actor", Le Mesurier appeared in more than 120 films across a range of genres, normally in smaller supporting parts.
Le Mesurier became interested in the stage as a young adult and enrolled at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art in 1933. From there he took a position in repertory theatre and made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh in the J. B. Priestley play Dangerous Corner. He later accepted an offer to work with Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of Hamlet. He first appeared on television in 1938 as Seigneur de Miolans in the BBC broadcast of The Marvellous History of St Bernard. During the Second World War Le Mesurier was posted to British India, as a captain with the Royal Tank Regiment. He returned to acting and made his film debut in 1948, starring in the second feature comedy short Death in the Hand, opposite Esme Percy and Ernest Jay. He undertook a number of roles on television in 1951 including Educating Archie alongside Tony Hancock.
Le Mesurier had a prolific film career, appearing mostly in comedies, usually in roles portraying figures of authority such as army officers, policemen and judges. As well as Hancock's Half Hour, Le Mesurier appeared in Hancock's two principal films, The Rebel and The Punch and Judy Man. In 1971 Le Mesurier received his only award: a British Academy of Film and Television Arts "Best Television Actor" award for his lead performance in Dennis Potter's television play Traitor; it was one of the few lead roles he played during the course of his career.
He took a relaxed approach to acting and felt that his parts were those of "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".[tpl]sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=72[/tpl] Le Mesurier was married three times, most notably to the actress Hattie Jacques. A heavy drinker of alcohol for most of his life, Le Mesurier died in 1983, aged 71, from a stomach haemorrhage, brought about by a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. After his death, critics reflected that, for an actor who normally took minor roles, the viewing public were "enormously fond of him".

[[Payphone]]

CATEGORIES: Public phones, American inventions, Vending, Street furniture, 1889 introductions

A payphone (alternative spelling: pay phone) is typically a coin-operated public telephone, often located in a telephone booth or a privacy hood, with pre-payment by inserting money (usually coins) or by billing a credit, debit card, or a telephone card. Prepaid Calling Cards also facilitate establishing a call by first calling the provided Toll-free telephone number, entering the card account number and pin, then the desired connection telephone number - also offering the benefit of establishing many telephone number connections during a single payphone session. An equipment usage fee may be charged as additional units, minutes or tarif fee to the collect/third-party, debit, credit, telephone or prepaid calling card when used at payphones.
Payphones are often found in public places, transportation hubs such as airports or train stations, convenience stores, malls, casinos, and on street corners.  By agreement with the landlord, either the phone company pays rent for the location and keeps the revenue, or the landlord pays rent for the phone and shares the revenue.  Some payphones, particularly at gas stations, are mounted in drive-up kiosk structures that can be used without leaving the vehicle.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
Payphone revenues have sharply declined in many places, largely due to the increased usage of mobile phones. Payphone providers have sometimes tried to reverse the decline in usage by offering additional services such as SMS and Internet access, thus making their phone booths into Internet kiosks. The abandonment of payphones by telephone companies has angered some people who consider them a communication staple for low-income and low-credit consumers.

Diamond dust is a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. This meteorological phenomenon is also referred to simply as ice crystals and is reported in the METAR code as IC. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so it is sometimes referred to as clear-sky precipitation. It is most commonly observed in Antarctica and the Arctic, but it can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing. In Polar regions diamond dust may continue for several days without interruption.

Feeling is the nominalization of the verb to feel. The word was first used in the English language to describe the physical sensation of touch through either experience or perception. The word is also used to describe experiences other than the physical sensation of touch, such as "a feeling of warmth"feeling - Dictionary definition and pronunciation - Yahoo! Education and of sentience in general. In Latin, sentire meant to feel, hear or smell.
In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the conscious subjective experience of emotion.VandenBos, Gary (2006) APA Dictionary of Psychology. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association Phenomenology and heterophenomenology are philosophical approaches that provide some basis for knowledge of feelings. Many schools of psychotherapy depend on the therapist achieving some kind of understanding of the client's feelings, for which methodologies exist. Some theories of interpersonal relationships also have a role for shared feelings or understanding of another person's feelings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
Perception of the physical world does not necessarily result in a universal reaction among receivers (see emotions), but varies depending on one's tendency to handle the situation, how the situation relates to the receiver's past experiences, and any number of other factors. Feelings are also known as a state of consciousness, such as that resulting from emotions, sentiments or desires.

Mestizo ([tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɛ|ˈ|s|t|i|z|oʊ[/tpl];Mestizo. (2012). Dictionary.com. Retrieved January 1, 2012, from link Peninsular Spanish: [tpl]IPA-es|mesˈtiθo|[/tpl], Latin American Spanish: [tpl]IPA-es|mesˈtiso|[/tpl]) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish-speaking America to mean a person of  combined European and Native American descent. The term was used as a racial category in the Casta system that was in use during the Spanish empire's control of their American colonies.
To avoid confusion with the original usage of the term [tpl]lang|es|mestizo[/tpl], mixed-race people started to be referred collectively as [tpl]lang|es|castas[/tpl]. During the colonial period, mestizos quickly became the majority group in much of what is today the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America, and when the colonies started achieving independence from Spain, the mestizo group often became dominant. In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, the concept of the "mestizo" became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous and the word mestizo acquired its current double meaning of mixed cultural heritage and descent.
In colonial Venezuela, [tpl]lang|es|pardo[/tpl] was more commonly used instead of [tpl]lang|es|mestizo[/tpl]. [tpl]lang|es|Pardo[/tpl] means being mixed without specifying which admixture;http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/17.htm it was used to describe anyone born in the Americas whose ancestry was a mixture of European, Amerindian, and Black African.http://www.eldesafiodelahistoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=193:silvio-di-bernardo&catid=94:publicate&Itemid=129
In the Spanish colonial casta system mestizos/[tpl]lang|es|pardos[/tpl], who formed the majority, had fewer rights than the minority elite European-born persons called [tpl]lang|es|peninsulares[/tpl], and the minority white colonial-born whites [tpl]lang|es|criollo[/tpl], but more rights than the now minority [tpl]lang|es|indios[/tpl], [tpl]lang|es|negro[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|es|mulato[/tpl] populations.
In colonial Brazil, the Portuguese-speaking part of Latin America, most of the non-slave population (including the white one) was mestizo by the original Iberian definition of the word (mixed-race). There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class white landlord males and female slaves would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit the property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be the legitimate ones in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs).
In the Philippines, which was a colony of Spain, the term mestizo came to refer to person with European and Filipino ancestry.
In Canada, the Métis people is a community composed of those who possess combined European (usually French, sometimes Scottish or English) and North American Amerindian ancestry.
In Saint Barthélemy, the term mestizo refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl]

Hank Williams, Sr. ([tpl]IPAc-en|h|æ|ŋ|k|_|w|ɪ|l|j|əm|z|_[/tpl]; September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953), born Hiram King Williams, was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant country music artists, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that would place in the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one.
Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams moved to Georgiana, where he met Rufus Payne, a black street performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams's later musical style. During this time, Williams informally changed his name to Hank, believing it to be a better name for country music. He moved to Montgomery and his music career began there in 1937 when WSFA radio station producers hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career.
When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements and was dismissed by WSFA due to his alcoholism. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who managed the singer for nearly a decade. After recording "Never Again" and "Honky Tonkin'" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1948 he released "Move It on Over", which became a hit, and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. One year later, he released a cover of "Lovesick Blues", which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were "Your Cheatin' Heart", "Hey, Good Lookin'", and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry".
Several years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely deteriorated Williams's health; he divorced Audrey and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry, citing unreliability and frequent drunkenness. Williams died in the early morning hours of New Year's Day in 1953 at the age of 29 from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol. Despite his short life, Williams has had a major influence on twentieth-century popular music. The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists, and have been hits in various genres including pop, gospel, and blues.  He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

The Rite of Spring ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Le Sacre du printemps[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ru|link=no| «Весна священная», Vesna svyashchennaya[/tpl]) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky, with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation and a near-riot in the audience. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.
Stravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. The Rite was the third such project, after the acclaimed The Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911). The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, "Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts"; in the scenario, after various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Léonide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original. Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading ballet-masters, which gained the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.
Stravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. The music has influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers, and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.

Amazon parrot is the common name for a parrot of the genus Amazona. These are medium-size parrots native to the New World ranging from South America to Mexico and the Caribbean.
Most Amazon parrots are predominantly green, with accenting colors that depend on the species and can be quite vivid. They feed primarily on seeds, nuts, and fruits, supplemented by leafy matter.
Many Amazon parrots have a remarkable ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. Partly because of this they are popular as pets or companion parrots, and a small industry has developed in breeding parrots in captivity for this market. This popularity has led to many parrots being taken from the wild to the extent that some species have become threatened. CITES treaties have made trapping wild parrots for the pet trade illegal to protect wild populations.

The name 'League of Corinth' was invented by modern historians due to the first council of the League being in Corinth.

[[Kaiser]]

CATEGORIES: Holy Roman Emperors, German Empire, Heads of state, Royal titles, German noble titles, Titles of national or ethnic leadership

Kaiser is the German title meaning "emperor". Like the Russian Tsar it is directly derived from the Roman emperors' title of Caesar, which in turn is derived from the personal name of a branch of the gens (clan) Julia, to which Gaius Julius Caesar, the forebear of the first imperial family, belonged. Although the British monarchs styled "Emperor of India" were also called "Kaisar-i-Hind" in Hindi and Urdu, this word, although ultimately sharing the same Latin origin, is derived from the Greek kaisar, not the German Kaiser.Witzel, M. "Autochthonous Aryans? The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts", p. 29, 12.1 (as Urdu kaisar).
In English, the term the Kaiser is usually reserved for the emperors of the German Empire, the emperors of the Austrian Empire and those of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the First World War, the term the Kaiser—especially as applied to Wilhelm II of Germany—gained considerable pejorative connotations in English-speaking countries.

The Profumo family is of Italian origin, and John Profumo held the title of 5th Baron Profumo in the nobility of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Although Profumo held an increasingly responsible series of political posts in the 1950s, he is best known for his involvement in a scandal involving Christine Keeler in 1963. The scandal, which became known as the Profumo affair, led to his resignation and withdrawal from politics, and it may have helped to topple the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan.
After his resignation, Profumo began to work as a volunteer cleaning toilets at Toynbee Hall, a charity based in the East End of London, and continued to work there for the rest of his life.The Economist: The Profumo affair in context Eventually, he volunteered as the charity's chief fundraiser. These charitable activities helped to restore the fallen politician's reputation; he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1975, and in 1995 was invited to Margaret Thatcher's 70th birthday dinner.

Leon Spinks (born July 11, 1953) is an American former boxer, who had an overall record of 26 wins, 17 losses and three draws as a professional, with 14 of those wins by knockout. In only his eighth professional bout, Spinks won the undisputed world heavyweight championship when he beat Muhammad Ali on February 15, 1978, in what was considered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, he was stripped of the WBC title for fighting Ali in an unapproved rematch seven months later, which he lost by a 15-round unanimous decision. Besides being heavyweight champion and his characteristic gap-toothed grin (due to losing two and later all four of his front teeth), Spinks gained notoriety for the disaster which befell his career following the loss to Ali.Riches to rags The Boston Globe, December 21, 2005
Leon was introduced to the sport by Melvin Westbrook Jr. a boxer himself at the time. Prior to turning professional, Spinks won a bronze medal at the inaugural 1974 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Havana. Two years later, he capped off his amateur career by winning a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, alongside his brother Michael Spinks, who won the gold at middleweight.  Leon defeated Cuban great Sixto Soria in an entertaining slugfest where Spinks was rocked several times by the much more polished fighter but landed a crushing overhand right that put Soria face down on the canvas.  His Olympic teammates included Sugar Ray Leonard, Leo Randolph and Howard Davis Jr. Leon also served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps.[tpl]When|date=February 2013[/tpl]

Save the Tiger is a 1973 film about moral conflict in contemporary America. It stars Jack Lemmon, Jack Gilford, Laurie Heineman, Thayer David, Lara Parker and Liv Lindeland.  The film was directed by John G. Avildsen. The screenplay was adapted by Steve Shagan from his novel of the same title (the first book by the author of The Formula and other thrillers, and generally regarded to be his most successful novel by literary standards).
Lemmon won the 1973 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Harry Stoner (making him the first of six actors to win Oscars for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor), an executive at a Los Angeles apparel company on the edge of ruin. Throughout the film, Stoner struggles with the complexity of modern life versus the simplicity of his youth. He longs for the days when pitchers wound up, jazz filled the air, and the flag was more than a pattern to put on a pants pocket.  He wrestles with the guilt of surviving the war and yet losing touch with the ideals for which his friends died. To Harry Stoner, the world has given up on integrity, and threatens to destroy anyone who clings to it. He is caught between watching everything he has worked for evaporate, or becoming another grain of sand in the erosion of the values he once held so dear.

The state of Ohio is the home of a number of public and private institutions of higher learning. Several of these institutions are ranked among the top national universities (in order), including Case Western Reserve University (private), The Ohio State University (public), Miami University (public), University of Dayton (private), Ohio University (public), University of Cincinnati (public), Bowling Green State University (public), and Kent State University (public). Ohio State is the largest university in the United States as of 2006, 2007, and 2008; it was designated as the "Land Grant and National Research" institution of the newly established University System of Ohio. Case Western Reserve and Ohio State are Ohio's two members of the Association of American Universities as well as the universities with the largest endowments. Ohio University is the oldest university in the Northwest Territory and Xavier University is the oldest Catholic Institution in the Northwest Territory. Miami University in 1986 and Ohio State in 2001 were noted as "public ivy" institutions, the state/public equivalent of a private Ivy League institutions. Ohio University's journalism school ranks, with Columbia University's journalism school, as one of the nation's best. University of Akron's Polymer Science and engineering program is among top five in the US, as ranked by U.S. News & World Report.
According to the most recent undergraduate rankings by US News & World Report, Case Western Reserve is Ohio's highest ranked university at 38. Ohio State is Ohio's highest ranked public national university at 55, and Oberlin College is Ohio's highest ranked liberal arts college at 23.
The Ohio Board of Regents oversees the public institutions of higher education in Ohio. This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful "utility" organizations, such as OhioLINK and the Ohio Supercomputer Center, which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.
Eleven of the 13 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics, with Ohio State ranking as one of the nation's top five universities by enrollment. The remaining two public institutions -- Shawnee State University and Central State University—are relatively small. The University of Dayton is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by Case Western Reserve, Ashland University, Franklin University, and Xavier University.

Give 'em Hell, Harry! is a biographical play and 1975 film, written by playwright Samuel Gallu. Both the play and film are a one-man show about former President of the United States Harry S. Truman. Give 'em Hell, Harry! stars James Whitmore and was directed by Steve Binder and Peter H. Hunt.
The title comes from an incident that took place during the 1948 Presidential election campaign. In Harrisburg, Illinois, Truman delivered a speech attacking the Republicans. During the speech a supporter yelled out "Give 'em Hell, Harry!".  Truman replied, "I don't give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it's Hell." Subsequently, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!" became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters. 
The play previewed in Hershey, Pennsylvania, followed by its official opening at Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC. Its April 17, 1975, premiere was hosted by Truman's daughter Margaret and attended by President Gerald Ford. The play then went on to a six-city tour, during which it was videotaped for film on the stage of the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington, using a live editing process called Theatrovision.[tpl]cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Review: Give 'em Hell, Harry! |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010324/1023 |date=January 1, 1975[/tpl] James Whitmore was nominated for Best Actor by both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes.

Equus is a play by Peter Shaffer written in 1973, telling the story of a psychiatrist who attempts to treat a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses.
Shaffer was inspired to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses in a small town near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account of what might have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist, Dr. Martin Dysart, to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose. The stage show ran in London between 1973 and 1975: later came the Broadway productions that starred Anthony Hopkins as Dysart (later played by Richard Burton, Leonard Nimoy, and Anthony Perkins), and from the London production, Peter Firth as Alan.  Tom Hulce replaced Firth during the Broadway run. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances.  Marian Seldes appeared in every single performance of the Broadway run, first in the role of Hesther and then as Dora.  
Numerous other issues inform the narrative. Most important are religious and ritual sacrifice themes, and the manner in which character Alan Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme godhead, "Equus". Alan sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his "God" with sexual attraction. Also important is Shaffer's examination of the conflict between personal values and satisfaction and societal mores, expectations and institutions. In reference to the play's classical structure, themes and characterisation, Shaffer has discussed the conflict between Apollonian and Dionysian values and systems in human life.

Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:
Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "crackers"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term "hacker", and whose primary focus — be it to malign or benevolent purposes — lies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.

After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century.
From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records.
Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, André Previn, Lorin Maazel and Seiji Ozawa. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

A Corps area was a geographically-based organizational structure (area command) of the United States Army used to accomplish administrative, training and tactical tasks from 1920 to 1942. Each corps area included divisions of the Regular Army, Organized Reserve and National Guard of the United States. Developed as a result of serious mobilization problems during World War I, this organizational scheme provided a framework to rapidly expand the Army in time of war or national emergency such as the Great Depression.
The nine corps areas, created by the War Plans Division under authority of War Department General Order No. 50 on 20 August 1920, had identical responsibilities for providing peacetime administrative and logistical support to the army’s mobile units as was provided by the six territorial "Departments" they replaced. In addition, the corps areas took on the responsibilities for post and installation support units ("Zone of the Interior" units) created during World War I. Corps areas had the added responsibility for planning and implementing mobilization plans for all Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve mobile units in their respective geographic areas; the development and administration of hundreds of new Organized Reserve and Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) units; and managing the personnel records for thousands of Reserve officers, enlisted personnel, ROTC cadets, and Citizens Military Training Camp (CMTC) candidates.
The composition of the corps areas divided the United States geographically by state lines and population density into nine multi-state area commands roughly equal in population. Each corps area was responsible for organizing two tactical corps consisting of three infantry divisions each. Each corps area also had responsibility for organizing various other field army, General Headquarters Reserve, Zone of the Interior (later designated as Corps Area Service Command), and Communications Zone units. The First, Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Corps Areas also organized units to man various fixed coastal defenses. The corps areas were further grouped into three army areas of two field armies each.

[[Modern art]]
CATEGORIES: Modern art

Modern art includes artistic works produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era.Atkins 1990, p. 102. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.Gombrich 1958, p. 419.  Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called Contemporary art or Postmodern art.
Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Matisse's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.Russell T. Clement. Four French Symbolists. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114. It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.
Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and other late 19th century innovators Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions. Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, exemplified by Violin and Candlestick, Paris, from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by Synthetic cubism, practised by Braque, Picasso, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s. Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The notion of modern art is closely related to Modernism."One way of understanding the relation of the terms 'modern,' 'modernity,' and 'modernism' is that aesthetic modernism is a form of art characteristic of high or actualized late modernity, that is, of that period in which social, economic, and cultural life in the widest sense was revolutionized by modernity ... means that modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Social modernity is the home of modernist art, even where that art rebels against it." Cahoone 1996, p. 13.

Henry Walter Bates FRS FLS, FGS (Leicester. Born 8 February 1825 – London, 16 February 1892) was an English naturalist and explorer who gave the first scientific account of mimicry in animals. He was most famous for his expedition to the rainforests of the Amazon with Alfred Russel Wallace, starting in 1848. Wallace returned in 1852, but lost his collection on the return voyage when his ship caught fire. When Bates arrived home in 1859 after a full eleven years, he had sent back over 14,712 species (mostly of insects) of which 8,000 were new to science.Clodd, in Bates H.W. 1892.

[[Court of Chancery]]

CATEGORIES: 1340s establishments in England, 1875 disestablishments, Courts of equity, English civil law, Former courts and tribunals in England and Wales, 14th century in law, 14th century in London

The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness (or "inequity") of the common law. The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity, including trusts, land law, the administration of the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants. Its initial role was somewhat different, however; as an extension of the Lord Chancellor's role as Keeper of the King's Conscience, the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law. Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts, whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence, and was far more flexible. Until the 19th century, the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than the common law courts, such as specific performance and injunctions, and also had some power to grant damages in special circumstances. With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841, the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system.
Academics estimate that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff, the Chancery. Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticized for its slow pace, large backlogs, and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the Chancery Division – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body.
For much of its existence the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included a large number of clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, one of the main reasons why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.

Sir Georg Solti, KBE ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɔr|dʒ|_|ˈ|ʃ|ɒ|l|t|i[/tpl]; 21 October 1912[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]5 September 1997) was an orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leo Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis, and because he was a Jew he fled the increasingly restrictive anti-semitic laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist.
After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Frankfurt Opera, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title "the Royal Opera". He became a British subject in 1972.
In 1969 Solti was appointed music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He restored the orchestra's reputation after it had been in decline for most of the previous decade. He became the orchestra's music director laureate on his retirement in 1991. During his time with the Chicago orchestra, he also had shorter spells in charge of the Orchestre de Paris and the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making, Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a conductor in later years. He recorded many works two or three times at various stages of his career, and was a prolific recording artist, making more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. The most famous of his recordings is probably Decca's complete set of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, made between 1958 and 1965.  Solti's Ring has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, in polls for Gramophone magazine in 1999 and the BBC's Music Magazine in 2012.  Solti was repeatedly honoured by the recording industry with awards throughout his career.

Cicero on the other hand considered Servius Sulpicius Rufus as his superior in matters pertaining to the law.Rawson, E.:"Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.14. In 63 BC he was a candidate for the consulship, but was defeated by Lucius Licinius Murena, whom he subsequently accused of bribery. In 52 BC he successfully stood election to be consul in 51 BC. In the Civil War, after considerable hesitation, he threw in his lot with Caesar.  It was reported that Rufus dined with Caesar, Sallust, Hirtius, Balbus and Oppius on the night after his famous crossing over the Rubicon river into Italy January 10.[tpl]cite book|last=Dando-Collins|first=Stephan|title=The Epic Saga of Julius Caesars Tenth Legion and Rome|year=2002|isbn=0-471-09570-2|page=67[/tpl]  Caesar made him proconsul of Achaea in 46 BC. He died in 43 BC while on a mission from the senate to Marcus Antonius at Mutina. He was accorded a public funeral, and a statue was erected to his memory in front of the Rostra.
Two excellent specimens of Sulpicius's style are preserved in Cicero's letters. Ad. Fam. iv. 5 and 12. One of these is a letter of condolence to Cicero after the death of his daughter, Tullia. It is a letter that posterity has much admired, full of subtle, melancholy reflection on the transiency of all things. Byron has quoted this letter in his Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1964) p.250-251.  Quintilian Instit. x. 1, 1,6. speaks of three orations by Sulpicius as still in existence; one of these was the speech against Murena, another Pro or Contra Aufidium, of whom nothing is known. He is also said to have been a writer of erotic poems.
It is as a jurist, however, that Sulpicius was chiefly distinguished. He left behind him a large number of treatises, and he is often quoted in the Pandects, although direct extracts are not found.For titles see Teuffel-Schwabe, Hist. of Roman Lit. 174, 4). His chief characteristics were lucidity, an intimate acquaintance with the principles of civil and natural law, and an unrivaled power of expression.

Thomas Linacre (or Lynaker) (c. 1460 – 20 October 1524) was a humanist scholar and physician, after whom Linacre College, Oxford and Linacre House The King's School, Canterbury are named.[tpl]cite ODNB |last=Nutton|first=Vivian|title=Linacre, Thomas (c.1460–1524)|id=16667 |year=2004[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Linacre (boys, boarding, 1953)|url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31677&id=1:31668&id=1:31637|work=The King's School, Canterbury|accessdate=9 June 2011[/tpl]
Linacre was more of a scholar than a scientific investigator. It is difficult to judge his practical skill in his profession, but it was highly esteemed in his own day. He took no part in political or theological questions, but his career as a scholar was characteristic of the critical period in the history of learning through which he lived.
He was one of the first Englishmen to study Greek in Italy, and brought back to his native country and his own university the lessons of the "New Learning".[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] His teachers were some of the greatest scholars of the day. Among his pupils was one—Erasmus—whose name alone would suffice to preserve the memory of his instructor in Greek, and others of note in letters and politics, such as Sir Thomas More, Prince Arthur and Queen Mary I of England.

William Grocyn ([tpl]circa[/tpl] 1446 – 1519) was an English scholar, a friend of Erasmus.
He was born at Colerne, Wiltshire. Intended by his parents for the church, he was sent to Winchester College, and in 1465 was elected to a scholarship at New College, Oxford. In 1467 he became a fellow, and among his pupils was William Warham, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1479, Grocyn accepted the rectory of Newton Longville, in Buckinghamshire, but continued to live at Oxford. As reader in divinity at Magdalen College in 1481, he held a disputation with John Taylor, professor of divinity, in the presence of King Richard III; the king acknowledged his skill as a debater by the present of a deer and five marks. In 1485, Grocyn became prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral. In about 1488, he left England for Italy, and before his return in 1491 he had visited Florence, Rome and Padua, and studied Greek and Latin under Demetrius Chalcondyles and Politian. As lecturer at Exeter College, Oxford he helped indoctrinate his countrymen in the new Greek learning.
Erasmus says in one of his letters that Grocyn taught Greek at Oxford before his visit to Italy. The Warden of New College, Thomas Chaundler, invited Cornelius Vitelli, then on a visit to Oxford, to act as praelector. This was about 1475, and as Vitelli was certainly familiar with Greek literature, Grocyn may have learned Greek from him. He seems to have lived in Oxford until 1499, but by the time his friend John Colet became dean of St Paul's in 1504 he was living in London. He was chosen by Colet to deliver lectures in St Paul's. Having at first denounced those who impugned the authenticity of the Hierarchia ecclesiastica ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, he was led to modify his views by further investigation, and openly declared that he had been mistaken. He also counted Thomas Linacre, William Lilye, William Latimer and Thomas More among his friends, and Erasmus writing in 1514 says that he was supported by Grocyn in London, and calls him "the friend and preceptor of us all".
He held several preferments, but his generosity to his friends involved him in continual difficulties, and though in 1506 he was appointed on Archbishop Warham's recommendation master or warden of College of All Saints, Maidstone in Kent, he was still obliged to borrow from his friends, and even to pledge his plate as a security. He died in 1519, and was buried in the collegiate church at Maidstone.
Linacre acted as his executor, and spent the money he received on alms for the poor and the purchase of books for poor scholars. With the exception of a few lines of Latin verse on a lady who snowballed him, and a letter to Aldus Manutius at the head of Linacre's translation of Proclus's Sphaera (Venice, 1499), Grocyn left no literary proof of his scholarship. His proposal to translate Aristotle in company with Linacre and Latimer was never carried out. Anthony Wood assigns some Latin works to Grocyn, but on insufficient authority. By Erasmus he has been described as "vir severissimae castissimae vitae, ecclesiasticarum constitutionum observantissimus pene usque ad superstitionem, scholasticae theologiae ad unguem doctus ac natura etiam acerrimi judicii, demum in omni disciplinarum genere exacte versatus", "A man of a most stern and moral life; most observant of the decrees of the Church almost to the point of superstition; learned to his very fingertips in scholastic theology; and also by nature of the keenest judgment; finally, exactly versed in every kind of learning" (Declarationes ad censures facultatis theoiogiae Parisianae, 1522).
An account of Grocyn by M. Burrows appeared in the Oxford Historical Society's Collectanea (1890).
Grocyn gives his name to the University of Oxford's chief lecturer on Classical languages. The current Grocyn Lecturer is Juliane Kerkhecker, a fellow and tutor of Oriel College.

Wasteland is a science fiction role-playing video game developed by Interplay Productions and first published by Electronic Arts for the Commodore 64, Apple II and PC DOS in 1988. The game is set in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic America that was destroyed by nuclear holocaust generations before. It was re-released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in 2013 by inXile Entertainment.
Critically acclaimed and commercially successful, Wasteland was intended to be followed by two separate sequels, but Electronic Arts' Fountain of Dreams was turned into an unrelated game and Interplay's own Meantime was cancelled. The game's general setting and concept, however, became the basis for Interplay's 1997 role-playing video game Fallout, which itself would extend into a successful series. An official follow-up titled Wasteland 2 is currently in works by inXile Entertainment and Obsidian Entertainment.

In agriculture, a harrow (often called a set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by ploughing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Such coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds). 
There are four general types of harrows: disc harrow, tine harrow, chain harrow and chain disk harrows.  Harrows were originally drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.

[[Étienne Jodelle]]

CATEGORIES: 1532 births, 1573 deaths, Writers from Paris, French dramatists and playwrights

Étienne Jodelle, seigneur de Limodin (1532 – July 1573), French dramatist and poet, was born in Paris of a noble family.
He attached himself to the poetic circle of the Pléiade and proceeded to apply the principles of the reformers to dramatic composition. Jodelle aimed at creating a classical drama that should be in every respect different from the moralities and soties that then occupied the French stage, his first play, Cléopatre captive, was represented before the court at Reims in 1552. Jodelle himself took the title role, and the cast included his friends Remy Belleau and Jean de la Peruse, in honour of the play's success the friends organized a little etc. at Arcueil when a goat garlanded with flowers was led in procession and presented to the author—a ceremony exaggerated by the enemies of the Ronsardists into a renewal of the pagan rites of the worship of Bacchus.
Jodelle wrote two other plays. Eugène, a comedy satirizing the superior clergy, had less success than it deserved. Its preface poured scorn on Jodelle's predecessors in comedy, but in reality his own methods are not so very different from theirs. Didon se sacrifiant, a tragedy which follows Virgil's narrative, appears never to have been represented. Jodelle died in poverty in July 1573. His works were collected the year after his death by Charles de la Mothe. They include a quantity of miscellaneous verse dating chiefly from Jodelle's youth. The intrinsic value of his tragedies is small. Cléopatre is lyric rather than dramatic. Throughout the five acts of the piece nothing actually happens. The death of Antony is announced by his ghost in the first act; the story of Cleopatra's suicide is related, but not represented, in the fifth. Each act is terminated by a chorus which moralizes on such subjects as the inconstancy of fortune and the judgments of heaven on human pride. But the play was the starting-point of French classical tragedy, and was soon followed by the Médée (1553) of Jean de la Peruse and the Aman (1561) of André de Rivaudeau. Jodelle was a rapid worker, but idle and fond of dissipation. His friend Ronsard said that his published poems gave no adequate idea of his powers.
Jodelle's works are collected (1868) in the Pléiade française of Charles Marty-Laveaux. The prefatory notice gives full information of the sources of Jodelle's biography, and La Mothe's criticism is reprinted in its entirety.

The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World (2001) is a book by Lawrence Lessig, at the time of writing a professor of law at Stanford Law School, who is well known as a critic of the extension of the copyright term in US.[tpl]cite web|last=Starr|first=Sandy|title=Culture warrior|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2369/|publisher=Spiked|accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=July 2, 2004[/tpl] It is a continuation of his previous book Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, which is about how computer programs can restrict freedom of ideas in cyberspace.
While copyright helps artists get rewarded for their work, Lessig warns that a copyright regime that is too strict and grants copyright for too long a period of time (e.g. the current US legal climate) can destroy innovation, as the future always builds on the past.[tpl]cite web|last=Gelernter|first=David|title=The Computer World, Inside and Out|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/12/books/books-of-the-times-the-computer-world-inside-and-out.html?pagewanted=all|work=Books of the Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=December 12, 2001[/tpl]  Lessig also discusses recent movements by corporate interests to promote longer and tighter protection of intellectual property in three layers: the code layer, the content layer, and the physical layer.
The code layer is that which is controlled by computer programs. One instance is Internet censorship in mainland China by sorting out geographical IP addresses. The content layer is notoriously illustrated by Napster, a peer-to-peer file sharing service.  Lessig criticizes the reaction of music companies and Hollywood.[tpl]cite news|last=Stalder|first=Felix|title=The excess of control|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/11/11504/1.html|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=Telepolis|date=January 8, 2002[/tpl] The physical layer is the one that actually conveys information from one point to another, and can be either wired or wireless. He discusses particularly the regulation of the radio spectrum in the United States.
In the end, he stresses the importance of existing works entering the public domain in a reasonably short period of time, as the Founding Fathers intended.
On 15 January 2008, Lessig announced on his blog that his publishers agreed to license the book under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license, and the book in PDF format can be downloaded freely.Lessig, Lawrence. The Future of Ideas is now Free. Last accessed on January 16, 2008.

[[Colliers Wood]]

CATEGORIES: Areas of London, Districts of Merton

Colliers Wood is an area in south west London, England, in the London Borough of Merton. It is a mostly residential area, split down the middle by a busy high street. There are two large shopping areas; The Tandem Centre and the Priory Retail Park, as well as a large supermarket complex built in 1989 on the site of an old print works. 
Colliers Wood Station is served by the London Underground's Northern Line.
Colliers Wood is home to three parks: a recreation ground, the National Trust-owned Wandle Park, which covers an area of approximately [tpl]convert|11|acre|m2[/tpl], and the more informal Wandle Meadow Nature Park. There is a footbridge over the river to access the latter from Bewley Street, which has been uncrossable since it was installed in 2007, due to there being no funding available to build an access ramp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collierswoodresidentsassociation.org.uk/bridge/|title=The Bridge To Nowhere[/tpl] It is intended to be part of the Wandle Trail, which passes through the suburb.
Colliers Wood United F.C. is a semi-professional football club founded in Colliers Wood but now based elsewhere.
Colliers Wood shares its postcode district with Wimbledon, with postcode lookups returning this suburb name and some organisations insisting on its use. It merges into Merton Abbey.
In 2006, local resident and ex-resident of Slough Keith Spears,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wimbledonnews/9018064.Volunteers_reveal_surprising_inspirations_at_awards_night/ |title=Outstanding volunteers reveal surprising inspirations at Merton Council Civic Awards night |publisher=Yourlocalguardian.co.uk |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] having seen the BBC TV series Making Slough Happy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4436482.stm |title=Making Slough Happy |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] started the "Making Colliers Wood Happy!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://makingcollierswoodhappy.org.uk/ |title=Making Colliers Wood Happy! |publisher=Making Colliers Wood Happy! |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02[/tpl] initiative as a way of building community spirit to counteract the decline in neighbourliness in suburban areas.

[[William Lilly]]

William Lilly ([tpl]OldStyleDate|11 May|1602|1 May[/tpl][tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]9 June 1681) has been described as "the most abused as well as the most celebrated astrologer of the seventeenth century".[tpl]sfn|Capp|1979|p=57[/tpl]  Born the son of a yeoman farmer in Leicestershire, Lilly travelled to London as a youth to take up a servant's position. Seven years later he secured his fortune by marrying his former master's widow, allowing him the leisure to study astrology. In 1644, during the  English Civil War, he published the first of many popular astrological texts,[tpl]sfn|Bayle|1738|p=82[/tpl] and in 1647 he published Christian Astrology, a huge compendium of astrological technique. This was the first of its kind to be printed in the English language rather than Latin, and is said to have tutored "a nation in crisis in the language of the stars".[tpl]sfn|Kassell|2007|p=72[/tpl]  By 1659, Lilly's fame was widely acknowledged and his annual almanac was achieving sales of around 30,000 copies a year.[tpl]sfn|Capp|1979|p=44[/tpl]
Lilly's autobiography, published towards the end of his life in 1681, at the request of his patron Elias Ashmole, gives candid accounts of the political events of his era, and biographical details of contemporaries that are unavailable elsewhere.[tpl]sfn|Geneva|1995|p=55[/tpl] It was described, in the late 18th century, as "one of the most entertaining narratives in our language", in particular for the historical portrayal it leaves of men like John Dee, Simon Forman, John Booker, Edward Kelley, and for its curious tales about the effects of crystals and the appearance of Queen Mab.[tpl]sfn|Lilly|1681|p=iii-v[/tpl] In it, Lilly describes the friendly support of Oliver Cromwell during a period in which he faced prosecution for issuing political astrological predictions.[tpl]sfn|Lilly|1681|p=163[/tpl] He also writes about the 1666 Great Fire of London, and how he was brought before the committee investigating the cause of the fire, being suspected of involvement because of his publication of images, 15 years earlier, which depicted a city in flames surrounded by coffins.[tpl]sfn|Lilly|1681|p=215[/tpl]
Lilly was a controversial character who was both aided and abetted by powerful friends and enemies. He attracted the attention of many members of Parliament, through the support of Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England, (to whom he dedicated his Christian Astrology),[tpl]sfn|Houlding|1010|p=1|ps=, see footnote 1.[/tpl] but also accuses Members of Parliament of engineering charges against him in in 1651.[tpl]sfn|Lilly|1681|p=158[/tpl] To his supporters he was an "English Merlin"; to his detractors he was a "juggling wizard and imposter".[tpl]sfn|Dunn|2012|p=119[/tpl] He is described as having been a genius at something "that modern mainstream opinion has since decided cannot be done at all", and having developed his stature as the most important astrologer in England through his social and political involvement, as well as his impact on the astrological tradition.[tpl]sfn|Lewis|2003|p=414-5[/tpl]

Percy is a British comedy film directed by Ralph Thomas starring Hywel Bennett, Denholm Elliott, Elke Sommer and Britt Ekland. 
Edwin (Bennett), an innocent and shy young man, is hit by a nude man falling from a high-rise building while carrying a chandelier. Edwin's penis is mutilated in the accident and has to be amputated; the falling man is killed. 
Edwin becomes the recipient of the world's first penis transplant: he receives the very large penis of the womanizer killed in the same accident. With his new bit of anatomy (which he names "Percy"), Edwin follows the womanizer's footsteps, meeting all his women friends, before settling happily with the donor's mistreated widow.
The film is based on a novel of the same name by Raymond Hitchcock (father of musician Robyn Hitchcock), and is today remembered for its soundtrack by The Kinks. It was followed by a 1974 sequel, Percy's Progress.

Manuel (or Emmanuel) Chrysoloras ([tpl]lang-el|Μανουὴλ Χρυσολωρᾶς[/tpl]; c. 1355 – 15 April 1415) was a pioneer in the introduction of Greek literature to Western Europe during the late middle ages.
He was born in Constantinople to a distinguished family.  In 1390, he led an embassy sent to Venice by the emperor Manuel II Palaeologus to implore the aid of the Christian princes against the Muslim Turks. Roberto de' Rossi of Florence met him in Venice, and, in 1395, Rossi's acquaintance Giacomo da Scarperia set off for Constantinople to study Greek with Chrysoloras. In 1396, Coluccio Salutati, the chancellor of the University of Florence, invited him to come and teach Greek grammar and literature, quoting Cicero:
Chrysoloras arrived in the winter of 1397, an event remembered by one his most famous pupils, the humanist scholar Leonardo Bruni, as a great new opportunity: there were many teachers of law, but no one had studied Greek in Italy for 700 years. Another very famous pupil of Chrysoloras was Ambrogio Traversari, who became general of the Camaldolese order. Chrysoloras remained only a few years in Florence, from 1397 to 1400, teaching Greek, starting with the rudiments. He moved on to teach in Bologna and later in Venice and Rome. Though he taught widely, a handful of his chosen students remained a close-knit group, among the first humanists of the Renaissance. Among his pupils were numbered some of the foremost figures of the revival of Greek studies in Renaissance Italy. Aside from Bruni and Ambrogio Traversari, they included Guarino da Verona and Pallas Strozzi.
Having visited Milan and Pavia, and having resided for several years at Venice, he went to Rome on the invitation of Bruni, who was then secretary to Pope Gregory XII. In 1408, he was sent to Paris on an important mission from the emperor Manuel Palaeologus. In 1413, he went to Germany on an embassy to the emperor Sigismund, the object of which was to fix a place for the church council that later assembled at Constance. Chrysoloras was on his way there, having been chosen to represent the Greek Church, when he died suddenly. His death gave rise to commemorative essays of which Guarino da Verona made a collection in Chrysolorina.
Chrysoloras translated the works of Homer and Plato's Republic into Latin. His own works, which circulated in manuscript in his lifetime, include brief works on the Procession of the Holy Ghost, and letters to his brothers, to L. Bruni, Guauni, Traversari, and to Pallas Strozzi, as well as two which were eventually printed, his Erotemata Civas Questiones which was the first basic Greek grammar in use in Western Europe, first published in 1484 and widely reprinted, and which enjoyed considerable success not only among his pupils in Florence, but also among later leading humanists, being immediately studied by Thomas Linacre at Oxford and by Desiderius Erasmus at Cambridge; and Epistolæ tres de comparatione veteris et novæ Romæ (Three Letters on the Comparison of Old and New Rome, i.e. a comparison of Rome and Constantinople). Many of his treatises on morals and ethics and other philosophical subjects came into print in the 17th and 18th centuries, because of their antiquarian interest. He was chiefly influential through his teaching in familiarizing men such as Leonardo Bruni, Coluccio Salutati, Giacomo da Scarperia, Roberto de' Rossi, Carlo Marsuppini, Pietro Candido Decembrio, Guarino da Verona, Poggio Bracciolini, with the masterpieces of Greek literature.

It was a unit that used proprietary floppy disks (called "Disk Cards") for data storage.http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/ It was announced, but not released, for the North American/PAL Nintendo Entertainment System. Through its entire production span, 1986–2003, 4.44 million units were sold.
The device was connected to the Famicom deck by plugging a modified cartridge known as the RAM Adapter into the system's cartridge port, which attached via a supplied cable to the disk drive. The RAM adapter contained 32 kilobytes (KB) of RAM for temporary program storage, 8 KB of RAM for tile and sprite data storage, and an ASIC known as the 2C33. The ASIC acted as a disk controller for the floppy drive, and also included additional sound hardware featuring a primitive wavetable synthesizer. The Disk Cards used were double-sided, with a total capacity of 112 KB per disk. Many games spanned both sides of a disk, requiring the user to switch sides at some point during gameplay. A few games used two full disks (four sides). The Disk System was capable of running on six C-cell batteries or the supplied AC adapter. Batteries would usually last five months with daily game play. The battery option was included due to the likelihood of a standard set of AC plugs already being occupied by a Famicom and a television.

An oil platform, (offshore platform or colloquially oil rig) is a large structure with facilities to drill wells, to extract and process oil and natural gas, and to temporarily store product until it can be brought to shore for refining and marketing. In many cases, the platform contains facilities to house the workforce as well.
Depending on the circumstances, the platform may be fixed to the ocean floor, may consist of an artificial island, or may float. Remote subsea wells may also be connected to a platform by flow lines and by umbilical connections. These subsea solutions may consist of one or more subsea wells, or of one or more manifold centres for multiple wells.

[[Irish farm subdivision]]
CATEGORIES: Land reform in Ireland

The Popery Act (Penal Law) of 1704 required land held (typically in tenancy) by Roman Catholics to be divided equally between all a landholder's sons, both legitimate and illegitimate, on his death.  This had formerly been normal under the law of gavelkind, a law abolished by the Dublin administration in 1604. It has been argued that under the this custom had existed to pre-Norman times and covered not merely land inheritance, but even inheritance of kingship, where Irish monarchs and chieftains were not succeeded by their eldest son but by one family member elected by and from five generations of family members.  The Penal Laws merely complicated issues such as tenancy, inheritance and the enforcement of the millennia-old tradition of equality among children. Such laws and customs were enforced in different ways, rigidly or otherwise, against different classes and religions, prior to the period in question. Known as 
sub-division, this inheritance practice continued by tradition until the middle of the 19th century.
The growth of population inevitably caused subdivision. Population grew from a level of about 500,000 in 1000 AD to about 2 million by 1700, and 5 million by 1800. On the eve of the Great Famine the population of Ireland had risen to 8 million, most people living on ever-smaller farms and depending on the potato as a staple diet.
By the 1840s, many farms had become so small that the only food source that could be grown in sufficient quantity to feed a family was potatoes. This was to have disastrous effects when, in the period 1847-50 a series of potato blight struck, making much of the potatoes grown inedible. This period came to be known as the Great Famine and led to the deaths of a million people. 
Subsequently, a change in the law required that the tenancy go to only one legitimate son.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] With the wholescale deaths and massive emigration of the period, farm sizes had begun to increase, as surviving holdings were merged with neighbouring vacated ones. The prohibition of sub-division ensured that in normal circumstances they would not decrease in size any further. 
A secondary effect of the prohibition of sub-division was that other children, who would previously have inherited part of the family farm tenancy or married into a similar small farm, were forced to seek employment elsewhere. Many emigrated. Many entered religious life, as Roman Catholic priests, nuns or monks, such options becoming available due to a re-organisation of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland under Cardinal Cullen from the 1850s. This influx of young people into the religious life, thanks to the disappearance of sub-division, in part explains the massive growth in clerical numbers in Ireland in the period. 
Irish landholdings underwent further massive change in the period between the 1880s and the 1930s when a seriesLand Acts of Land Acts by the Irish Land Commission and Congested Districts Board for Ireland broke up the previous large estates from which tenant farmers rented property and who were empowered by British and (later) Irish government grants and loans to buy their farms instead of renting them.

[[Katipunan]]
CATEGORIES: Philippine Revolution, Philippine–American War, Secret societies, Defunct organizations of the Philippines

The Katipunan (KKK) was a Philippine revolutionary society founded by anti-Spanish Filipinos in Manila in 1892, whose primary aim was to gain independence from Spain through revolution. The society was initiated by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa, and others on the night of July 7, when Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan. Initially, the Katipunan was a secret organization until its discovery in 1896 that led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The word "katipunan," literally means 'association,' comes from the root word "tipon," a Tagalog word meaning "gather together" or "society."[tpl]harvnb|Woods|2006|p=43[/tpl] Its official revolutionary name was Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan[tpl]Harvnb|Cruz|November 16, 1922[/tpl] Chapter 2, Question 12.  [tpl]lang-tl|"Kailan at saan itinayo ang "Samahang Kataas-taasang, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan?"[/tpl]  [tpl]Lang-en|"When and where was the Supreme and Most Honorable Society of the Children of the Nation established?"[/tpl]"May be transliterated to modern Tagalog orthography as Kataastaasang, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan. ([tpl]lang-en|Supreme and Most Honorable Society of the Children of the Nation[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Suprema y Venerable Asociación de los Hijos del Pueblo[/tpl]). The Katipunan is also known by its acronym, 'KKK'''. The organization has no affiliation with the racist group known as the Ku Klux Klan who are also associated with the acronym "KKK".
Being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide with the rules established by the society. Aspirant applicants were given standard initiation rites to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted in the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Liberty) that had its first and last print on March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Philippine literature were expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise of rescuing Rizal from his detainment. On May 1896, a delegation was sent to the Emperor of Japan to solicit funds and military arms. The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities after a member named Teodoro Patiño confessed the Katipunan's illegal activities to his sister, and finally to the mother portress of Mandaluyong Orphanage. Seven days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, on August 26, 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore their cédulas during the infamous Cry of Pugadlawin that started the Philippine Revolution.

In the autumn 937, Olaf led his allies into battle against Æthelstan in the Battle of Brunanburh and was decisively defeated.
After Athelstan's death in 939, Olaf again invaded York the same year, forcing Athelstan's successor, Edmund, into a treaty which ceded to Olaf Northumbria and part of Mercia. Uniquely, the legend of his silver penny minted at York is not in Latin or Old English but in Old Norse; the bird emblem perhaps represents the raven associated with the battle-god Odin.Noted in Richard Hall, Viking Age Archaeology 1995:25 and fig. 9.

[[Calque]]

CATEGORIES: Etymology, Calques, Linguistic purism

In linguistics, a calque ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|k[/tpl]) or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word ([tpl]lang-la|verbum pro verbo[/tpl]) or root-for-root translation.
Used as a verb, "to calque" means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components so as to create a new lexeme in the target language.
"Calque" is a loanword from a French noun, and derives from the verb "calquer" ("to trace", "to copy").Calque, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000 "Loanword" is a calque of the German "Lehnwort", just as "loan translation" is of "Lehnübersetzung".Robb: German English Words germanenglishwords.com
Proving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword, since in some cases a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the language proposed to be borrowing, or the calque contains less obvious imagery.
Calquing is distinct from phono-semantic matching.[tpl]cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |url= http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=140391723X |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4039-1723-X [/tpl] While calquing includes semantic translation, it does not consist of phonetic matching (i.e. retaining the approximate sound of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existent word or morpheme in the target language).

Amlaíb mac Sitric (c. 927[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]981; Old Norse: Óláfr Sigtryggsson), commonly called Amlaíb Cuarán, in Old Norse: Óláfr kváran, was a 10th-century Norse-Gael who was King of Northumbria and Dublin. His byname, cuarán, is usually translated as "sandal". His name appears in a variety of anglicized forms, including Olaf Cuaran and Olaf Sihtricson, particularly in relation to his short-lived rule in York.In Old English he was Anlaf. To Irish speakers he may also have been Amlaíb mac ua Ímair or Amlaíb ua Ímair but others shared these names. Likewise, his Norse nickname, "Olaf the Red" was applied to several Norse rulers in Ireland and the Isles. He was the last of the Uí Ímair to play a major part in the politics of the British Isles.
Amlaíb was twice, perhaps three times, ruler of Northumbria and twice ruler of Dublin and its dependencies. His reign over these territories spanned some forty years. He was a renowned warrior and a ruthless pillager of churches, but ended his days in retirement at Iona Abbey. Born when the Uí Ímair ruled over large areas of the British Isles, by his death the kingdom of Dublin was a minor power in Irish politics. At the same time, Dublin became a major centre of trade in Atlantic Europe and mastery over the city and its wealth became the supreme prize for ambitious Irish kings.
In death Amlaíb was the prototype for the Middle English romance character Havelok the Dane. In life he was a patron of Irish poets and Scandinavian skalds who wrote verses praising their paymaster. Amlaíb was married at least twice, and had many children who married into Irish and Scandinavian royal families. His descendants were kings in the Isle of Man and the Hebrides until the 13th century.

Although not all people in Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism. It was first introduced as "the Never Never Land" in the theatre play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, first staged in 1904.
In his 1911 novelization Peter and Wendy, Barrie referred to "the Neverland", and its many variations "the Neverlands".[tpl]cite book | last = Barrie | first = James Matthew | authorlink = J. M.

In the 1928 published version of the script, it was shortened to "the Never Land". Neverland has been featured prominently in subsequent works, either adapting Barrie's works or expanding upon them. These Neverlands sometimes vary in nature from the original.

The Livonian Brothers of the Sword ([tpl]lang-la|Fratres militiæ Christi Livoniae[/tpl], [tpl]lang-de|Schwertbrüderorden[/tpl]) were a military order established by their second bishop, Bishop Albert of Riga, in 1202. Pope Innocent III sanctioned the establishment in 1204 for the second time. The membership of the order comprised  German "warrior monks".  Alternative names of the Order include the different more popular used name as Christ Knights, Sword Brethren, and The Militia of Christ of Livonia. 
Following their defeat by the Samogitians and Semigallians in the Battle of Schaulen (Saule) in 1236, the surviving Brothers merged into the Teutonic Order as an autonomous branch and became known as the Livonian Order.

The three kanji characters 公明党 have the approximate meanings of "public/government" (公 kō), "light/brightness" (明 mei), and "political party" (党 tō). The combination "kōmei" (公明) is usually taken to mean "justice or fairness". The word "New" is not a part of the Japanese name, but is used in English to distinguish the party from its predecessor. The NKP was formed as a result of a merger between the Kōmeitō and the New Peace Party on November 7, 1998.
After the 2012 general election the party held 31 seats in the lower house and 19 seats in the upper house.

CATEGORIES: Management, Project management, Software development philosophies, Software project management

  Iterative and Incremental development is any combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for development.  The combination is of long standing
 and has been widely suggested for large development efforts. For example, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167[ref]
DOD-STD-2167 Defense Systems Software Development (04 JUN 1985) on everyspec.com [/ref]
mentions (in section 4.1.2): "During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time." and "This process may be described as an 'evolutionary acquisition' or 'incremental build' approach." The relationship between iterations and increments is determined by the overall software development methodology and software development process.  The exact number and nature of the particular incremental builds and what is iterated will be specific to each individual development effort. 
thumb|300px|An iterative development model[tpl]Software development process[/tpl]
Iterative and incremental development are essential parts of the Modified waterfall models, Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming and generally the various agile software development frameworks.
It follows a similar process to the plan-do-check-act cycle of business process improvement.

The Coasters are an American rhythm and blues/rock and roll vocal group that had a string of hits in the late 1950s.  Beginning with "Searchin'" and "Young Blood," their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of Leiber and Stoller. Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream doo wop, their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo wop legacy through the 1960s.

Heavenly Creatures is a 1994 New Zealand drama film directed by Peter Jackson, from a screenplay he co-wrote with his partner, Fran Walsh, about the notorious 1954 Parker–Hulme murder case in Christchurch, New Zealand. The film features Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in their screen debuts with supporting roles by Sarah Peirse, Diana Kent, Clive Merrison, and Sarah O'Connor. The main premise deals with the obsessive relationship between two teenage girls, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, who murder Parker's mother. The events of the film cover the period from the girls' meeting in 1952 to the murder in 1954.
The film opened to strong critical acclaim at the 51st Venice International Film Festival in 1994 and became one of the best-received films of the year. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production. Particular attention was given to the performances by the previously unknown Winslet and Lynskey, and for Jackson's directing. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay but lost to Pulp Fiction.

[[Orion (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Greek giants, Mythological Greek archers, Offspring of Poseidon, Fictional hunters

Orion ([tpl]lang-grc|Ὠρίων[/tpl]Genitive case: Ὠρίωνος. or [tpl]lang|grc|Ὠαρίων[/tpl], Latin: OrionThe Latin transliteration Oarion of [tpl]lang|grc|Ὠαρίων[/tpl] is found, but is quite rare.) was a giant huntsman in Greek mythology whom Zeus  placed among the stars as the constellation of Orion.
Ancient sources tell several different stories about Orion. There are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.
In Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of his story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth. 
Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which we have the most evidence (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Straits of Sicily.

[[Anthology film]]
CATEGORIES: Anthology films, Film styles, Film genres

An anthology film (also known as an omnibus film, package film, or portmanteau film) is a feature film consisting of several different short films, often tied together by only a single theme, premise, or brief interlocking event (often a turning point). Sometimes each one is directed by a different director. These differ from "revue films" such as Paramount on Parade (1930)—which were common in Hollywood in the early sound film era to show off their stars and related vaudeville-style acts—composite films, and compilation films.
Sometimes there is a theme, such as a place (e.g. New York Stories, Paris, je t'aime), a person (e.g. Four Rooms), or a thing (e.g. Twenty Bucks, Coffee and Cigarettes), that is present in each story and serves to bind them together. Two of the earliest films to use the form were Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel (1932), released by MGM with an all-star cast; and Paramount's If I Had a Million (also 1932), featuring segments helmed by a number of directors.
European directors such as Roberto Rossellini directed anthology films such as L'Amore (segments: "Il Miracolo" and "Una voce umana") (1948), Les Sept péchés capitaux (segment: "Envie, L'Envy") (1952), Siamo donne (segment: "Ingrid Bergman") (1953), and Amori di mezzo secolo (segment: "Napoli 1943") (1954). American studios soon followed with films like Quartet (1948) based on stories by W. Somerset Maugham. This led to two sequels, Trio (1950) and Encore (1951), as well as imitators like O. Henry's Full House (1952) and Actor's and Sin (1952).
Sometimes there is one "top-level" story, a framing device, which leads into the various "sub-stories", as in Tales of Manhattan (1942), Flesh and Fantasy (1943), Dead of Night (1945), and The Illustrated Man (1968). The former helped to popularize the format for horror films—although they had existed as far back as Unheimliche Geschichten (1919)—and British company Amicus made several such films in the 1960s and 1970s.
Michael Jackson's 1988 musical-fantasy film Moonwalker consisted of six short films, each based on a song from his album Bad. The centerpiece of the film is the short film Smooth Criminal which is based on the song by the same name. Joe Pesci co-stars in Smooth Criminal. The film was never released in theaters in the United States but it did run in theaters elsewhere.
The Red Violin (1998) could also be considered a portmanteau film, since the storylines revolve around the various owners of a precious sixteenth-century violin through the centuries. Similarly, 1964's The Yellow Rolls-Royce follows the owners of the titular vehicle.
Gene Kelly's 1956 all-dance film Invitation to the Dance consisted of three distinct stories, each different in tone and with its own plot line. Kelly appeared in each of the stories.
Four Rooms is also an anthology film which follows the protagonist and his misadventures in four different rooms of a hotel. The four different segments (or rooms) were all directed by different directors. 
Mohsen Abdolvahab's debut Please Do Not Disturb (2010) was a widely acclaimed tri-segmented Iranian anthology film.
Anthology films are often mistaken with hyperlink cinema. Hyperlink cinema shows bits of many stories throughout the movie, whereas anthology films show story segments of one at a time. Some mistaken examples include Pulp Fiction and Amores Perros, distributing their storylines non-chronologically, separated by segments.

An information society is a society where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The aim of the information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using information technology (IT) in a creative and productive way.  The knowledge economy is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.[tpl]cite book |title=The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |year=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press[/tpl]

Information society is seen as the successor to industrial society. Closely related concepts are the post-industrial society (Daniel Bell), post-fordism, post-modern society, knowledge society, telematic society, Information Revolution, liquid modernity, and network society (Manuel Castells).

Lights Out is the sixth studio album by the British rock band UFO, released in May and also on October 11, 1977 (see 1977 in music). All songs are band originals except for "Alone Again Or" which is a cover of a song by the band Love. 
The album was UFO's first to feature lush string arrangements alongside more complex song structures than their previous albums.  Producer Ron Nevison brought in Alan McMillan to handle the string and horn arrangements. The most notable song to feature the orchestral coloring was "Love to Love" which became one of the bands most successful singles.  
In 1994, a CD comprising this album and No Heavy Petting was released by BGO Records. 2008 EMI's remastered edition includes 4 live bonus tracks, recorded at The Roundhouse, London, the album cover states that these tracks were recorded in 1976 this is wrong, the tracks were recorded at The Roundhouse, London, in 1977. 
However EMI did get it right with the writing credits, with Paul Raymond at last being credited for his contributions.
The title track and "Love to Love" were featured in the 1999 movie Detroit Rock City. "Love to Love" was also covered by Djali Zwan for the 2002 movie Spun.
Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 28 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time".

Bounce is the eighth studio album by American rock band Bon Jovi, released on October 8, 2002 through Island Records. Produced by Luke Ebbin, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, the album was recorded at Sanctuary II Studio in New Jersey.
Bounce was heavily influenced by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, owing in part to Jon Bon Jovi's proximity to New York. The title "Bounce" was a reference to New York City's and the United States' ability to bounce back from the World Trade Center attacks as a nation. The cover image for the album includes a stylized image of a radio telescope dish at the Very Large Array.
The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite web|url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3734/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title = Allmusic (Bon Jovi charts & awards) Billboard albums|publisher=[/tpl] making it Bon Jovi's highest debut in the band's history at that time.

[[Watching the Wildlife]]
CATEGORIES: 1987 singles, Frankie Goes to Hollywood songs, Song recordings produced by Stephen Lipson, 1987 songs, ZTT Records singles

"Watching the Wildlife" is the seventh and last single by British pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Released in early 1987, it is taken from the album Liverpool. 
Of the singles culled from Liverpool, "Watching the Wildlife" is the most poppy and similar in sound to the band's early era material. However, the single only reached Number 28 in the UK singles chart and #23 in Germany. It is also the only one of the three Liverpool singles not to have a CD single release at that time (a cd single identical to the first 12 inch was released in 2002).
The 7" packaging made reference to animals, with a panda and dolphin on the sleeve. The cassette single made more references to sex. To wit, the instrumental mix was dubbed "The Condom Mix" on the cassette single. The promotional condom that was to be distributed with each single would have stopped the single sales counting towards the UK charts as the official chart provider had introduced new rules to this effect.
The single also featured a brand new track, "The Waves" on the b-side.

[[Formula]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematical notation

In science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically as in a mathematical or chemical formula. The informal use of the term formula in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given quantities. The plural of formula can be spelled either as formulas or formulae (from the original Latin).Oxford Dictionaries: formula.
In mathematics, a formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language. For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion; but, having done this once, mathematicians can produce a formula to describe the volume in terms of some other parameter (the radius for example). This particular formula is:
[tpl]math|big=1|V [tpl]=[/tpl] [tpl]sfrac|4|3[/tpl] π r3[/tpl]
Having obtained this result, and knowing the radius of the sphere in question, we can quickly and easily determine its volume. Note that the volume V and the radius r are expressed as single letters instead of words or phrases. This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate larger and more complex formulas. Mathematical formulas are often algebraic, closed form, and/or analytical.
In modern chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (−) signs.Atkins, P.W., Overton, T., Rourke, J., Weller, M. and Armstrong, F. Shriver and Atkins inorganic chemistry (4th edition) 2006 (Oxford University Press) ISBN 0-19-926463-5 For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water, specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. Similarly, O[tpl]sup sub|−|3[/tpl] denotes an ozone molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and having a net negative charge.
In a general context, formulas are applied to provide a mathematical solution for real world problems. Some may be general: [tpl]math|1=F = ma[/tpl], which is one expression of Newton's second law, is applicable to a wide range of physical situations. Other formulas may be specially created to solve a particular problem; for example, using the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay. In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for all calculations.
Expressions are distinct from formulas in that they cannot contain an equals sign (=).[ref]
</ref> Whereas formulas are comparable to sentences, expressions are more like phrases.

[[Aceraceae]]

CATEGORIES: Sapindaceae, Historically recognized angiosperm families

Aceraceae were recognized as a family of flowering plants also called the Maple Family.  They contain two to four genera, depending upon the circumscription, of some 120 species of trees and shrubs. A common characteristic is that the leaves are opposite, and the fruit a schizocarp.Aceraceae in L. Watson and M.J. Dallwitz (1992 onwards), The families of flowering plants.
The maples have long been known to be closely related to the family Sapindaceae. Several taxonomists (including the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group) now include both the Aceraceae and the Hippocastanaceae in the Sapindaceae. Recent research (Harrington et al. 2005Harrington, M. G., Edwards, K. J., Johnson, S. A., Chase, M. W., & Gadek, P. A. (2005). Phylogenetic inference in Sapindaceae sensu lato using plastid matK and rbcL DNA sequences. Systematic Botany 30: 366-382. Abstract.) has shown that while both Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae are monophyletic in themselves, their removal from Sapindaceae sensu lato would leave Sapindaceae sensu stricto as a paraphyletic group, particularly with reference to the genus Xanthoceras.

The Mosque of Omar ([tpl]lang-ar|مسجد عمر بن الخطاب[/tpl]) in Jerusalem is located opposite the southern courtyard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Muristan. After the Siege of Jerusalem in 637 by the Rashidun army under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Patriarch Sophronius refused to surrender except to the Caliph Omar (579-644) himself. Omar traveled to Jerusalem and accepted the surrender. He then visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where Sophronius invited him to pray inside the Church, but Omar declined so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the Church's status as a Christian site. Instead he prayed outside in the courtyard, in a place where David was believed to have prayed.
The Mosque of Omar was built in its current shape by the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din in 1193 in memory of this event. It has a [tpl]convert|15|m[/tpl] high minaret that was built before 1465 and was renovated by Ottoman sultan Abdulmecid I (1839–1860).

Gustave Le Bon (7 May 1841 – 13 December 1931) was a French social psychologist, sociologist, anthropologist, inventor, and amateur physicist. He is best known for his 1895 work The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind. His writings incorporate theories of national traits, racial superiority, herd behavior and crowd psychology.
Le Bon began his writing career working in the new field of anthropology. In the 1870s he invented a pocket cephalometer, or as he called it, a "Compass of Coordinates", which was an instrument that allowed one to quickly measure the head's various angles, diameters, and profiles. In effect, the instrument was able to reproduce the measurements of any 3-D solid figure. Because it was small and portable the device was easily incorporated into the research programs of anthropologists. Le Bon himself, in 1881, used the cephalometer to measure the heads of 50 inhabitants of the remote Tatras Mountains region of southern Poland. His paper, "The Pocket Cephalometer, or Compass of Coordinates" is written in the style of a user's manual, and stands as an important historical document that details how 19th Century anthropologists initially practiced their science.
Le Bon's physical theories generated some mild controversy in the physics community. In 1896 he reported observing a new kind of radiation, which he termed "black light".Nye, Mary Jo. (1974). "Gustave Le Bon’s Black Light: A Study in Physics and Philosophy in France at the Turn of the Century," Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences, Vol. 4., pp. 163-195. Not the same as what today people call black light, though it was later discovered not to exist.Kragh, Helge (1999). Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press): 11–12. His theory of the nature of matter and energy was expanded upon in his book The Evolution of Matter. The book was popular in France, going through 12 editions. The major premise of the book is matter is an inherently unstable substance and slowly transforms into luminiferous ether. One major supporter was Henri Poincaré,Crosland, Maurice (2002).

[[Logarithmic scale]]

CATEGORIES: Logarithmic scales of measurement

A logarithmic scale is a scale of measurement that displays the value of a physical quantity using intervals corresponding to orders of magnitude, rather than a standard linear scale. The function of the curve may include an exponent which is what gives it its curved nature.
A simple example is a chart whose vertical or horizontal axis has equally spaced increments that are labelled 1, 10, 100, 1000, instead of 0, 1, 2, 3. Each unit increase on the logarithmic scale thus represents an exponential increase in the underlying quantity for the given base (10, in this case).
Presentation of data on a logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values. The use of the logarithms of the values rather than the actual values reduces a wide range to a more manageable size. Some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (Weber–Fechner law), which makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular our sense of hearing perceives equal ratios of frequencies as equal differences in pitch.  In addition, studies of young children in an isolated tribe have shown logarithmic scales to be the most natural display of numbers by humans.[ref]

[[News style]]

CATEGORIES: Journalism, Newswriting

[tpl]More footnotes|date=December 2009[/tpl][tpl]Journalism[/tpl]
News style, journalistic style or news writing style is the prose style used for news reporting in media such as newspapers, radio and television.
News style encompasses not only vocabulary and sentence structure, but also the way in which stories present the information in terms of relative importance, tone, and intended audience.
News writing attempts to answer all the basic questions about any particular event—who, what, when, where and why (the Five Ws) and also often how—at the opening of the article. This form of structure is sometimes called the "inverted pyramid", to refer to the decreasing importance of information in subsequent paragraphs.
News stories also contain at least one of the following important characteristics relative to the intended audience: proximity, prominence, timeliness, human interest, oddity, or consequence.

[[Sexual ritual]]

CATEGORIES: Sexuality and society, Sexuality and religion, Religious behaviour and experience, Marriage

Sexual rituals fall into two categories: culture-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having developed sex rituals from evolutionary instincts for reproduction, which are then integrated into society, and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Arguably indeed, 'sex in its more ritualized and symbolic varieties...has moulded the shape of civilization'.Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape Trilogy (London 1994) p. 246 and p. 34
Sometimes sexual rituals are highly formalized and/or part of religious activity, as in the cases of Hieros gamos, the hierodule and the OTO. Contemporary sacred sexual rituals have been tagged as 'structured, symbolic, manifestation, ceremonies, tradition, everyday, habit, grounding, magic, solemn'."Sacred Sexual Rituals" p. 3

Jean Henri Gaston Giraud ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʒiʁo|lang[/tpl]; 8 May 1938 – 10 March 2012) was a French artist, cartoonist, and writer, who worked in the Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées tradition. Giraud earned worldwide fame, predominantly under the pseudonym Mœbius, and to a lesser extent Gir, which he used for the Blueberry series and his paintings. Esteemed by Federico Fellini, Stan Lee and Hayao Miyazaki among others, he received international acclaim.Screech, Matthew. 2005. Moebius/Jean Giraud: Nouveau Réalisme and Science fiction. in Libbie McQuillan (ed) "The Francophone bande dessinée" Rodopi. p. 1 He has been described as the most influential [tpl]lang|fr|bandes dessinées[/tpl] artist after Hergé.
His most famous works include the series Blueberry, created with writer Jean-Michel Charlier, featuring one of the first anti-heroes in Western comics. Under the pseudonym Moebius he created a wide range of science fiction and fantasy comics in a highly imaginative and surreal, almost abstract style, the most famous of which are Arzach, the Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius, and The Incal. Blueberry was adapted for the screen in 2004 by French director Jan Kounen. In 1997, Moebius and co-creator Alejandro Jodorowsky sued Luc Besson for using The Incal as inspiration for his movie The Fifth Element, a lawsuit which they lost.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=697 |title= Moebius perd son procès contre Besson |accessdate=20 January 2007 |date=28 May 2004 |language=French |work=ToutenBD.com [/tpl]

"Your eel, I think, Sir?"
Cartoon in Punch magazine: 28 July 1920]]
Politeness is best expressed as the practical application of good manners or etiquette. It is a culturally defined phenomenon, and therefore what is considered polite in one culture can sometimes be quite rude or simply eccentric in another cultural context.
While the goal of politeness is to make all of the parties relaxed and comfortable with one another, these culturally defined standards at times may be manipulated to inflict shame on a designated party.
Anthropologists Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson identified two kinds of politeness, deriving from Erving Goffman's concept of face:
Some cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In this way politeness is culturally bound.

[[United Kingdom cabinet committee]]

CATEGORIES: Government of the United Kingdom, Cabinet Office (United Kingdom)

The executive arm of the United Kingdom government is controlled by the Cabinet, a group of senior government ministers chaired by the Prime Minister. Most of the day-to-day work of Cabinet government is carried out by Cabinet committees, rather than by the full Cabinet. Each committee has its own area of responsibility, and their decisions are binding on the entire Cabinet.The Cabinet Manual: a guide to laws, conventions and rules on the operation of government (Cabinet Office, October 2011)
The details of the committee structure and membership are at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is free to reorganize committees and their responsibilities however he wishes, and can appoint or dismiss members freely. The sole limitation is the requirement that Cabinet ministers must be sworn members of the Privy Council, since the Cabinet itself is a committee of the Privy Council.
Although there have been many changes since the Cabinet committee system was first developed in the early twentieth century, the committees for foreign and military policy, domestic policy, economic policy, and the government's legislative agenda have been more or less permanent fixtures. These and many other committees are standing committees, which have a broad remit; others are ad hoc committees, which are established to deal with specific matters. Ad hoc committees are rarer now than throughout most of the twentieth century. Many matters are now expected to be resolved bilaterally between departments, or through more informal discussion, rather than requiring the formation of a committee.

The United States one-cent coin, commonly known as a penny, is a unit of currency equaling one one-hundredth of a United States dollar. The cent's symbol is ¢. Its obverse has featured the profile of President Abraham Lincoln since 1909, the centennial of his birth. From 1959 (the sesquicentennial of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the reverse featured the Lincoln Memorial. Four different reverse designs in 2009 honored Lincoln's 200th birthday and a new, permanent reverse – the Union Shield – was introduced in 2010. The coin is 0.75 inches (19.05 mm) in diameter and 0.061 inches (1.55 mm) in thickness.

A moral panic is an intense feeling expressed in a population about an issue that appears to threaten the social order.Jones, M, and E.  Jones. (1999). Mass Media. London: Macmillan Press  The term first appeared in the English language in 1830 in The Quarterly Christian Spectator.  Moral panics are in essence controversies that involve arguments and social tension, and in which disagreement is difficult because the matter at its center is taboo.Kuzma, Cindy. "Rights and Liberties: Sex, Lies, and Moral Panics". AlterNet. September 28, 2005; accessed September 5, 2008.  
The media have long operated as agents of moral indignation, even when they are not consciously engaged in crusading or muckraking.  Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety or panic.Cohen, S., p.16

It repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company.

[[United States Asiatic Fleet]]
CATEGORIES: Fleets of the United States Navy in World War II, Military units and formations established in 1902

The United States Asiatic Fleet was a fleet of the United States Navy during much of the first half of the 20th century. Preceding the World War II era, until 1942, the fleet protected the Philippine Islands. Much of the fleet was destroyed that year, after which it was dissolved and incorporated into the 7th Fleet.
The fleet was created when its predecessor, the Asiatic Squadron, was upgraded to fleet status in 1902. In early 1907, the fleet was downgraded and became the First Squadron of the United States Pacific Fleet. However, on 28 January 1910, the ships of that squadron were again organized as the Asiatic Fleet. Thus constituted, the Asiatic Fleet, based in the Philippine Islands, was organizationally independent of the Pacific Fleet, which was based on the United States West Coast until it moved to Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii in 1940.
Although much smaller than any other U.S. Navy fleet and indeed far smaller than what any navy generally considers to be a fleet, the Asiatic Fleet from 1916 was commanded by one of only four four-star admirals authorized in the U.S. Navy at the time. This reflected the prestige of the position of Asiatic Fleet commander-in-chief, who generally was more powerful and influential with regard to the affairs of the United States in China than was the American minister, or later United States Ambassador, to China.Foreword by Kemp Tolley in Winslow, p. xii.

The ABC 80 (Advanced BASIC Computer 80) was a home computer engineered by the Swedish corporation Dataindustrier AB (DIAB) and manufactured by Luxor in Motala, Sweden in the late 1970s (first model August 1978) and early 1980s. It was based on the Zilog Z80 running at [tpl]nowrap|3 MHz[/tpl] and had [tpl]nowrap|16 kB[/tpl] RAM, expandable to [tpl]nowrap|32 kB[/tpl], and [tpl]nowrap|16 kB[/tpl] ROM containing a fast semi-compiling BASIC interpreter.
ABC 80 normally used a dedicated (included) tape recorder for program and data storage, but could also be expanded to handle disk drives (and many other peripherals). Some sound effects could be produced by a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip which was connected to an 8-bit output port, but there was no way to control the chip's features in any detail, so sound was limited to 96 fixed sounds. The monitor was a black and white TV set modified for the purpose (an obvious choice since Luxor also made TVs). The computer had excellent I/O response times, something that was discovered when trying to upgrade to Personal computer. The solution was to use a microcontroller that communicated with a PC. The main unit had a reset button as well.
ABC 80 was also manufactured on license as BRG ABC80 by Budapesti Rádiótechnikai Gyár in Hungary. It used the same keyboard, but the case was metal instead of plastic.

[[Duration (music)]]

CATEGORIES: Aspects of music, Time

In music duration is an amount of time or a particular time interval. It is the length of a note. A duration is a property of a note that becomes one of the bases of rhythm.
A tone may be sustained for varying lengths of time. For example, an event in the common sense has a duration greater than zero (but not very long), but in certain specialized senses (such as in the theory of relativity), a duration of zero. It is often cited as one of the fundamental aspects of music, encompassing rhythm, form, and even pitch.
Durations, and their beginnings and endings, may be described as long, short, or taking a specific amount of time. Often duration is described according to terms borrowed from descriptions of pitch. As such, the duration complement is the amount of different durations used, the duration scale is an ordering (scale) of those durations from shortest to longest, the duration range is the difference in length between the shortest and longest, and the duration hierarchy is an ordering of those durations based on frequency of use.Winold, Allen (1975). "Rhythm in Twentieth-Century Music" (chapter 3), Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music. Delone and Wittlich (eds.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. ISBN 0-13-049346-5.
Durational patterns are the foreground details projected against a background metric structure, which includes meter, tempo, and all rhythmic aspects which produce temporal regularity or structure. Duration patterns may be divided into rhythmic units and rhythmic gestures (Winold, 1975, chap. 3). However, they may also be described using terms borrowed from the metrical feet of poetry: iamb (weak-strong), anapest (weak-weak-strong), trochee (strong-weak), dactyl (strong-weak-weak), and amphibrach (weak-strong-weak), which may overlap to explain ambiguity.Cooper and Meyer (1960).

Melk (older spelling: Mölk) is a city of Austria, in the federal state of Lower Austria, next to the Wachau valley along the Danube. Melk has a population of 5,257 (as of 2012). It is best known as the site of a massive baroque Benedictine monastery named Melk Abbey.
The town is first mentioned as Medilica in 831 in a donation of Louis the German; the name is from a Slavic word for 'border.'Johannes Binder, Travelling on the Danube (DDSG, 1987), p. 112. The area around Melk was given to Margrave Leopold I in the year 976 to serve as a buffer between the Magyars (called "Turks" in that time's sources) to east and Bavaria to the west. In 996 mention was first made of an area known as Ostarichi, which is the origin of the word Oesterreich (German for Austria). The bluff which holds the current monastery held a Babenberger castle until the site was given to Benedictine monks from nearby Lambach by Margrave Leopold II in 1089.  Melk received market rights in 1227 and became a municipality in 1898. In a very small area, Melk presents a great deal of architectural variety from many centuries.

[[Strategic lawsuit against public participation]]

CATEGORIES: Legal terms, Tort law, Lawsuits, Abuse of the legal system, Right to petition, Ethically disputed judicial practices, Strategic lawsuits against public participation

A strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) is a lawsuit that is intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.
The typical SLAPP plaintiff does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a legal threat. The difficulty is that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the Court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid good faith claims.
SLAPPs take various forms. The most common used to be a civil suit for defamation, which in the English common law tradition was a tort. The common law of libel dates to the early 17th century and (unusual in English law) is reverse onus, meaning, once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden was on the defendant to prove that it is not. The Defamation Act 2013 removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP in the United Kingdom by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including political libel (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably British Columbia and Ontario) where political views can be held as defamatory.
A common feature of SLAPPs is forum shopping, wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of perjury, refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for discovery, attempts to identify anonymous or pseudonymous critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

John Blow (baptised 23 February 1649 – 1 October 1708) was an English Baroque composer and organist, appointed to Westminster Abbey in 1669. His pupils included William Croft, Jeremiah Clarke and Henry Purcell. In 1685 he was named a private musician to James II.  His only stage composition, Venus and Adonis (ca. 1680–1687), was thought to influence Henry Purcell's later opera Dido and Aeneas. In 1687 he became choirmaster at St Paul's Cathedral, where many of his pieces were performed. In 1699 he was appointed to the newly created post of Composer to the Chapel Royal.

[[Secret society]]
CATEGORIES: Secret societies

A secret society is a club or organization whose activities, events, and inner functioning are concealed from non-members. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies, or guerrilla insurgencies, which hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence. The exact qualifications for labeling a group as a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group.
Anthropologically and historically, secret societies are deeply interlinked with the concept of the Mannerbund, the all-male "warrior-band" or "warrior-society" of pre-modern cultures (see H. Schurtz, Alterklassen und Mannerbunde, Berlin, 1902; A. Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, Chicago, 1960).
A purported "family tree of secret societies" has been proposed, although it may not be comprehensive.Stevens (1899), p. vii.
Alan Axelrod, author of the International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders, defines a secret society as an organization that:
David V. Barrett, author of Secret Societies: From the Ancient and Arcane to the Modern and Clandestine, uses slightly different terms to define what does and does not qualify as a secret society. He defines it as any group that possesses the following characteristics:
Barrett goes on to say that "a further characteristic common to most of them is the practice of rituals which non-members are not permitted to observe, or even to know the existence of." Barrett's definition would rule out many organizations called secret societies; graded teaching is usually not part of the American college fraternities, the Carbonari, or the 19th century Know Nothings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clérel de Tocqueville ([tpl]IPA-fr|alɛksi ʃaʁl ɑ̃ʁi kleʁɛl də tɔkvil|lang[/tpl]; 29 July 1805 – 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.
Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849–1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution.Paul R Hansen, Contesting the French Revolution (2009) p 3
He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV.  The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville  was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Video nasty was a colloquial term in the United Kingdom popularized by the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (NVALA)[tpl]cite web|title=Video Nasties |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/education-resources/education-news/video-nasties |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |accessdate=2013-12-23|date=2011-10-05[/tpl] to refer to a number of films distributed on video cassette in the early 1980s that were criticized for their violent content by the press, social commentators, and various religious organizations. These video releases were not brought before the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), which could have censored or banned many of the films, due to a loophole in film classification laws. As a result, this produced a glut of potentially censorable video releases, which led to public debate concerning the availability of these films to children due to the unregulated nature of the market.[tpl]cite web|title=Cannibal Holocaust|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/cannibal-holocaust |publisher=British Board of Film Classification|accessdate=2013-12-23|date=2011-10-05[/tpl]
Following a moral campaign led by Mary Whitehouse and the NVALA, local jurisdictions began to prosecute certain video releases for obscenity. To assist local authorities in identifying obscene films, the Director of Public Prosecutions released a list of 72 films the office believed to violate the Obscene Publications Act 1959. This list included films that had been acquitted of obscenity in certain jurisdictions or that had already obtained BBFC certification. The subsequent revisions to the list and confusion regarding what constituted obscene material led to Parliament passing the Video Recordings Act 1984, which forced all video releases to appear before the BBFC for certification.
The implementation of the Video Recording Act imposed a stricter code of censorship on videos than was required for cinema release. Several major studio productions were banned on video, as they fell within the scope of legislation designed to control the distribution of video nasties. In recent years, the stricter requirements have been relaxed, as numerous films once considered video nasties have obtained certification uncut or with minimal edits. Due to a legislative mistake discovered in August 2009, the Video Recordings Act 1984 was repealed and re-enacted without change by the Video Recordings Act 2010.

[[Bomber destroyer]]

CATEGORIES: Fighter aircraft

Historically, several aircraft were designated bomber destroyers prior and during the Second World War. They were interceptor aircraft dedicated to destroy enemy bomber aircraft with exceptionally powerful armament.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011|reason=At a minimum, a strict definition is needed: what was regarded a "bomber destroyer", and what was not. Otherwise this article will become cluttered with off-topic info.[/tpl] They were a generally intended for day use, so were a separate category from the existing night fighters.
The United States considered powerfully armed destroyers, like the Bell YFM-1 Airacuda prototype, to counter a potential attack of high-performance bombers. The Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Bell P-39 Airacobra were also design with the aim of mounting very heavy armament, including 37 mm guns, in the anti-bomber role.
A deceptively similar, although completely different, designation was the German Zerstörer (meaning "destroyer"). Introduced on 1 May 1939,[tpl]cite book| last = Weal| first = John| title = Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerstörer aces of World War 2| url = http://books.google.com/?id=PKa9EH5sb9gC&pg=PA85| year = 1999| publisher = Osprey Aviation| location = Oxford| isbn = 1-85532-753-8| pages = 6–7 [/tpl] the term did specifically exclude the defensive anti-bomber role (leaving it for the light fighters), and envisaged a heavy fighter for offensive missions: escorting the bombers, long-range fighter suppression, and ground attack.
Since then, improvements in both engine power and armament generally led to a loss of interest in this class for most nations. Even small fighters were able to carry enough firepower to effectively deal with enemy bombers. This remains true even today.

[[Optical communication]]
CATEGORIES: Optical communications, Telecommunications

Optical communication, also known as optical telecommunication, is communication at a distance using light to carry information. It can be performed visually or by using electronic devices. The earliest basic forms of optical communication date back several millennia, while the earliest electrical device created to do so was the photophone, invented in 1880.
An optical communication system uses a transmitter, which encodes a message into an optical signal, a channel, which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. When electronic equipment is not employed the 'receiver' is a person visually observing and interpreting a signal, which may be either simple (such as the presence of a beacon fire) or complex (such as lights using color codes or flashed in a Morse code sequence).
Free-space optical communication has been deployed in space, while terrestrial forms are naturally limited by geography, weather and the availability of light. This article provides a basic introduction to different forms of optical communication.

[[Free-net]]

CATEGORIES: Bulletin board systems, Internet service providers, Community networks

A free-net was originally a computer system or network that provided public access to digital resources and community information, including personal communications, through modem dialup via the public switched telephone network. The concept originated in the health sciences to provide online help for medical patients. With the development of the Internet free-net systems became the first to offer limited Internet access to the general public to support the non-profit community work.  The Cleveland Free-Net (cleveland.freenet.edu), founded in 1986, was the pioneering community network of this kind in the world.P.v.d.Besselar, S. Koizumi (Eds.), Digital Cities III. Information Technologies for Social Capital, ISSN 0302-9743, Springer (Berlin, 2005), p.190
Any person with a personal computer, or through access from public terminal in libraries, could register for accounts on a free-net, and was assigned an email address. Other services often included Usenet newsgroups, chat rooms, IRC, telnet, and archives of community information, delivered either with text-based Gopher software or later the World-Wide Web. 
The word mark Free-Net was a registered trademark of the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN), founded in 1989 by Tom Grundner at Case Western Reserve University. NPTN was a non-profit organization dedicated to establishing and developing, free, public access, digital information and communication services for the general public.http://old.cni.org/docs/infopols/NPTN.html It closed operations in 1996, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, prior use of the term created some conflicts.Trademark of Free-Net NPTN distributed the software package FreePort, developed at Case Western, that was used and licensed my many of the free-net sites.
The Internet domain name freenet.org was first registered by the Greater Detroit Free-Net (detroit.freenet.org), a non-profit community system in Detroit, Mi, and a member of the NPTN.  The Greater Detroit Free-Net provided other subdomains to several free-net systems during its operation from 1993 to approximately 2001.
Unlike commercial Internet service providers, free-nets originally provided direct terminal-based dialup, instead of other networked connections, such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). The development of Internet access with cheaper and faster connections, and the advent of the World-Wide Web made the original free-net community concept obsolete.
A number of free-nets, including the original Cleveland Free-Net, have shut down or changed their focus.  Free-nets have always been locally governed, so interpretation of their mission to remove barriers to access and provide a forum for community information, as well as services offered, can vary widely.  As text-based Internet became less popular, some of the original free-nets have made available PPP dialup and more recently DSL services, as a revenue generating mechanism, with some now transitioning into the community wireless movement.
Several free-net systems continue under new mission statements.  Rochester Free-Net (Rochester, New York), for instance, focuses on  hosting community service organizations (over 500 to date) as well as seminars about Internet use to the community at no charge.

Brutus, or Brute of Troy, is a legendary descendant of the Trojan hero Aeneas, known in medieval British legend as the eponymous founder and first king of Britain. This legend first appears in the Historia Britonum, a 9th-century historical compilation attributed to Nennius, but is best known from the account given by the 12th century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae. However, he is not mentioned in any classical text and is not considered to be historical.

The genus Nestor is one of two genera of the family Nestoridae.  Together with the  Kakapo in the Strigopidae tribe, they form the small parrot superfamily Strigopoidea. The genus Nestor contains two extant parrot species from New Zealand and two extinct species from Norfolk Island, Australia and Chatham Island, New Zealand, respectively. All species are large stocky birds with short squarish tails. A defining characteristic of the genus is the tongue, which is tipped with a hair-like fringe.[tpl]Cite book | first= Joseph M.| last= Forshaw| coauthors= Cooper, William T.|year= 1981|origyear=1973, 1978|edition=corrected second| title= Parrots of the World|publisher=David & Charles, Newton Abbot, London|isbn=0-7153-7698-5[/tpl] The superficial resemblance of this tongue to that of lorikeets has led some taxonomists to consider the two groups closely related, but DNA evidence shows they are not.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00199.x|last=Tokita |first=M|coauthors=Kiyoshi T and Armstrong KN |year=2007|title=Evolution of craniofacial novelty in parrots through developmental modularity and heterochrony.|journal=Evolution & Development|volume=9|issue=6|pages=590–601|pmid=17976055[/tpl]

[[Carnatic music]]

CATEGORIES: Carnatic music, Indian styles of music, South India, Classical and art music traditions

Carnatic music or Karnāṭaka Saṃgīta is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, with its area roughly confined to four modern states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. It is one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions; the other sub-genre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian and Islamic influences in North India. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style.
Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of [tpl]IAST|śruti[/tpl] (the relative musical pitch), [tpl]IAST|swara[/tpl] (the musical sound of a single note), [tpl]IAST|rāga[/tpl] (the mode or melodic formulæ), and [tpl]IAST|tala[/tpl] (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music. Carnatic music is also usually taught and learnt through compositions.
Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance. Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena. The most outstanding performances, and the greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians, are found in the city of Chennai.Carnatic music. (2007). In Encyclopedia Britannica.  Retrieved April 12, 2007, from Encyclopedia Britannica Online Various festivals are held throughout India and abroad which mainly consist of Carnatic music performances, like the Madras Music Season, which has been considered as one of the world's largest cultural events.The Music Academy Written by Malathi Rangaswamy, Secretary of Music AcademyNettl (2005), p38

[[Armand Zildjian]]

CATEGORIES: 1921 births, 2002 deaths, People from Quincy, Massachusetts, Colgate University alumni, Berklee College of Music alumni, American people of Armenian descent

Armand Zildjian (February 18, 1921 - December 26, 2002) was an American manufacturer of cymbals and the head of the Avedis Zildjian Company.
Born in Quincy, Massachusetts, Armand Zildjian was the scion of a cymbals-making tradition that dated back to his ancestor Avedis, who began the company in 1623 in Istanbul.  By family tradition, the secrets of cymbal making were passed on only to the oldest son, but Armand's father, Avedis Zildjian III, gave the information to both of his sons, Armand and Robert.  This began a legal battle which ended only when Robert formed the Sabian Cymbals Company, in competition with his brother.
Armand Zildjian attended Colgate University, and served with the United States Coast Guard in the Pacific during World War II.  After the war, he returned to his father's factory in Norwell, Massachusetts, where, with the help of such music business stars as Chick Webb and Gene Krupa, he revolutionized the cymbals business by adding them to drum sets and making them thinner.
Zildjian has an honorary degree from Berklee College of Music, is an inductee into the Percussive Hall of Fame, and has his name immortalized on the Guitar Center Rock Walk in Hollywood, California.
Armand has four children: Craigie, Debbie, Wendy, and Rab. Craigie is CEO of the Zildjian Company and Rab lives in England. More can be found on the Zildjian website.

The Catholic University of Leuven, (Louvain in French), was the largest, oldest and most prominent university in Belgium.[ref]Strictly speaking, the Old University of Leuven is the oldest, and the Catholic University of Leuven is identified as a continuation of it although they are legally separate. See the History section. But in reality several rules of the Belgian Courts, of Cassation and Appel, forbide the identification of the Catholic University with the Old University : "L'université catholique de Louvain ne peut être considérée comme continuant l'ancienne université de Louvain; et lorsqu'un acte de fondation a désigné pour collateur un professeur de cette ancienne université, il y a lieu d'y pourvoir par le gouvernement", (Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850, Bruxelles, 1855, p. 585, colonne 1, alinea 2.

During France's occupation of Belgium in the French Revolutionary Wars, the university closed by decree of the French Republic. After Belgium was annexed by the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the State University of Louvain was founded in 1816, lasting until 1835. In 1834, a few years after Belgium gained its independence, the Catholic University of Leuven was re-founded, taking this new name, and it is identified with the Old University.
In 1968, the university split to form two institutions:

[[Balboa (dance)]]

CATEGORIES: Swing dances

Balboa today is commonly used both as a term to describe a fusion of dances that originated in Southern California during the 1920s and 1930s, and also referring to a specific dance from that era that was the original Balboa (sometimes also referred to as Pure-Bal). 
The original Balboa dance is a form of swing dance that started as early as 1915 and gained in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. It is danced primarily in close embrace, and is led with a full body connection. The art of Balboa is in the subtle communication between the lead and follow, including weight shifts, which most viewers cannot see. As a result, Balboa is considered more of a "dancer's dance" than a "spectator's dance". Its exact origins are obscure, especially as most of the original Balboa dancers have since died.
Balboa is danced to a wide variety of tempos. Because the basic step takes up such a small space, Balboa can be danced to fast music (over 300 beats per minute). Balboa is also danced to slow music (under 100 beats per minute), which allows more time for intricate footwork and variations.

Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus that infects plants, especially tobacco and other members of the family Solanaceae.  The infection causes characteristic patterns, such as "mosaic"-like mottling and discoloration on the leaves (hence the name). TMV was the first virus to ever be discovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that an infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was determined to be a virus.

[[Japanese name]]

CATEGORIES: Names by culture, Japanese-language surnames, Japanese given names

[tpl]nihongo|Japanese names|日本人の氏名|nihonjin no shimei[/tpl] in modern times usually consist of a family name (surname), followed by a given name. "Middle names" are not generally used.
Japanese names are usually written in kanji, which are characters of usually Chinese origin in Japanese pronunciation. The kanji for a name may have a variety of possible Japanese pronunciations, but parents might use hiragana or katakana when giving a birth name to their newborn child. Names written in hiragana or katakana are phonetic renderings, and so lack the visual meaning of names expressed in the logographic kanji.
Japanese family names are extremely varied: according to estimates, there are over 100,000 different surnames in use today in Japan. Common family names in Japan include Satō ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|佐藤[/tpl][/tpl]) (most common), Suzuki ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|鈴木[/tpl][/tpl]) (second most common), and Takahashi ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|高橋[/tpl][/tpl]) (third most common).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.japanese-name-translation.com/site/top500_Japanese_family_names.xls |title=Japanese name translations |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Japanese-name-translation.com |accessdate= [/tpl] (.XLS file). This diversity is in stark contrast to the situation in other nations of the East Asian cultural sphere, there being very few Chinese surnames (a few hundred common, 20 comprise half the population), and similarly Korean names (250 names, of which 3 comprise almost half the population) and Vietnamese names (about 100 family names, of which 3 comprise 60% of the population). This reflects different history: while Chinese surnames have been in use for millennia and were often reflective of an entire clan or adopted from nobles (with or without any genetic relationship) – and were thence transferred to Korea and Vietnam via noble names, modern Japanese family names date only to the 19th century, following the Meiji restoration, and were chosen at will. The recent introduction of surnames has two additional effects: Japanese names became widespread when the country had a very large population (over 30,000,000 during the early Meiji era – see Demographics of Imperial Japan) instead of dating to ancient times (population estimated at 300,000 in 1 CE, for instance – see Demographics of Japan before Meiji Restoration), and since little time has passed, Japanese names have not experienced as significant surname extinction as has occurred in the much longer history in China.[tpl]citation |title= Chinese Surnames and the Genetic Differences between North and South China |last1= Du |first1= Ruofu |first2= Yuan |last2= Yida |first3= Juliana |last3= Hwang |first4= Joanna L. |last4= Mountain |first5= L.

Surnames occur with varying frequency in different regions; for example, the names Chinen ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|知念[/tpl][/tpl]), Higa ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|比嘉[/tpl][/tpl]), and Shimabukuro ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|島袋[/tpl][/tpl]) are common in Okinawa but not in other parts of Japan; this is mainly due to differences between the language and culture of Yamato people and Okinawans. Many Japanese family names derive from features of the rural landscape; for example, Ishikawa ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|石川[/tpl][/tpl]) means "stone river", Yamamoto ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|山本[/tpl][/tpl]) means "the base of the mountain", and Inoue ([tpl]nowrap|[tpl]nihongo2|井上[/tpl][/tpl]) means "above the well".
While family names follow relatively consistent rules, given names are much more diverse in pronunciation and character usage. While many common names can easily be spelled or pronounced, many parents choose names with unusual characters or pronunciations, and such names cannot in general be spelled or pronounced unless both the spelling and pronunciation are given. Unusual pronunciations have especially become common, with this trend having increased significantly since the 1990s.佐藤 稔 『読みにくい名前はなぜ増えたか』 Minoru Sato, "Yominikui Namae wa Naze Fuetaka" ("Why We See More Hard-to-read Names"), 2007 For example, the popular boy's name 大翔 is traditionally pronounced "Hiroto", but in recent years alternative pronunciations "Haruto", "Yamato", "Taiga", "Sora", "Taito", "Daito", and "Masato" have all entered use.
Male names often end in -rō ([tpl]nihongo2|郎[/tpl] "son", but also [tpl]nihongo2|朗[/tpl] "clear, bright"; e.g. "Ichirō") or -ta ([tpl]nihongo2|太[/tpl] "great, thick"; e.g. "Kenta"), or contain ichi ([tpl]nihongo2|一[/tpl] "first son"; e.g. "Ken'ichi"), kazu (also written with 一 "first son", along with several other possible characters; e.g. "Kazuhiro"), ji ([tpl]nihongo2|二[/tpl] "second son" or [tpl]nihongo2|次[/tpl] "next"; e.g. "Jirō"), or dai ([tpl]nihongo2|大[/tpl] "great, large"; e.g. "Daiichi") while female names often end in -ko ([tpl]nihongo2|子[/tpl] "child"; e.g. "Keiko") or -mi ([tpl]nihongo2|美[/tpl] "beauty"; e.g. "Yumi"). Other popular endings for female names include -ka ([tpl]nihongo2|香[/tpl] "scent, perfume" or [tpl]nihongo2|花[/tpl] "flower"; e.g. "Reika") and -na ([tpl]nihongo2|奈[/tpl], or [tpl]nihongo2|菜[/tpl], meaning greens; e.g. "Haruna").

[[Name]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in logic, Lexicography, Names, Nomenclature, Philosophical logic

A name is a word or term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies a specific unique and identifiable individual person, and may or may not include a middle name. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes, more loosely, called names; an older term for them, now obsolete, is "general names". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or scientist can give an element a name.
Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another. A feudal naming habit is used sometimes in other languages: the French sometimes refer to Aristotle as "le Stagirite" from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to Shakespeare as "The Bard", recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language. Also, claims to preference or authority can be refuted:  the British did not refer to Louis-Napoleon as Napoleon III during his rule.

David Garrick (19 February 1717 – 20 January 1779) was an English actor, playwright, theatre manager and producer who influenced nearly all aspects of theatrical practice throughout the 18th century and was a pupil and friend of Dr Samuel Johnson. He appeared in a number of amateur theatricals, and with his appearance in the title role of Shakespeare's Richard III audiences and managers began to take notice.
Impressed by his portrayals of Richard III and a number of other roles, Charles Fleetwood engaged Garrick for a season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He remained with the Drury Lane company for the next five years and purchased a share of the theatre with James Lacy. This purchase inaugurated 29 years of Garrick's management of the Drury Lane, during which time it rose to prominence as one of the leading theatres in Europe. At his death, three years after his retirement from Drury Lane and the stage, he was given a lavish public funeral at Westminster Abbey where he was laid in Poets' Corner.
As an actor, Garrick promoted realistic acting that departed from the bombastic style that was entrenched when Garrick first came to prominence. His acting delighted many audiences and his direction of many of the top actors of the English stage influenced their styles as well. Furthermore, during his tenure as manager of Drury Lane, Garrick sought to reform audience behaviour. While this led to some discontent among the theatre-going public, many of his reforms eventually did take hold. In addition to audiences, Garrick sought reform in production matters, bringing an overarching consistency to productions that included set design, costumes and even special effects.
Garrick's influence extended into the literary side of theatre as well. Critics are almost unanimous in saying he was not a good playwright, but his work in bringing Shakespeare to contemporary audiences is notable. In addition, he adapted many older plays in the repertoire that might have been forgotten. These included many plays of the Restoration era. Indeed, while influencing the theatre towards a better standard he also gained a better reputation for theatre folk. This accomplishment led Samuel Johnson to remark that "his profession made him rich and he made his profession respectable."

The mods and rockers were two conflicting British youth subcultures of the early to mid-1960s. Media coverage of mods and rockers fighting in 1964 sparked a moral panic about British youths, and the two groups became labelled as folk devils.
The rocker subculture was  centred on motorcycling, and their appearance reflected that. Rockers generally wore protective clothing such as black leather jackets and motorcycle boots (although they sometimes wore brothel creeper shoes). The common rocker hairstyle was a pompadour, which was associated with 1950s rock and roll — the rockers' music genre of choice.Subcultures List - Mods and Rockers Retrieved 2012-2-14 The mod subculture was  centred on fashion and music, and many mods rode scooters.

Philip III Arrhidaeus ([tpl]lang-grc|Φίλιππος Γ' ὁ Ἀρριδαῖος[/tpl]; c. 359 BC – December 25, 317 BC) was a Greek king of Macedon from after June 11, 323 BC until his death. He was a son of King Philip II of Macedonia by Philinna of Larissa, allegedly a Thessalian dancer, and a half-brother of Alexander the Great. Named Arrhidaeus at birth, he assumed the name Philip when he ascended to the throne.
As Arrhidaeus grew older it became apparent that he had mild learning difficulties. In Plutarch's report, he became disabled by means of an attempt on his life by Philip II's wife, Queen Olympias - who wanted to eliminate a possible rival to her son Alexander - through the employment of pharmaka (drugs/spells); however, this claim is considered by most modern authorities as unlikely to be true.[tpl]cite book|author=Elizabeth Donnelly Carney|title=Olympias: mother of Alexander the Great|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jHZznr6PWTcC&pg=PA24|accessdate=14 June 2011|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-33316-0|pages=24–25[/tpl] Alexander was fond of him and took him on his campaigns[tpl]cite needed|date=June 2013[/tpl], both to protect his life and to ensure he would not be used as a pawn in a challenge for the throne.

[[Gravity wave]]
CATEGORIES: Fluid dynamics, Atmospheric dynamics, Waves, Water waves

In fluid dynamics, gravity waves are waves generated in a fluid medium or at the interface between two media which has the restoring force of gravity or buoyancy. An example of such an interface is that between the atmosphere and the ocean, which gives rise to wind waves.
When a fluid element is displaced on an interface or internally to a region with a different density, gravity will try to restore it toward equilibrium, resulting in an oscillation about the equilibrium state or wave orbit.[tpl]Citation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 9780521010450 | last = Lighthill | first = James |author-link = James Lighthill | title = Waves in fluids | year = 2001 | page = 205 [/tpl] Gravity waves on an air–sea interface of the ocean are called surface gravity waves or surface waves, while gravity waves that are within the body of the water (such as between parts of different densities) are called internal waves.  Wind-generated waves on the water surface are examples of gravity waves, and tsunamis and ocean tides are others.
Wind-generated gravity waves on the free surface of the Earth's ponds, lakes, seas and oceans have a period of between 0.3 and 30 seconds (3 Hz to 0.03 Hz). Shorter waves are also affected by surface tension and are called gravity–capillary waves and (if hardly influenced by gravity) capillary waves. Alternatively, so-called infragravity waves, which are due to subharmonic nonlinear wave interaction with the wind waves, have periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.

CATEGORIES: Tropical meteorology, Atmospheric dynamics, Climate patterns

The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a quasiperiodic oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies  in the tropical stratosphere with a mean period of 28 to 29 months. The alternating wind regimes develop at the top of the lower stratosphere and propagate downwards at about [tpl]convert|1|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] per month until they are dissipated at the tropical tropopause. Downward motion of the easterlies is usually more irregular than that of the westerlies. The amplitude of the easterly phase is about twice as strong as that of the westerly phase. At the top of the vertical QBO domain, easterlies dominate, while at the bottom, westerlies are more likely to be found.

A secondary circulation is a circulation induced in a rotating system.  For example, the primary circulation of Earth's atmosphere is zonal.  If however a parcel of air, that moves in a purely zonal direction, is accelerated or decelerated zonally, the Coriolis force will add a meridional component to its velocity.  This meridional circulation is then the secondary circulation.

The Avro Lancaster is a British four-engined Second World War heavy bomber designed and built by Avro for the Royal Air Force (RAF). It first saw active service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942 and, as the strategic bombing offensive over Europe gathered momentum, it became the main heavy bomber used by the RAF, the RCAF, and squadrons from other Commonwealth and European countries serving within the RAF, overshadowing its close contemporaries the Handley Page Halifax and Short Stirling.McKinstry 2009, pp. 9–10. The "Lanc", as it was affectionately known,Cotter 2005, p. XIII. thus became the most famous and most successful of the Second World War night bombers, "delivering 608,612 long tons of bombs in 156,000 sorties."Taylor 1969, p. 314.
The Lancaster, an evolution of the troublesome Avro Manchester, was designed by Roy Chadwick and was powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlins, or, in one version, Bristol Hercules engines.
A long, unobstructed bomb bay meant that the Lancaster could take even the largest bombs used by the RAF, including the [tpl]convert|4000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], [tpl]convert|8000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], and [tpl]convert|12000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] blockbusters, loads often supplemented with smaller bombs or incendiaries. The versatility of the Lancaster was such that it was chosen to equip 617 Squadron, and was modified to carry the Barnes Wallis designed Upkeep "Bouncing bomb" for Operation Chastise, the attack on Germany's Ruhr Valley dams.  Although the Lancaster was  primarily a night bomber, it excelled in many other roles, including daylight precision bombing: in the latter role some Lancasters were adapted to carry the [tpl]convert|12000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] Tallboy and, ultimately, the [tpl]convert|22000|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] Grand Slam earthquake bombs (also designed by Wallis)."Second World War propaganda film of "Grand Slam" in action." youtube.com.

As early as 1943, a Lancaster was converted to become an engine test bed for the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 turbojet. Lancasters were later used to test several different engines, including the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba and Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops, and the Avro Canada Orenda and STAL Dovern turbojets. Postwar, the Lancaster was supplanted as the RAF's main strategic bomber by the Avro Lincoln, itself a larger permutation of the Lancaster. Instead the Lancaster took on the role of long range anti-submarine patrol aircraft (later supplanted by the Avro Shackleton) and air-sea rescue. It was also used in roles as diverse as photo-reconnaissance and aerial mapping, as a flying tanker for aerial refueling, and as the Avro Lancastrian, a long-range, high-speed transatlantic passenger and postal delivery airliner. In March 1946, a Lancastrian of BSAA flew the first scheduled flight from the then new London Heathrow Airport."First to South America." Flight, 20 January 1946.

CATEGORIES: Inflorescence vegetables, Brassica oleracea, Cultivars, Edible plants

Cauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea, in the family Brassicaceae. It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed. Typically, only the head (the white curd) is eaten. The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds. 
Its name is from Latin caulis (cabbage) and flower,.[tpl]cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cauliflower | title = Cauliflower: definition | publisher = dictionary.com | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | year = 2006 [/tpl] Brassica oleracea also includes broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, though they are of different cultivar groups.
For such a highly modified plant, cauliflower has a long history.

[[Ship prefix]]

CATEGORIES: Ship prefixes

A ship prefix is a combination of letters, usually abbreviations, used in front of the name of a civilian or naval ship.
Prefixes for civilian vessels may either identify the type of propulsion, such as "SS" for steamship, or purpose, such as "RV" for research vessel. Civilian prefixes are often used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. Sometimes a slash is used to separate the letters, as in "M/S".
Naval prefixes came into use as abbreviations for longer titles, such as "His/Her Majesty's Ship" in the Royal Navy, abbreviated "H.M.S." and then "HMS". Earlier uses often included the type of vessel, as for instance "U.S.F." ("United States Frigate") for frigates of the United States Navy. Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as coast guards.
The use of ship prefixes is not universal; in particular neither the German Kriegsmarine nor the Imperial Japanese Navy used ship prefixes. Some English-language writers use prefixes like "DKM" (for "Deutsche Kriegsmarine") and "HIJMS" (for "His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Ship") or "IJN" (for "Imperial Japanese Navy", a translation of 大日本帝国海軍 dai-nippon teikoku kaigun) for consistency with "HMS" and "USS". Other writers follow the practice of the navy and omit any prefix.
From the 20th century onwards, most navies identify ships by hull numbers — identification codes typically painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses hull classification symbols, and the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use pennant numbers.
These tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.

{{Blacklisted-links|1=
Chicano rock is rock music performed by Mexican American (Chicano) groups or music with themes derived from Chicano culture. Chicano Rock, to a great extent, does not refer to any single style or approach. Some of these groups do not sing in Spanish at all, or use many specifically Latin instruments or sounds. The main unifying factor, whether or not any explicitly Latin American music is heard, is a strong R&B influence, and a rather independent and rebellious approach to making music that comes from outside the music industry.

Cochran was born in Minnesota and moved with his family to California in the early 1950s.

His first success came when he performed the song "Twenty Flight Rock" in the movie The Girl Can't Help It, starring Jayne Mansfield. Soon afterwards, Liberty Records signed him to a recording contract.
Cochran died aged 21 after a road accident, whilst travelling in a taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire, during his British tour in April 1960, having just performed at Bristol's Hippodrome theatre. Though his best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His songs have been covered by a wide variety of recording artists (see the "Style and Influence" section of this article for examples).

The cast features Scott Brady, James Hampton, Peter Donat, Richard Herd and Wilford Brimley. The film was directed by James Bridges and written by Bridges, Mike Gray and T. S. Cook.

The film was released on March 16, 1979, 12 days before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Coincidentally, in one scene, physicist Dr. Elliott Lowell (Donald Hotton) says that the China Syndrome would render "an area the size of Pennsylvania" permanently uninhabitable. The basis for the film came from a number of nuclear plant incidents and in particular the Brown's Ferry Alabama Nuclear Power Plant Fire which occurred four years earlier in 1975.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078966/trivia?item=tr1427991|title=The China Syndrome (1979) : Trivia|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=January 2014[/tpl]
"China Syndrome" is a fanciful term—not intended to be taken literally—that describes a fictional worst-case result of a nuclear meltdown, where reactor components melt through their containment structures and into the underlying earth, "all the way to China."

Herbert Blomstedt ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˌhæɹːbəʈ ˈblʊmːstɛt|lang[/tpl]; born July 11, 1927) is a Swedish conductor.
Herbert Blomstedt was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and two years after his birth, his Swedish parents moved the family back to their country of origin. He studied at the Stockholm Royal College of Music and the University of Uppsala, followed by studies of contemporary music at Darmstadt in 1949, Baroque music with Paul Sacher at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and further conducting studies with Igor Markevitch, Jean Morel at the Juilliard School, and Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood's Berkshire Music Center.
He won the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize in 1953 and the Salzburg Conducting Competition in 1955.[tpl]cite web|last=Stevenson |first=Joseph |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/herbert-blomstedt-q13670/biography |title=Herbert Blomstedt - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1927-07-11 |accessdate=2013-06-04[/tpl]
Blomstedt is most noted for his performances of German and Austrian composers, such as Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner and Richard Strauss, and also as a champion of Scandinavian composers, such as Edvard Grieg, Franz Berwald, Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen.
A devout Seventh-day Adventist, Blomstedt does not rehearse on Friday nights or Saturdays, the Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism. He does, however, conduct concerts, since he considers actual performances to be an expression of his religious devotion rather than work.
He has been Music Director or Principal Conductor of the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra (1954–1962), Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra (1962–1968), Danish Radio Symphony (1967–1977) and Swedish Radio Symphony (1977–1982). From 1975-1985, he served as chief conductor of the Dresdner Staatskapelle, in the process making many well-regarded recordings, including works of Richard Strauss and the complete Beethoven and Schubert symphonies, and leading the orchestra on international tours.
Blomstedt was music director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1985 to 1995.  He led the orchestra on regular tours of Europe and Asia, and made numerous prize-winning recordings for London/Decca, winning two Grammy Awards, a Gramophone Award and a Grand Prix du Disque, as well as awards from Belgium, Germany and Japan.  After leaving San Francisco full-time, Blomstedt held principal conductorships with the North German Radio Symphony (1996–1998) and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (1998–2005).
Blomstedt is currently Conductor Laureate of the San Francisco Symphony and Honorary Conductor of the Bamberg Symphony, Danish National Symphony Orchestra, NHK Symphony, Swedish Radio Symphony and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
Crescent-shaped food breads have been made since the Middle Ages, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[tpl]cite book | title = "Qu'est-ce que la Bible? d'après la nouvelle philosophie allemande", translated by August Hermann Ewerbeck | year = 1850| page = 327 | quote = Hebrew women, in the time of Jeremiah, made in honor of the pagan goddess Astarte (queen of heaven, queen of the moon) cakes, probably in the form of a crescent. [/tpl]
Croissants have long been a staple of French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food,"Croissant Vite", Time 8 September 1980 and today 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries are frozen.Bertrand Rothé, "Il est bon mon croissant (surgelé)", Bakchich Info, 11 March 2008 http://www.bakchich.info/Il-est-bon-mon-croissant-surgele,02904.html Today, the croissant remains popular in a continental breakfast.

Clyde Lensley McPhatter (November 15, 1932 – June 13, 1972) was an American R&B and rock n' roll singer.  He was immensely influential, perhaps the most widely imitated R&B singer of the 1950s and 1960s,Robert Palmer, "Roy Brown, A Pioneer Rock Singer", The New York Times, May 26, 1981. making him a key figure in the shaping of doo-wop and R&B.  His high-pitched tenor voice was steeped in the gospel music he sang in much of his younger life.  He is best known for his solo hit "A Lover's Question".  McPhatter was lead tenor for The Mount Lebanon Singers, a gospel group he formed as a teenager,Arnold Shaw, Honkers And Shouters. The Golden Years Of Rhythm And Blues. New York: Crowell-Collier Press, 1978, p. 381. and later, lead tenor for Billy Ward and His Dominoes. McPhatter was largely responsible for the success the Dominoes initially enjoyed.  After his tenure with the Dominoes, McPhatter formed his own group, The Drifters, before going solo. Only 39 at the time of his death, he had struggled for years with alcoholism and depression and was, according to Jay Warner’s On This Day in Music History, "broke and despondent over a mismanaged career that made him a legend but hardly a success."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YEDbvGm9aw0/TUbkXarvdzI/AAAAAAAAADg/hDzYP9s2AH4/s1600/Clyde%2BMcPhatter.jpg&imgrefurl=http://davesmusicdatabase.blogspot.com/2011/06/clyde-mcphatter-r-legend.html&h=252&w=252&sz=10&tbnid=Ls0fJaYP7I16aM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=90&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dclyde%2Bmcphatter%2Bdeath%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&zoom=1&q=clyde+mcphatter+death&usg=__dUikYFLDPrDzD2bZzUCun8h9Lwo=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w-FQUKqNBemM2gWPp4CgDQ&ved=0CDEQ9QEwBjgK |title=Google Image Result|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=2012-12-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YEDbvGm9aw0/TUbkXarvdzI/AAAAAAAAADg/hDzYP9s2AH4/s1600/Clyde+McPhatter.jpg|title=Image |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-16[/tpl] At the time of his passing, Clyde McPhatter left a legacy of over 22 years of recording history.

CATEGORIES: Metallica albums, 1988 albums, Elektra Records albums, Vertigo Records albums, English-language albums, Albums produced by Flemming Rasmussen, Albums certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Thrash metal albums

...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records. It was their first album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, following the death of Cliff Burton in 1986. ...And Justice for All is musically progressive, featuring long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It was noted for its dry, sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the album's mixing process. The songs' dark lyrics have themes of political and legal injustice, as seen through the prism of war, censored speech, and nuclear brinkmanship.
The front cover depicts a statue of Lady Justice cracked, blindfolded, and bound by ropes with her breasts exposed and both of her scales filled with dollars. The words "…And Justice for All" are written in graffiti-like lettering to the right. The cover art was created by Stephen Gorman, based on a concept developed by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. The album was initially released on one vinyl disc, but soon after re-released (without additional tracks) as a double-album.
...And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics. It was included in The Village Voice[tpl]'[/tpl]s annual Pazz & Jop critics poll of the year's best albums, while the single "One" earned Metallica their first Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. It was also their best-selling album at that point and became the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the United States. The album was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 9, 2003, having shipped eight million copies in the US.

At the time of his birth, his paternal grandfather (Alexander II of Russia) was still the reigning Emperor of All the Russias. Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne following his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line, and in 1894 after the death of his father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir-presumptive to the throne. 
The birth of Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 temporarily moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei inherited the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia and was not expected to live. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel, to avoid scandal, but this did not stop Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought Natalia to St. Petersburg, where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying Natalia, in the hope that he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and Natalia left Russia to exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England.
After the outbreak of World War I, Michael returned to Russia, assuming command of a cavalry regiment. When Nicholas abdicated on [tpl]OldStyleDate|15 March|1917|2 March[/tpl], Michael was named as his successor instead of Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as Emperor, and following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.

In America, Stokowski performed with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony of the Air and many others.  He was also the founder of the All-American Youth Orchestra, the New York City Symphony, the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra and the American Symphony Orchestra.

SMPTE timecode is a set of cooperating standards to label individual frames of video or film with a time code defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers in the SMPTE 12M specification.  SMPTE revised the standard in 2008, turning it into a two-part document: SMPTE 12M-1 and SMPTE 12M-2, including important new explanations and clarifications.
Timecodes are added to film, video or audio material, and have also been adapted to synchronize music.  They provide a time reference for editing, synchronization and identification.  Timecode is a form of media metadata.  The invention of timecode made modern videotape editing possible, and led eventually to the creation of non-linear editing systems.

[[Tribute]]

CATEGORIES: International relations

A tribute (from Latin tributum, contribution) is wealth, often in kind, that one party gives to another as a sign of respect or, as was often the case in historical contexts, of submission or allegiance. Various ancient states exacted tribute from the rulers of land which the state conquered or otherwise threatened to conquer. In case of alliances, lesser parties may pay tribute to more powerful parties as a sign of allegiance and often in order to finance projects that benefited both parties. To be called "tribute" a recognition by the payer of political submission to the payee is normally required; the large sums, essentially protection money, paid by the later Roman and Byzantine Empires to barbarian peoples to prevent them attacking imperial territory, would not usually be termed "tribute" as the Empire accepted no inferior political position.  Payments by a superior political entity to an inferior one, made for various purposes, are described by terms including "subsidy".
The ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire is an example of an ancient tribute empire; one that made relatively few demands on its non-Persian subjects other than the regular payment of tribute, which might be gold, luxury goods, animals, soldiers or slaves.  However failure to keep up the payments had dire consequences.  The reliefs at Persepolis show processions of figures bearing varied types of tribute.
The medieval Mongol rulers of Russia likewise only expected tribute from the Russian states, which continued to govern themselves.  Athens received tribute from the other cities of the Delian League. The empires of Assyria, Babylon, Carthage and Rome exacted tribute from their provinces and subject kingdoms.  Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Indonesia and Central Asia.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yJPlCpzOY_QC&pg=PA315&dq=tribute#v=onepage&q=tribute&f=false|page=315|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History: To 1500|first= Craig A. |last=Lockard |publisher= Cengage Learning|year= 2007 |isbn=0-618-38612-2[/tpl]  The Aztec Empire is another example.  The Roman republic exacted tribute in the form of payments equivalent to proportional property taxes, for the purpose of waging war.
Tribute empires contrast with those like the Roman Empire, which more closely controlled and garrisoned subject territories.  A tributary state is one that preserves its political position and such independence as it has only by paying tribute.

Marcus and Rush from the novel by Paul Brodeur. It tells the story of a young fugitive who hides as a stunt double on the set of an anti-war movie whose charismatic director will do seemingly anything for the sake of his art.
It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Peter O'Toole), Best Director (Richard Rush), and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. However, due to its limited release, it never earned much attention from US audiences at large.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=91782&category=Articles |title=The Stunt Man: Overview Article |author=Paul Tatara |publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl] As O'Toole remarked in a DVD audio commentary, "The film wasn't released, it escaped."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/02/24/the_stunt_man_2003_dvd_review.shtml |title=The Stunt Man DVD (1980) |author=Almar Haflidason |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-10-28[/tpl]

The term Glass–Steagall Act usually refers to four provisions of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933 that limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations within commercial banks and securities firms.[tpl]harvnb|CRS|2010a|pp=1 and 5[/tpl].  Wilmarth 1990, p. 1161.  Congressional efforts to “repeal the Glass–Steagall Act” referred to those four provisions (and then usually to only the two provisions that restricted affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms). Those efforts culminated in the 1999 Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), which repealed the two provisions restricting affiliations between banks and securities firms.
The term Glass–Steagall Act is also often used to refer to  the entire Banking Act of 1933, after its Congressional sponsors, Senator Carter Glass (D) of Virginia, and Representative Henry B. Steagall (D) of Alabama.Wilmarth 2008, p. 560. This article deals with only the four provisions separating commercial and investment banking.  The article 1933 Banking Act describes the entire law, including the legislative history of the Glass-Steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking.  A separate 1932 law also known as the Glass–Steagall Act is described in the article Glass–Steagall Act of 1932.
Starting in the early 1960s federal banking regulators interpreted  provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act to permit commercial banks and especially commercial bank affiliates to engage in an expanding list and volume of securities activities.  By the time the affiliation restrictions in the Glass–Steagall Act were repealed through the GLBA, many commentators argued Glass–Steagall was already “dead.” Most notably, Citibank’s 1998 affiliation with Salomon Smith Barney, one of the largest US securities firms, was permitted under the Federal Reserve Board’s then existing interpretation of the Glass–Steagall Act. President Bill Clinton publicly declared "the Glass–Steagall law is no longer appropriate."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/money-power-wall-street/transcript-19/ |title=Money, power, and Wall Street: Transcript, Part 4, (quoted as "The Glass–Steagall law is no longer appropriate—") |publisher=PBS|date=April 24 and May 1, 2012; encore performance July 3, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]Citation|title=Transcript of Clinton remarks at Financial Modernization bill signing|publisher=U.S. Newswire |location=Washington, D.C.|date=November 12, 1999[/tpl] (“It is true that the Glass-Steagall law is no longer appropriate to the economy in which we lived. It worked pretty well for the industrial economy, which was highly organized, much more centralized and much more nationalized than the one in which we operate today.  But the world is very different.”)
Many commentators have stated that the GLBA’s repeal of the affiliation restrictions of the Glass–Steagall Act was an important cause of the late-2000s financial crisis.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.usc.edu/org/InsightBusiness/ib/articles/articlescontent/08_4%20Adrianna%20Smith.html | title =The Overlooked Culprit in the Credit Crisis | publisher =usc.edu[/tpl] Some critics of that repeal argue it permitted Wall Street investment banking firms to gamble with their depositors' money that was held in affiliated commercial banks.[tpl]Citation| title=Sold Out: How Wall Street and Washington Betrayed America | publisher =Consumer Education Foundation| date =March 2009 | url=http://www.wallstreetwatch.org/reports/sold_out.pdf[/tpl] Others have argued that the activities linked to the financial crisis were not prohibited (or, in most cases, even regulated) by the Glass–Steagall Act. Commentators, including former President Clinton in 2008 and the American Bankers Association in January 2010,  have also argued that the ability of commercial banking firms to acquire securities firms (and of securities firms to convert into bank holding companies) helped mitigate the financial crisis.

He starred alongside his family in the television series, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952–66), as well as co-starring alongside John Wayne and Dean Martin in Howard Hawks's western feature film, Rio Bravo (1959). He placed 53 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1957 and 1973 including "Poor Little Fool" which holds the distinction of being the first #1 song on Billboard magazine's then-newly created Hot 100 chart. He recorded 19 additional Top 10 hits and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 21, 1987.WhitburnBashe 284 In 1996, he was ranked #49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=TV Guide |volume= |issue=December 14–20 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=October 12, 2011 [/tpl]
Nelson began his entertainment career in 1949 playing himself in the radio sitcom series, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, Here Come the Nelsons. In 1957, he recorded his first single, debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the #1 album entitled Ricky. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, "Poor Little Fool", and in 1959 received a Golden Globe nomination for "Most Promising Male Newcomer" after starring in Rio Bravo. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs.
Nelson and Sharon Kristin Harmon were married on April 20, 1963, and divorced in December 1982. They had four children: Tracy Kristine, twin sons Gunnar Eric and Matthew Gray, and Sam Hilliard. On February 14, 1981, a son (Eric Crewe) was born to Nelson and Georgeann Crewe. A blood test in 1985 confirmed that Nelson was the child's father. Nelson was engaged to Helen Blair when both were killed in an airplane crash on December 31, 1985.

Arthur  is a 1981 comedy film written and directed by Steve Gordon. The film stars Dudley Moore as the eponymous Arthur Bach, a drunken New York City millionaire who is on the brink of an arranged marriage to a wealthy heiress, but ends up falling for a common working-class girl from Queens. It was the first and only film directed by Gordon, who died in 1982 of a heart attack at age 44.
Arthur earned nearly $96 million domestically, making it the fourth highest grossing film of 1981.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&sort=gross&order=DESC&&p=.htm|title=1981 Domestic Grosses |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=March 9, 2012[/tpl] It was notable for its title song, "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)", co-written by Christopher Cross, Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager and Peter Allen, and performed by Christopher Cross. The film was nominated for a total of four Academy Awards. Sir John Gielgud won Best Supporting Actor and the theme song won Best Original Song. 
Arthur was followed by a 1988 sequel, Arthur 2: On the Rocks, which was enough of a failure for star Dudley Moore to disown it. A poorly received remake starring Russell Brand was released in April 2011.

[[Magnetic dipole]]

CATEGORIES: Magnetostatics, Magnetism, Electric and magnetic fields in matter

A magnetic dipole is the limit of either a closed loop of electric current or a pair of poles as the dimensions of the source are reduced to zero while keeping the magnetic moment constant. It is a magnetic analogue of the electric dipole, but the analogy is not complete. In particular, a magnetic monopole, the magnetic analogue of an electric charge, has never been observed. Moreover, one form of magnetic dipole moment is associated with a fundamental quantum property—the spin of elementary particles.
The magnetic field around any magnetic source looks increasingly like the field of a magnetic dipole as the distance from the source increases.

[[Scorched earth]]

CATEGORIES: Aftermath of war, Environmental issues with war, Military tactics

A scorched earth policy is a military strategy which involves destroying anything that might be useful to the enemy while advancing through or withdrawing from an area. It is a military strategy where all of the assets that are used or can be used by the enemy are targeted, such as food sources, transportation, communications, industrial resources, and even the people in the area. The practice can be carried out by an army in enemy territory, or in its own home territory. It may overlap with, but is not the same as, punitive destruction of an enemy's resources, which is done for purely strategic/political reasons rather than strategic/operational reasons. It was most famously used by Joseph Stalin against the German Army in the Second World War,[tpl]Cite book|title = Hitler Moves East.|last = Carroll|first = Paul|year = 1966[/tpl] by William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in the American Civil War, by Lord Kitchener against the Boers, and by the Russian army during the failed Napoleonic invasion of Russia.
The strategy of destroying the food supply of the civilian population in an area of conflict has been banned under Article 54 of Protocol I of the 1977 Geneva Conventions. The relevant passage says:
 
 It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://deoxy.org/wc/wc-proto.htm |title=Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Convention, 1977 |publisher=Deoxy.org |date=1954-05-14 |accessdate=2011-03-23[/tpl]
Despite being prohibited, it is still a common military practice. The protocol only applies to those countries that have ratified it; notable countries that have not ratified it are Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India and Indonesia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&id=470&ps=P|title=State Parties/Signatories Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977.|publisher=ICRC|accessdate=5 December 2012[/tpl]

The Drifters are a long-lasting American doo-wop and R&B/soul vocal group. They were originally formed to serve as a backing group for Clyde McPhatter (of Billy Ward & the Dominoes) in 1953. 
According to Rolling Stone magazine, the Drifters were the least stable of the great vocal groups, as they were low-paid musicians[tpl]cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-drifters-20110420[/tpl] hired by George Treadwell, who owned the Drifters name. There have been 60 vocalists in the history of the Treadwell Drifters line,[tpl]cite web| title = Treadwell Presents The Drifters| url =http://www.thedrifters.co.uk/index.php[/tpl] including several splinter groups by former Drifters members (not under Treadwell's management). These groups are usually identified with a possessive credit such as "Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters", "Charlie Thomas' Drifters", etc. 
There are two notable versions of the Drifters. The first classic Drifters, formed by Clyde McPhatter, was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as "The Drifters" or "The Original Drifters".[tpl]cite web| title = The Drifters (Inducted 1998)| url =http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/the_drifters.html[/tpl] The second Drifters, featuring Ben E.

According to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame: "Through turmoil and changes, the (original) Drifters managed to set musical trends and give the public 13 chart hits, most of which are legendary recordings today." Matching that feat, subsequent formations of the Drifters managed to give the public 13 Billboard Hot 100 top 30 chart hits.

A [tpl]lang|fr|cause célèbre[/tpl] ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔː|z|_|s|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|b[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-fr|koz selɛbʁ|lang[/tpl], famous case, plural [tpl]lang|fr|causes célèbres[/tpl]) is an issue or incident arousing widespread controversy, outside campaigning and heated public debate.The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy; third edition, 2002. The term is particularly used in connection with celebrated legal cases.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language; fourth edition, 2000.
The term is a French phrase in common usage in English. In French, cause means, here, a legal case, and célèbre means "famous". The phrase originated with the 37-volume Nouvelles Causes Célèbres, published in 1763, which was a collection of reports of well-known French court decisions from the 17th and 18th centuries. While English speakers had used the phrase for many years, it came into much more common usage after the 1894 conviction of Alfred Dreyfus for espionage, which attracted worldwide interest. Often politicians and social gadflies will become involved in order to use the media attention surrounding the case to promote their own agendas.
It has been noted that the public attention given to a particular case or event can obscure the facts, rather than clarifying them. As one observer states, "the true story of many a cause célèbre is never made manifest in the evidence given or in the advocates' orations, but might be recovered from these old papers when the dust of ages has rendered them immune from scandal".John Humffreys Parry, "Whistler v. Ruskin: An Attorney's Story of a Famous Trial", in The Living Age ... (1921), Volume 308, p. 346.

Banking in the United States is regulated by both the federal and state governments. The five largest banks in the United States at December 31, 2011 were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/big-banks-now-even-too-bigger-to-fail| title=Big Banks: Now Even Too Bigger to Fail| last=Lynch| first=David J.| date=April 19, 2012| work=Bloomberg Businessweek| accessdate=2014-02-20[/tpl] In December 2011, the five largest banks' assets were equal to 56 percent of the U.S. economy, compared with 43 percent five years earlier.
The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.

[[Debenture]]

CATEGORIES: Debt

[tpl]Finance sidebar[/tpl] A debenture is a document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it, and it is a debt without collateral. In corporate finance, the term is used for a medium- to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money. In some countries the term is used interchangeably with bond, loan stock or note. A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing the fact that the company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest and although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company's capital structure, it does not become share capital.Legal Service India Senior debentures get paid before subordinate debentures, and there are varying rates of risk and payoff for these categories.
Debentures are generally freely transferable by the debenture holder. Debenture holders have no rights to vote in the company's general meetings of shareholders, but they may have separate meetings or votes e.g. on changes to the rights attached to the debentures. The interest paid to them is a charge against profit in the company's financial statements.

Goldsmiths, University of London is a public research university and a constituent college of the federal University of London, which specialises in the arts, designs, humanities, and social sciences. It was founded in 1891 as Goldsmiths' Technical and Recreative Institute by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in New Cross, London. It was acquired by the University of London in 1904 and was renamed Goldsmiths' College. The word College was dropped from its branding in 2006, but "Goldsmiths' College", with the apostrophe, remains the institution's formal legal name.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |title=Rebranding FAQs |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London |quote=it is now known as Goldsmiths, University of London.|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070225110856/http://www.gold.ac.uk/rebrand/faq.php |archivedate = 25 February 2007[/tpl]
The university has a distinguished history of contributing to arts and social sciences. Its Department of Art is widely recognised as one of Britain's most prestigious, producing the YBA's art collective and over 20 Turner Prize nominees. Goldsmiths is also famous for design, psychology, drama, sociology, music, media and cultural studies, languages and literature, visual cultures, anthropology and educational studies.
Nearly 20% of students come from countries outside the UK, and 52% of all undergraduates are mature students (aged 21 or over at the start of their studies). Around a third of students at Goldsmiths are postgraduate students.
In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise Goldsmiths came 9th in the UK for world-leading research (shown by the top 4* grade). The Department of Sociology performed particularly strongly, and was placed joint first with three other institutions. And in the Department of Media and Communications 80% of activity was in the highest two bands.

[[Chart]]
CATEGORIES: Infographics, Diagrams, Charts

A chart is a graphical representation of data, in which "the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart".Cary Jensen, Loy Anderson (1992). Harvard graphics 3: the complete reference. Osborne McGraw-Hill ISBN 0-07-881749-8 p.413 A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of qualitative structure and provides different info.
The term "chart" as a graphical representation of data has multiple meanings:
Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data that they are produced from. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on graph paper) or by computer using a charting application. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents percentages in different groups (such as "satisfied, not satisfied, unsure") are often displayed in a pie chart, but may be more easily understood when presented in a horizontal bar chart.Howard Wainer (1997) 'Visual revelations: graphical tales of fate and deception from Napoleon Bonaparte to Ross Perot'',Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. ISBN 0-8058-3878-3 p.87-90 On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as "annual revenue from 1990 to 2000") might be best shown as a line chart.

CATEGORIES: IBM minicomputers

The IBM Series/1 computer is a 16-bit minicomputer, introduced in 1976, that in many respects competed with other minicomputers of the time, such as the PDP-11 from Digital Equipment Corporation and similar offerings from Data General and HP.  The Series/1 was typically used to control and operate external electro-mechanical components while also allowing for primitive data storage and handling.
Although the Series/1 uses EBCDIC character encoding internally and locally attached EBCDIC terminals, ASCII based remote terminals and devices could be attached via an I/O card with a RS-232 interface to be more compatible with competing minicomputers.  IBM's own 3101 and 3151 ASCII display terminals are examples of this.  This was a departure from IBM mainframes that used 3270 terminals and coaxial attachment and even preceded the IBM PC.
Series/1 computers were withdrawn from marketing in 1988.

[[Conceit]]

CATEGORIES: Literary concepts

In literature, a conceit is an extended metaphor with a complex logic that governs a poetic passage or entire poem. By juxtaposing, usurping and manipulating images and ideas in surprising ways, a conceit invites the reader into a more sophisticated understanding of an object of comparison. Extended conceits in English are part of the poetic idiom of Mannerism, during the later sixteenth and early seventeenth century.

Burke's most famous recordings, which spanned five years in the early 1960s, bridged the gap between mainstream R&B and grittier R&B.Greg Kot, "Solomon Burke Dead at 70; 'The King of Rock and Soul'", Chicago Tribune (October 10, 2010)  Burke was "a singer whose smooth, powerful articulation and mingling of sacred and profane themes helped define soul music in the early 1960s."Ben Sisario, "Solomon Burke, Influential Soul Singer, Dies at 70", The New York Times (October 11, 2010) He drew from his roots - gospel, jazz, country and blues - as well as developing his own style at a time when R&B, and rock were both still in their infancy.Pete Lewis, "Solomon Burke: The Last Soul Man", B&S 1038 (2010)  Described as both "Rabelaisian"Carlo Wolff, "Guralnick Studies Soul Music Roots," Schenectady Gazette (June 20, 1986):24. and also as a "spiritual enigma,"Tony Cummings, "Solomon Burke: The '60s Soul Music Legend and a Spiritual Enigma", Crossrhythms (November 5, 2010), "perhaps more than any other artist, the ample figure of Solomon Burke symbolized the ways that spirituality and commerce, ecstasy and entertainment, sex and salvation, individualism and brotherhood, could blend in the world of 1960s soul music."Brian Ward, Just my Soul Responding: Rhythm and Blues, Black Consciousness, and Race Relations (University of California Press, 1998):199.
During the 55 years that he performed professionally, Burke released 38 studio albums on at least 17 record labels and had 35 singles that charted in the US, including 26 singles that made the Billboard R&B charts. In 2001, Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a performer. His album Don't Give Up on Me won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003.

Simca (Société Industrielle de Mécanique et Carrosserie Automobile) (Mechanical and Automotive Body Manufacturing Company) was a French automaker, founded in November 1934 by Fiat and directed from July 1935 to May 1963 by Italian Henri Théodore Pigozzi (born Enrico Teodoro Pigozzi, 1898–1964). Simca was affiliated with Fiat and then, after Simca bought Ford's French activities, became increasingly controlled by the Chrysler Group.  In 1970, Simca became a subsidiary and brand of Chrysler Europe, ending its period as an independent company. Simca disappeared in 1978, when Chrysler divested its European operations to another French automaker, PSA Peugeot Citroën.  PSA replaced the Simca brand with Talbot after a short period when some models were badged as Simca-Talbots.
During most of its post-war activity, Simca was one of the biggest automobile manufacturers in France. The Simca 1100 was for some time the best-selling car in France, while the Simca 1307 and Simca Horizon won the coveted European Car of the Year title in 1976 and 1978, respectively — these models were badge engineered as products of other marques in some countries. For instance the Simca 1307 was sold in Britain as the Chrysler Alpine, and the Horizon was also sold under the Chrysler brand.
Simca vehicles were also manufactured by Simca do Brasil in São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, and Barreiros (another Chrysler subsidiary) in Spain.  They were also assembled in Chile, Colombia[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] and the Netherlands[tpl]cite web|url=http://members.home.nl/jurriaanknol/Simca4EN.htm |title=Simca and the Nekaf plant  |publisher=Members.home.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25[/tpl] during the Chrysler era.

[[Scattering]]

CATEGORIES: Concepts in physics, Scattering, Atomic physics, Nuclear physics, Particle physics, Radar theory, Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)

Scattering is a general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by one or more paths due to localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. Reflections that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections. 
Scattering may also refer to particle-particle collisions between molecules, atoms, electrons, photons and other particles. Examples are: cosmic rays scattering by the Earth's upper atmosphere; particle collisions inside particle accelerators; electron scattering by gas atoms in fluorescent lamps; and neutron scattering inside nuclear reactors. 
The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as scatterers or scattering centers, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes particles, bubbles, droplets, density fluctuations in fluids, crystallites in polycrystalline solids, defects in monocrystalline solids, surface roughness, cells in organisms, and textile fibers in clothing. The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory.
Some areas where scattering and scattering theory are significant include radar sensing, medical ultrasound, semiconductor wafer inspection, polymerization process monitoring, acoustic tiling, free-space communications and computer-generated imagery. Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics.

In mathematics, the nimbers, also called Grundy numbers, are introduced in combinatorial game theory, where they are defined as the values of nim heaps.  They arise in a much larger class of games because of the Sprague–Grundy theorem.  The nimbers are the ordinal numbers endowed with a new nimber addition and nimber multiplication, which are distinct from ordinal addition and ordinal multiplication.

[[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Theorems in the foundations of mathematics, Cardinal numbers, Articles containing proofs

In set theory, the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem, named after Georg Cantor, Felix Bernstein, and Ernst Schröder, states that, if there exist injective functions [tpl]nowrap|f : A → B[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|g : B → A[/tpl] between the sets A and B, then there exists a bijective function [tpl]nowrap|h : A → B[/tpl]. In terms of the cardinality of the two sets, this means that if |A| ≤ |B| and |B| ≤ |A|, then |A| = |B|; that is, A and B are equipollent. This is a useful feature in the ordering of cardinal numbers.
The theorem is also known as the Schroeder–Bernstein theorem,  the Cantor–Bernstein theorem, or the Cantor–Schroeder–Bernstein theorem. 
An important feature of this theorem is that it does not rely on the axiom of choice. However, its various proofs are non-constructive, as they depend on the law of excluded middle, and therefore rejected by intuitionists.[tpl]cite book |title=Mathematics and Logic in History and in Contemporary Thought |author=Ettore Carruccio |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2006 |page=354 |isbn=978-0-202-30850-0[/tpl]

Bismark is a town in the Stendal district, in the historic Altmark region of northern Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is situated approximately [tpl]convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west of Stendal.
In the early 12th century the area then under the rule of Albert the Bear was settled with peasants descending from the Low Countries. The town's name is derived from the nearby Biese creek (after [tpl]lang-nl|bies[/tpl] meaning rush plants), a tributary of the Aland; though it may also refer to the bishop's march, a possession of the Havelberg bishops mentioned in a 1209 deed issued by the Ascanian margrave Albert II. With the Altmark, Bismark was part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg until it was adjudicated to the Prussian Province of Saxony after the 1815 Congress of Vienna.
One Herbordus of Bismarck was mentioned holding the office of a Schultheiß in Stendal about 1270. His descendant Otto von Bismarck received the honorary citizenship of Bismark in 1895.
Upon an administrative reform effective from 1 January 2010, the town of Bismark comprises the former municipalities of Badingen, Berkau, Büste, Dobberkau, Garlipp, Grassau, Hohenwulsch, Holzhausen, Käthen, Kläden, Könnigde, Kremkau, Meßdorf, Querstedt, Schäplitz, Schernikau, Schorstedt and Steinfeld.

[[Annual cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Earth sciences

Annual cycle refers to the set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.
In biology, the annual cycle for plants and animals details behaviorial and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.McNamara, John M. and Houston, Alasdair I. (2008) "Introduction: Adaptation to the annual cycle" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences 363(1490): pp. 209–210
In religion, the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, Christianity has two annual cycles, the temporal cycle that tracks the events in the life of Christ, and the sanctoral cycle which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the temporal cycle.Flesher, Paul "Christian Time and Worship" Exploring Religions University of Wyoming
In climatology, an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in orbit over the course of the year.  Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming solar radiation at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. stratospheric westerlies and easterlies over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.
Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth.  If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an anomaly time series.

[[Semaphore (programming)]]

CATEGORIES: Concurrency control, Dutch inventions

In computer science, particularly in operating systems, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a parallel programming or a multi user environment.
A useful way to think of a semaphore is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to safely (i.e., without race conditions) adjust that record as units are required or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available. Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free from these problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores.
The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1965,[tpl]Cite EWD|123|Cooperating sequential processes[/tpl] (September 1965) and has found widespread use in a variety of operating systems.

CATEGORIES: Types of business entity, Business terms

A value-added reseller (VAR) is a company that adds features or services to an existing product, then resells it (usually to end-users) as an integrated product or complete "turn-key" solution. This practice occurs commonly in the electronics industry, where, for example, a VAR might bundle a software application with supplied hardware.[tpl]cite news|last=Marquit|first=Miranda|title=What is a Value Added Reseller?|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/services-value-added-reseller-var/1475-1.html|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=AllBusiness|date=August 23, 2012[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|title=What is a VAR?|url=http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid96_gci213274,00.html|publisher=SearchITChannel|accessdate=24 May 2013|date=July 2007[/tpl] 
The added value can come from professional services such as integrating, customizing, consulting, training and implementation. The value can also be added by developing a specific application for the product designed for the customer's needs which is then resold as a new package. VARs incorporate platform software into their own software product packages.[tpl]cite news|last=Lombard|first=Suzanne|title=ITEXPO Party Sponsor OnSIP's Mike Oeth on VAR and UC Trends|url=http://blog.tmcnet.com/monetizing-ip-communications/2012/09/onsip-mike-oeth-on-vars-itexpo.html|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=Monetizing IP Communications|date=September 12, 2012[/tpl]
The term is often used in the computer industry, where a company purchases computer components and builds (for example) a fully operational personal computer system usually customized for a specific task (such as non-linear video editing). By doing this, the company has added value above the cost of the individual computer components. Customers would purchase the system from the reseller if they lacked the time or experience to assemble the system themselves.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

[[Anomaly time series]]
CATEGORIES: Time series analysis, Climate and weather statistics

In atmospheric sciences and some other applications of statistics, an anomaly time series is the time series of deviations of a quantity from some mean. Wilks, D.S. (1995) Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric science, Academic Press. ISBN=0-12-751965-3 (page 42) Similarly a standardized anomaly series contains values of deviations divided by a standard deviation. Location and scale measures that are resistant to the effects of outliers are sometimes used as the basis of the transformation.
The location and scale parameters used in forming an anomaly time-series may either be constant or may themselves be time series. For example, if the original time series consisted of temperatures measured every hour, the effect of typical daily cycles of temperature might be remove by subtracting a time series containing mean temperature values for each hour of the day: clearly, this can be extended by including seasonal variations of temperature.
In the atmospheric sciences, the climatological annual cycle is often used as the mean value.  Famous atmospheric anomaly time series are for instance the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the North Atlantic oscillation index.  SOI is the atmospheric component of El Niño, while NAO plays an important role for European weather by modification of the exit of the Atlantic storm track.

[[Wavenumber]]

CATEGORIES: Wave mechanics, Concepts in physics

In the physical sciences, the wavenumber (also wave number) is the spatial frequency of a wave, either in cycles per unit distance or radians per unit distance. It can be envisaged as the number of waves that exist over a specified distance (analogous to frequency being the number of cycles or radians per unit time).
Because of the use of this term in applied physics, including spectroscopy, often the reference distance should be assumed to be cm.  For example, a particle's energy may be given as a wavenumber in cm−1, which strictly speaking is not a unit of energy. However if one assumes this corresponds to electromagnetic radiation, then it can be directly converted to any unit of energy, e.g. 1 cm−1 implies 1.23984×10−4 eV and 8065.54 cm−1 implies 1 eV.NIST Reference on Constants, Units and Uncertainty (CODATA 2010), specifically 100/m and 1 eV. Retrieved April 25, 2013.
In multidimensional systems, the wavenumber is also the magnitude of the wave vector.

[[Atmospheric waveguide]]

CATEGORIES: Atmosphere

An atmospheric waveguide is an atmospheric flow feature that improves the propagation of certain atmospheric waves.
The effect arises because wave parameters such as group velocity or vertical wavenumber depend on mean flow direction and strength.  Thus, for instance, westerlies might be a good waveguide for eastward-traveling waves, but might strongly dissipate westward-traveling waves, by increasing or decreasing their vertical wavenumber, respectively.  Modification of the waves' group velocity will change their meridional propagation speed, directing them more polewards or more equatorwards.

[[Dissipation]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics, Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Dynamical systems

Dissipation is the result of an irreversible process that takes place in inhomogeneous thermodynamic systems. A dissipative process is a process in which energy (internal, bulk flow kinetic, or system potential) is transformed from some initial form to some final form; the capacity of the final form to do mechanical work is less than that of the initial form. For example, heat transfer is dissipative because it is a transfer of internal energy from a hotter body to a colder one. Following the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy varies with temperature (reduces the capacity of the combination of the two bodies to do mechanical work), but never decreases in an isolated system.
These processes produce entropy (see entropy production) at a certain rate. The entropy production rate times ambient temperature gives the dissipated power. Important examples of irreversible processes are: heat flow through a thermal resistance, fluid flow through a flow resistance, diffusion (mixing), chemical reactions, and electrical current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).

CATEGORIES: Western swing songs, Songs written by Bob Wills, 1856 compositions, 1938 songs

"A Maiden's Prayer" (original Polish title: Modlitwa dziewicy Op. 4, French: La prière d'une vierge) is a composition of Polish composer Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska (1834–1861), which was published in 1856 in Warsaw, and then as a supplement to the Revue et gazette musicale de Paris in 1859. The piece is a medium difficulty short piano piece for intermediate pianists. Some have liked it for its charming and romantic melody; others have described it as "sentimental salon tosh." The pianist and academic Arthur Loesser described it as "this dowdy product of ineptitude."
John Stowell Adams (d. 1893) wrote the first English language lyrics for the piece.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

Ma Rainey (born Gertrude Pridgett; c. April 26, 1886 – December 22, 1939) was one of the earliest known American professional blues singers and one of the first generation of such singers to record.[tpl]cite book|last=Southern|first=Eileen|authorlink=Eileen Southern|year=1997|title=The Music of Black Americans: A History|edition=3rd edition|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=0-393-97141-4[/tpl] She was billed as The Mother of the Blues.
She began performing as a young teenager (between the ages of 12 and 14), and recorded under the name Ma Rainey after she and Will Rainey were married in 1904. They toured with F.S. Wolcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels and later formed their own group called Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues. From the time of her first recording in 1923 to five years later, Ma Rainey made over 100 recordings, including "Bo-weevil Blues" (1923), "Moonshine Blues" (1923), "See See Rider" (1924), "Black Bottom" (1927), and "Soon This Morning" (1927).[tpl]cite book|last=Lieb|first=Sandra|year=1983|title=Mother of the Blues: A Study of Ma Rainey|edition=3rd|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-394-7[/tpl]
Ma Rainey was known for her very powerful vocal abilities, energetic disposition, majestic phrasing, and a ‘moaning’ style of singing similar to folk tradition. Her powerful voice was never adequately captured on her records, due to her recording exclusively for Paramount, which was at the time known for its below-average recording techniques and poor shellac quality. However, Rainey's other qualities are present and most evident in her early recordings, Bo-weevil Blues and Moonshine Blues. 
Rainey recorded with Louis Armstrong in addition to touring and recording with the Georgia Jazz Band. She continued to tour until 1935 when she retired to her hometown.

[[Storm track]]

CATEGORIES: Midlatitude weather

Storm tracks  are the relatively narrow zones in the Atlantic and Pacific along which most Atlantic or Pacific extratropical cyclones or tropical cyclones travel.
The storm tracks usually begin in the westernmost parts of Atlantic and Pacific, where the large temperature contrasts between land and sea cause cyclones to form, particularly in winter. Surface friction cause these cyclones to quickly fill up and decay as soon as they reach land at the eastern end of the basins, accounting for the easternmost edges of the storm tracks.
Another example of a storm track is the circumpolar storm track in the Antarctic, however land-sea contrasts play no role in its formation.
Given a grid point field of geopotential height, storm tracks can be visualized by contouring its average standard deviation, after the data has been band-pass filtered.

A general circulation model (GCM), a type of climate model, is a mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean and based on the Navier–Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for complex computer programs commonly used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of global climate models along with sea ice and land-surface components. GCMs and global climate models are widely applied for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and projecting climate change.  Versions designed for decade to century time scale climate applications were originally created by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html |title=: The First Climate Model |publisher=NOAA 200th Celebration |year=2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010 [/tpl] These computationally intensive numerical models are based on the integration of a variety of fluid dynamical, chemical, and sometimes biological equations.

Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionismhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postimpressionism) is the term coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to describe the development of French art since Manet. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.

[[Efficient-market hypothesis]]

CATEGORIES: 1900 introductions, Behavioral finance, Economic efficiency, Economic theories, Financial economics, Financial markets

In finance, the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), or the joint hypothesis problem, asserts that financial markets are "informationally efficient". In consequence of this, one cannot consistently achieve returns in excess of average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis, given the information available at the time the investment is made.
There are three major versions of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong". The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information. The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly  available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even  hidden or "insider" information.
Critics have blamed the belief in rational markets for much of the late-2000s financial crisis.[tpl]cite book | title=Myth of the Rational Market | last=Fox | first=Justin | year=2009 | publisher=Harper Business | isbn=0-06-059899-9[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/business/06nocera.html?scp=1&sq=efficient%20market&st=cse|title=Poking Holes in a Theory on Markets|work=New York Times |accessdate=8 June 2009 |date=5 June 2009 | first=Joe | last=Nocera[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Roger |last=Lowenstein |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060502053.html |title=Book Review: 'The Myth of the Rational Market' by Justin Fox |work=Washington Post |accessdate=5 August 2011 |date=7 June 2009[/tpl]  In response, proponents of the hypothesis have stated that market efficiency does not mean having no uncertainty about the future, that market efficiency is a simplification of the world which may not always hold true, and that the market is practically efficient for investment purposes for most individuals.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.indexingblog.com/2011/03/27/efficient-market-hypothesis/ |title=Efficient Market Hypothesis |accessdate=2 June 2011 |date=27 March 2011 | first=Sameer |last=Desai [/tpl]

[[Geopotential height]]

CATEGORIES: Atmospheric dynamics

Geopotential height is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level — an adjustment to geometric height (elevation above mean sea level) using the variation of gravity with latitude and elevation. Thus it can be considered a "gravity-adjusted height". One usually speaks of the geopotential height of a certain pressure level, which would correspond to the geopotential height necessary to reach the given pressure.
The geopotential height is
Geophysical scientists often use geopotential height as a function of pressure rather than pressure as a function of geometric height, because doing so in many cases makes analytical calculations more convenient. For example, the primitive equations which weather forecast models solve are more easily expressed in terms of geopotential than geometric height. Using the former eliminates air density from the equations.
A plot of geopotential height for a single pressure level shows the troughs and ridges, Highs and Lows, which are typically seen on upper air charts. The geopotential thickness between pressure levels — difference of the 850 hPa and 1000 hPa geopotential heights for example — is proportional to mean virtual temperature in that layer. Geopotential height contours can be used to calculate the geostrophic wind, which is faster where the contours are more closely spaced and tangential to the geopotential height contours.
The National Weather Service defines geopotential height as
[tpl]Quotation|...roughly the height above sea level of a pressure level. For example, if a station reports that the 500 mb height at its location is 5600 m, it means that the level of the atmosphere over that station at which the atmospheric pressure is 500 mb is 5600 meters above sea level. This is an estimated height based on temperature and pressure data.[tpl]cite web|title=Height|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=h|work=NOAA's National Weather Service Glossary|publisher=NOAA National Weather Service|accessdate=15 March 2012[/tpl][/tpl]

[[Aksel Airo]]

CATEGORIES: 1898 births, 1985 deaths, People from Turku, People from the Grand Duchy of Finland, Finnish generals, People of the Finnish Civil War (White side), Finnish military personnel of World War II, Knights of the Mannerheim Cross

Aksel Fredrik Airo (1898, Turku – 1985) was a Finnish lieutenant general and main strategic planner during the Winter War and the Continuation War. He was the virtual second-in-command of the Finnish army under Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim. 
As a young man he became a supporter of Finnish independence. His father changed the original, Swedish, family name Johansson to Airo (lit. "oar").
During the Civil War in Finland (1918), Airo served in the artillery on the White side, taking part in battles near Viipuri. At the end of the war he was a lieutenant. Afterwards he was trained as an officer in Lappeenranta artillery school and was sponsored to the French military academy, École militaire in St.-Cyr in 1920. In 1921 he was accepted into École Supérieure de Guerre, the French officer training academy, from which he graduated as a captain in 1923, at the age of 27. Mannerheim invited him to join Finland's Defense Council as a secretary.
Airo rose swiftly in rank, mainly because newly independent Finland needed suitable officers for the fledgling army. He had, however, some professional challenges because he was neither a Germany-trained Jaeger officer, nor one of the officers trained in the Tsar's army during Russian rule. Still, by 1930 he had become a colonel. 
In the beginning of the Winter War, Mannerheim appointed Airo as Quartermaster-General, and he was promoted to major general, and two years later to lieutenant general. On November 18, 1944, Marshal Mannerheim made him a Knight of the Mannerheim Cross in Order of the Cross of Liberty.
Airo was in the Mikkeli headquarters during the war and rarely went to the field. He was responsible for operational planning and the presentation of operations, or, as he allegedly said, "The Marshal leads the war, but I lead the battles". They had many differences in opinion but still managed to work well together. 
After the Continuation War, the now Communist-dominated Valpo (the Finnish State Police) arrested him for his alleged involvement in the so-called Weapons Cache Case. He was imprisoned from 1945 to 1948 without being sentenced, until president Juho Kusti Paasikivi released him. He said little about the affair afterwards and earned the moniker "the silent general". The President relieved him of his duties with special permission to wear a military uniform.  
In his later life Airo was a member of the parliament for the National Coalition Party and a presidential elector. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he never wrote memoirs about his war experiences. In 1982 President Mauno Koivisto awarded Airo with the membership of the Finnish Order of the White Rose. He died in 1985 at his home farm.

[[Sensible heat]]

CATEGORIES: Atmospheric thermodynamics, Thermodynamics

Sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system that changes the temperature, and some macroscopic variables of the body, but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables, such as volume or pressure.Partington, J.R. (1949). An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry, Volume 1, Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases, Longmans, Green, and Co., London, pages 155-157.Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954). Chemical Thermodynamics, Longmans, Green & Co, London, pages 22-23.Adkins, C.J. (1975). Equilibrium Thermodynamics, second edition, McGraw-Hill, London, ISBN 0-07-084057-1, Section 3.6, pages 43-46.Landsberg, P.T. (1978). Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, Oxford University Press, Oxford, ISBN 0-19-851142-6, page 11.
The term is used in contrast to a latent heat, which is the amount of heat exchanged that is hidden, meaning it occurs without change of temperature. For example, during a phase change such as the melting of ice, the temperature of the system containing the ice and the liquid is constant until all ice has melted. The terms latent and sensible are correlative. That means that they are defined as a pair, depending on which other macroscopic variables are held constant during the process.
Sensible heat and latent heat are not special forms of energy. Rather, they describe exchanges of heat under conditions specified in terms of their effect on a material or a thermodynamic system.
In the writings of the early scientists who provided the foundations of thermodynamics, sensible heat had a clear meaning in calorimetry. James Prescott Joule characterized it in 1847 as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer.[ref]
, Lecture on Matter, Living Force, and Heat. May 5 and 12, 1847[/ref]
Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes while transporting energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with changes of state, measured at constant temperature, especially the phase changes of atmospheric water vapor, mostly vaporization and condensation, whereas sensible heat directly affects the temperature of the atmosphere.
In meteorology, the term 'sensible heat flux' means the conductive heat flux from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere.Stull, R.B. (2000). Meteorology for Scientists and Engineers, second edition, Brooks/Cole, Belmont CA, ISBN 978–0–534–37214–9, page 57. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget. Sensible heat flux is commonly measured with the eddy covariance method.

[[Latent heat]]

CATEGORIES: Thermochemistry, Atmospheric thermodynamics, Thermodynamics

Latent heat is the energy released or absorbed by a body or a thermodynamic system during a constant-temperature process. A typical example is a change of state of matter, meaning a phase transition such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The term was introduced around 1762 by Scottish chemist Joseph Black. It is derived from the Latin latere (to lie hidden). Black used the term in the context of calorimetry when referring to the heat transferred that caused a change of volume while the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature.
In contrast to latent heat, an energy is called a sensible energy or heat when it causes processes that do result in a change of the temperature of the system.

[tpl]nihongo|Kinbaku|緊縛|[/tpl] means 'tight binding' [tpl]nihongo|Kinbaku-bi|緊縛美|[/tpl] which literally means 'the beauty of tight binding'. Kinbaku is a Japanese style of bondage or BDSM which involves tying up the bottom using simple yet visually intricate patterns, usually with several pieces of thin rope (often jute, hemp or linen and generally around 6 mm in diameter, but sometimes as small as 4mm, and between 7–8m long). In Japanese, this natural-fibre rope is known as 'asanawa'; the Japanese vocabulary does not make a distinction between hemp and jute.   The allusion is to the use of hemp rope for restraining prisoners, as a symbol of power, in the same way that stocks or manacles are used in a Western BDSM context.Jina Bacarr, The Japanese art of sex: how to tease, seduce, & pleasure the samurai in your bedroom, Stone Bridge Press, LLC, 2004, ISBN 1-880656-84-1, p.185

Mannerheim was born in the Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian Empire (name in [tpl]lang-rus|Густав Карлович Ма́ннергейм|r=Gustav Karlovich (lit."Karl's son") Mannerheim[/tpl]), into a family of Swedish-speaking aristocrats who had settled in Finland in the late 18th century. His paternal German ancestor Marhein had emigrated to Sweden during the 17th century.Kaleva.fi, MTV3.fi His maternal ancestry has its roots in Södermanland, Sweden.[ref]"Julin von, Ätten härstammar från Säby i Österåkers socken i Södermanland, med namnet taget av grannsocknen Julita.

Mannerheim made a career in the Imperial Russian Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant general. He also had a prominent place in the ceremonies for Tsar Nicholas II's coronation and later had several private meetings with the Russian Tsar. After the Bolshevik revolution, Finland declared its independence but was soon embroiled in civil war between the pro-Bolshevik "Reds" and the "Whites," who were the troops of the Senate of Finland. Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites. Twenty years later, when Finland was twice at war with the Soviet Union from late 1939 until September 1944, Mannerheim successfully led the defence of Finland as commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces. In 1944, when the prospect of Germany's defeat in World War II became clear, Mannerheim was elected President of Finland and oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. (Finland was never at war with the United States.) He resigned the presidency in 1946 and died in 1951.

[[Mämmilä]]

CATEGORIES: Comic strips missing date information, Fictional populated places in Finland, Finnish comic strips

Mämmilä is a full-page comic strip by Finnish cartoonist Tarmo Koivisto and co-written by Hannu Virtanen.
Mämmilä is a fictional small country municipality, supposedly in the Häme region, and was originally modeled on the municipality of Orivesi. The cartoon depicted various contemporary issues in Finnish life, from various social changes to the coming of African refugees and membership in the European Union. The municipality has numerous colorful characters, from local political leaders and potentates to Varpu-Viljami (local dowser) and Mohammed al-Zomal (Somalian refugee). 
Unusually for comic strips, the storyline happens in real time, and the characters in Mämmilä age normally, at the same pace as the comic strip in real life. For example, a girl called Sari was born in the comic in 1980, and is now an adult punk-style girl. 
The strip was originally published 1974 in a Swedish-Finnish magazine, Suomen Sanoma (Finnish News) in Sweden. The magazine was published only a couple of times per year, so the strip moved to Finnish magazine called Me (We) in 1976. In 1983, Helsingin Sanomat began its monthly magazine, and Mämmilä moved in there. HS dropped the strip after 13 years, because the readers wanted a strip about life in Helsinki. Tarmo Koivisto still draws Tää kaupunki (This city) strip, written by various HS journalists.
In 2002, Tarmo Koivisto published a comic album WWW.MAMMILA.FI in which the Internet and shady business practices come to Mämmilä. It was under work for five years.
In late 2006, Suomen Kuvalehti, a weekly magazine wanted to publish Mämmilä. Because Koivisto has had many pages done for the next album after 2002, the storyline is not in real time right now, but eventually it will be.

Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt, Hinmatóowyalahtq̓it in Americanist orthography, popularly known as Chief Joseph, or Young Joseph (March 3, 1840 – September 21, 1904), succeeded his father Tuekakas (Chief Joseph the Elder) as the leader of the Wal-lam-wat-kain (Wallowa) band of Nez Perce, a Native American tribe indigenous to the Wallowa Valley in northeastern Oregon, in the interior Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
He led his band during the most tumultuous period in their contemporary history when they were forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the Wallowa Valley by the United States federal government and forced to move northeast, onto the significantly reduced reservation in Lapwai, Idaho Territory. A series of events which culminated in episodes of violence led those Nez Perce who resisted removal including Joseph's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe to take flight to attempt to reach political asylum, ultimately with the Sioux chief Sitting Bull in Canada.
They were pursued by the U.S. Army in a campaign led by General Oliver O. Howard. This [tpl]convert|1170|mi|-2|sing=on[/tpl] fighting retreat by the Nez Perce in 1877 became known as the Nez Perce War. The skill with which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which they conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity led to widespread admiration among their military adversaries and the American public.
Coverage of the war in United States newspapers led to widespread recognition of Joseph and the Nez Perce. For his principled resistance to the removal, he became renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker. However, modern scholars like Robert McCoy and Thomas Guthrie argue that this coverage, as well as Joseph's speeches and writings, distorted the true nature of Joseph's thoughts and gave rise to a "mythical" Chief Joseph as a "red Napoleon" that served the interests of the Anglo-American narrative of manifest destiny.

[[Wavenumber–frequency diagram]]

CATEGORIES: Wave mechanics, Diagrams

A wavenumber–frequency diagram is a plot displaying the relationship between the wavenumber (spatial frequency) and the frequency (temporal frequency) of certain phenomena. Usually frequencies are placed on the vertical axis, while wavenumbers are placed on the horizontal axis.[tpl]cite book| author = R.G. Fleagle, J.A.

In the atmospheric sciences, these plots are a common way to visualize atmospheric waves.
In the geosciences, especially seismic data analysis, these plots also called f-k plot, in which energy density within a given time interval is contoured on a frequency-versus-wavenumber basis.  They are used to examine the direction and apparent velocity of seismic waves and in velocity-filter design.

[[Atmospheric sciences]]

CATEGORIES: Atmospheric sciences, Fluid dynamics

Atmospheric sciences is an umbrella term for the study of the atmosphere, its processes, the effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere on these other systems. Meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting. Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic climate variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of planetary science and the study of the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system.
Experimental instruments used in atmospheric sciences include satellites, rocketsondes, radiosondes, weather balloons, and lasers.
The term aerology (from Greek ἀήρ, aēr, "air"; and -λογία, -logia) is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere. Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.http://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=Assman+stratosphere&source=bl&ots=YN13AEOnkN&sig=zwpdSVh0OW6UUToQoFzETgIudUc&hl=en&ei=H9feTuOkCYiQiAL4qfHPCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&sqi=2&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Assman%20stratosphere&f=false Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier

[[Kinhin]]

CATEGORIES: Buddhist terms, Zen terms, Buddhist meditation

In Zen Buddhism, kinhin ([tpl]CJKV|j=経行 kinhin|t=經行 jīngxíng|v=kinh-hành[/tpl]), or [tpl]nihongo|kyōgyō|教行[/tpl], is the walking meditation that is practiced between long periods of the sitting meditation known as zazen.
Practitioners walk clockwise around a room while holding their hands in shashu (叉手), with one hand closed in a fist, while the other hand grasps or covers the fist. During walking meditation each step is taken after each full breath. 
The beginning of kinhin is announced by ringing the bell twice (kinhinsho); the end by ringing once (chukaisho 抽解鐘 ‘the chime to let go and detach’).
In Chinese Zen, walking meditation is done with a wooden fish, whose rhythm one's footsteps follow. Each strike of the wooden fish is a step.
The pace of walking meditation may be slow (several steady steps per each breath) or brisk, almost to the point of jogging.
The terms consist of the Kanji kin (経 ‘to go through (like the thread in a loom)’, with ‘sūtra’ as a secondary meaning) and hin (行 ‘walk’). Therefore if taken literally, they mean ‘to walk straight back and forth.’ Although it can be translated loosely as meditative walking or walking meditation. Its meaning is similar to the idiom "walk-the-talk" as its literal meaning includes "walking to religious teachings" or "sutra walking", because the double meaning of the first character connotes walking the truth that is talked about in the sutras.

Cantharidin (etymology: Greek kantharis, beetle) is a powerful irritant vesicant (blister-inducing) substance obtained from many blister beetles, and sometimes given the nickname "Spanish fly."

Among the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature.
Transcendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—ultimately corrupt the purity of the individual. They have faith that people are at their best when truly "self-reliant" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.

CATEGORIES: Jet aircraft

A jet aircraft (or simply jet) is an aircraft (nearly always a fixed-wing aircraft) propelled by jet engines.
Whereas the engines in propeller-powered aircraft generally achieve their maximum efficiency at much lower speeds and altitudes, jet engines and aircraft achieve maximum efficiency at speeds close to or even well above the speed of sound. Jet aircraft generally cruise at faster than about M 0.8 and around [tpl]convert|10000|-|15000|m|ft[/tpl] or more.
Frank Whittle, an English inventor and RAF officer, developed the concept of the jet engine in 1928,http://www.cwn.org.uk/heritage/people/whittle/biography.html Hans von Ohain in Germany, a decade later developed the concept independently at the end of the 1930s. He wrote in February 1936 to Ernst Heinkel, telling him of the design and its possibilities. However, it can be argued that the English engineer A. A. Griffith, who published a paper in July 1926 on compressors and turbines, also deserves credit.

Opinion polls following his resignation suggested that Raffarin was one of France's least popular prime ministers since the Fifth Republic was established in 1958. However, according to the book "France: 1815–2003", written by Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godwin, Raffarin was "a remarkably popular prime minister" despite his ability "to state the obvious and to make empty statements".
Raffarin is married to Anne-Marie Perrier (b. 1952 in Chamalières) and has a daughter, Fleur.

CFNY-FM, promoted under the branding 102.1 The Edge, is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 102.1 FM in the Greater Toronto Area. The station rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s due to its freestyle DJing format and unique (at that point) choice to play alternative music. Following a number of years hallmarked by internal problems and a listener rebellion as a result of management decisions, the station eventually evolved into its current format of conventional modern rock. The radio station is currently owned by Corus Entertainment. The station's studios are based in downtown Toronto, Ontario at Corus Quay.
From 2004-2008, the station's program director was longtime on-air personality and notable Canadian radio personality Alan Cross.

Because her husband’s reign in Bohemia lasted for just one winter, Elizabeth is often referred to as The Winter Queen. She was the second child and eldest daughter of James VI and I, King of Scots, England and Ireland, and his wife Anne of Denmark.
With the demise of the Stuart dynasty in 1714, her grandson succeeded to the British throne as George I of Great Britain, initiating the House of Hanover line of succession. The reigning British monarch, Elizabeth II, is Elizabeth Stuart's direct descendant of the eleventh generation.

Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by prog and hard rock, with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate were part of the first wave of black metal in the early to mid-1980s. Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Since the band's inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate have released seven studio albums, two extended plays and four compilations.
After several line-up changes and self-made demos, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (guitar), Michael Denner (guitar), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up the group recorded their first two studio albums (1983's Melissa and 1984's Don't Break the Oath), until 1985 when the band broke-up due to musical differences. In 1993, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album In the Shadows, which was released the same year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Since 1999, Mercyful Fate have been on hiatus, but have reunited on occasion during the 2000s.

[[Prognostic variable]]
CATEGORIES: Numerical climate and weather models

A prognostic variable is a variable that a computer model predicts by integration of a physical equation, typically vorticity, divergence, temperature, surface pressure, and water vapour concentration in atmospheric models.
The term prognostic is given to some values or variables that are directly predictive by the model, such as temperature, water vapour, salinity, depth in atmospheric or ocean models; variables that can be directly obtained as a model outcome. On the other hand, there are some other variables that need to be calculated separately as derived variables, such as relative humidity which may be a diagnostic variable obtained from the model's prognostic variables, temperature and water vapour.

[[Nyquist frequency]]
CATEGORIES: Digital signal processing

The Nyquist frequency, named after electronic engineer Harry Nyquist, is ½ of the sampling rate of a discrete signal processing system.[tpl]cite book | title = Probability and Statistics: The Harald Cramér Volume | first= Ulf|last=Grenander|authorlink=Ulf Grenander | publisher = Wiley | year = 1959 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UPc0AAAAMAAJ&q=%22nyquist+frequency%22+date:0-1965&dq=%22nyquist+frequency%22+date:0-1965&pgis=1 | quote = The Nyquist frequency is that frequency whose period is two sampling intervals.[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title = Aerospace Telemetry | author = Harry L.

</ref>&nbsp;  An example of folding is depicted in Figure 1, where f<sub>s</sub> is the sampling rate and 0.5&nbsp;f<sub>s</sub> is the corresponding Nyquist frequency.  The black dot plotted at 0.6&nbsp;f<sub>s</sub> represents the amplitude and frequency of a sinusoidal function whose frequency is 60% of the sample-rate (f<sub>s</sub>).  The other three dots indicate the frequencies and amplitudes of three other sinusoids that would produce the same set of samples as the actual sinusoid that was sampled.  The symmetry about 0.5&nbsp;f<sub>s</sub> is referred to as ''folding''.
The Nyquist frequency should not be confused with the Nyquist rate, which is the minimum sampling rate that satisfies the Nyquist sampling criterion for a given signal or family of signals.  The Nyquist rate is twice the maximum component frequency of the function being sampled.  For example, the Nyquist rate for the sinusoid at 0.6 fs is 1.2 fs, which means that at the fs rate, it is being undersampled.  Thus, Nyquist rate is a property of a continuous-time signal, whereas Nyquist frequency is a property of a discrete-time system.
When the function domain is time, sample rates are usually expressed in samples/second, and the unit of Nyquist frequency is cycles/second (hertz).  When the function domain is distance, as in an image sampling system, the sample rate might be dots per inch and the corresponding Nyquist frequency would be in cycles/inch.

[[Don't Break the Oath]]

CATEGORIES: 1984 albums, Roadrunner Records albums, Mercyful Fate albums

Don't Break the Oath is Mercyful Fate's second full-length album. It was released in 1984.
The style Mercyful Fate employed on Don't Break the Oath resembled a mixture of heavy metal with progressive elements, lyrically preoccupied with Satan and the occult and distinguished by King Diamond's theatrical falsetto vocals. The album was remastered and subsequently re-issued on Roadrunner Records in 1997. This reissue came with the bonus track "Death Kiss (Demo)", which would eventually evolve into the album's lead-off track, "A Dangerous Meeting". Metal-Rules.com named this the greatest extreme metal album of all time.Metal-Rules.com

Frederick V ([tpl]lang-de|link=no|Friedrich V.[/tpl]; 26 August 1596 – 29 November 1632)http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Frederick_V,_King_of_Bohemia was Elector Palatine (1610–23), and, as Frederick I ([tpl]lang-cs|Fridrich Falcký[/tpl]), King of Bohemia (1619–20); for his short reign he is often nicknamed the Winter King (Czech: Zimní král; German: Winterkönig).
Frederick was born at the [tpl]lang|de|Jagdschloss[/tpl] [tpl]lang|de|Deinschwang[/tpl] (a hunting lodge) near Amberg in the Upper Palatinate. He was the son of Frederick IV and of Louise Juliana of Nassau, the daughter of William the Silent and Charlotte de Bourbon-Monpensier. An intellectual, a mystic, and a Calvinist, he succeeded his father as Prince-Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate in 1610. He was responsible for the construction of the famous Hortus Palatinus gardens in Heidelberg.
In 1618 the largely Protestant estates of Bohemia rebelled against their Catholic King Ferdinand, triggering the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War. Frederick was asked to assume the crown of Bohemia. He accepted the offer and was crowned on 4 November 1619.[tpl]cite web|last=Parker|first=Geoffery|title=Frederick V (elector Palatine of the Rhine)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/217973/Frederick-V|work=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=7 October 2012[/tpl]  The estates chose Frederick since he was the leader of the Protestant Union, a military alliance founded by his father, and hoped for the support of Frederick's father-in-law, James VI of Scotland and I of England. However, James opposed the takeover of Bohemia from the Habsburgs and Frederick's allies in the Protestant Union failed to support him militarily by signing the Treaty of Ulm (1620). His brief reign as King of Bohemia ended with his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620 – a year and four days after his coronation.
After this battle, the Imperial forces invaded Frederick's Palatinate lands and he had to flee to the Dutch Republic in 1622. An Imperial edict formally deprived him of the Palatinate in 1623. He lived the rest of his life in exile with his wife and family, mostly at The Hague, and died in Mainz in 1632.
His eldest surviving son Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine returned to power in 1648 with the end of the war. His daughter Princess Sophia was eventually named heiress presumptive to the British throne, and was the founder of the Hanoverian line of kings.

Les Nabis (pronounced nah-BEE) were a group of Post-Impressionist avant-garde artists who set the pace for fine arts and graphic arts in France in the 1890s. Initially a group of friends interested in contemporary art and literature, most of them studied at the private art school of Rodolphe Julian (Académie Julian) in Paris in the late 1880s.
In 1890, they began to successfully participate in public exhibitions, while most of their artistic output remained in private hands or in the possession of the artists themselves. By 1896, the unity of the group had already begun to break: The Hommage à Cézanne, painted by Maurice Denis in 1900, recollects memories of a time already gone, before even the term Nabis had been revealed to the public. Meanwhile, most members of the group—Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard—could stand, artistically, on their own. Only Paul Sérusier had problems to overcome—though it was his Talisman, painted at the advice of Paul Gauguin, that had revealed to them the way to go.

In the mythological traditions and creation accounts of Late Postclassic peoples such as the Aztec, Tamoanchan was conceived as a paradise where the gods created the first of the present human race out of sacrificed blood and ground human bones which had been stolen from the Underworld of Mictlan.Mesoamerican mythologies and creation myths in general suppose that there had been worlds previous to this one, which the gods had made and destroyed. The number of such previous worlds varies from tradition to tradition; a common conception among Late Postclassic central Mexican peoples held that there had been four rounds of creation previous to the current one.

[[Builder pattern]]
CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code

The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern. Unlike the abstract factory pattern and the factory method pattern whose intention is to enable polymorphism, the intention of the builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential list of constructors. Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
The builder pattern has another benefit. It can be used for objects that contain flat data (html code, SQL query, X.509 certificate...), that is to say, data that can't be easily edited. This type of data cannot be edited step by step and must be edited at once. The best way to construct such an object is to use a builder class.
Builder often builds a Composite. Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed. Sometimes creational patterns are complementary: Builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components are built. Builders are good candidates for a fluent interface.

[[Factory method pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code, Method (computer programming)

In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a  creational pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is done by creating objects via a factory method, which is either specified in an interface (abstract class) and implemented in implementing classes (concrete classes); or implemented in a base class, which can be overridden when inherited in derived classes; rather than by a constructor.

==Definition==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Prototype pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to:
To implement the pattern, declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual clone() method. Any class that needs a "polymorphic constructor" capability derives itself from the abstract base class, and implements the clone() operation.
The client, instead of writing code that invokes the "new" operator on a hard-coded class name, calls the clone() method on the prototype, calls a factory method with a parameter designating the particular concrete derived class desired, or invokes the clone() method through some mechanism provided by another design pattern.
The mitotic division of a cell — resulting in two identical cells — is an example of a prototype that plays an active role in copying itself and thus, demonstrates the Prototype pattern. When a cell splits, two cells of identical genotype result. In other words, the cell clones itself.Michael Duell, "Non-software examples of software design patterns", Object Magazine, Jul 97, p. 54

[[Composite pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code, Articles with example C Sharp code

In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern.  The composite pattern describes that a group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object.  The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.[ref]

[[Decorator pattern]]

In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern (also known as Wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the Adapter pattern) is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.[tpl]cite book|last=Gamma, et al.|first=Erich|title=Design Patterns|year=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Co, Inc.|location=Reading, MA|isbn=0-201-63361-2|pages=175ff[/tpl]

[[Proxy pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code, Articles with example C Sharp code

In computer programming, the proxy pattern is a software design pattern.
A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate.
A well-known example of the proxy pattern is a reference counting pointer object.
In situations where multiple copies of a complex object must exist, the proxy pattern can be adapted to incorporate the flyweight pattern in order to reduce the application's memory footprint. Typically, one instance of the complex object and multiple proxy objects are created, all of which contain a reference to the single original complex object. Any operations performed on the proxies are forwarded to the original object. Once all instances of the proxy are out of scope, the complex object's memory may be deallocated.

==Example==
End of paragraph.[]

[[Command pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code, Articles with example C Sharp code

In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to represent and encapsulate all the information needed to call a method at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.
Four terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and client. A command object has a receiver object and invokes a method of the receiver in a way that is specific to that receiver's class. The receiver then does the work. A command object is separately passed to an invoker object, which invokes the command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution.  Any command object can be passed to the same invoker object. Both an invoker object and several command objects are held by a client object.  The client contains the decision making about which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object. See example code below.
Using command objects makes it easier to construct general components that need to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing without the need to know the class of the method or the method parameters.  Using an invoker object allows bookkeeping about command executions to be conveniently performed, as well as implementing different modes for commands, which are managed by the invoker object, without the need for the client to be aware of the existence of bookkeeping or modes.

[[Iterator pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Articles with example PHP code, Articles with example Perl code, Articles with example C++ code, Iteration in programming

In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
For example, the hypothetical algorithm SearchForElement can be implemented generally using a specified type of iterator rather than implementing it as a container-specific algorithm. This allows SearchForElement to be used on any container that supports the required type of iterator.

[[Interpreter pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code

In computer programming, the interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. 
The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol (terminal or nonterminal) in a specialized computer language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to evaluate (interpret) the sentence.[ref]

[[Mediator pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns

In Software Engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.
Usually a program is made up of a large number of classes. So the logic and computation is distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are developed in a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes.
With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated with a mediator object.  Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby lowering the coupling.

[[Observer pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. The Observer pattern is also a key part in the familiar model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.[tpl]cite web|title=Model-View-Controller|publisher=MSDN|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649643.aspx|accessdate=01/06/2013[/tpl] In fact the observer pattern was first implemented in Smalltalk's MVC based user interface framework.Gang Of Four The observer pattern is implemented in numerous programming libraries and systems, including almost all GUI toolkits.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates, Head First Design Patterns, First Edition, Chapter 1, Page 24, O'Reilly Media, Inc, 2004. ISBN 978-0-596-00712-6 Strategy is one of the patterns included in the influential book Design Patterns by Gamma et al. that popularized the concept of using patterns in software design.
For instance, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use a strategy pattern to select a validation algorithm based on the type of data, the source of the data, user choice, or other discriminating factors. These factors are not known for each case until run-time, and may require radically different validation to be performed. The validation strategies, encapsulated separately from the validating object, may be used by other validating objects in different areas of the system (or even different systems) without code duplication.
The essential requirement in the programming language is the ability to store a reference to some code in a data structure and retrieve it. This can be achieved by mechanisms such as the native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation's internal storage of code via reflection.

[[Template method pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns, Articles with example Java code, Method (computer programming)

In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called template method, which defers some steps to subclasses.[ref]
</ref> It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.<ref>

[[Balking pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns

The balking pattern is a software design pattern that only executes an action on an object when the object is in a particular state. For example, if an object reads ZIP files and a calling method invokes a get method on the object when the ZIP file is not open, the object would "balk" at the request.  In the Java programming language, for example, an IllegalStateException might be thrown under these circumstances.
There are some specialists[tpl]who|date=November 2010[/tpl] in this field who think this is more of an anti-pattern, than a design pattern.  If an object cannot support its API, it should either limit the API so that the offending call is not available or so that the call can be made without limitation, it should:

[[Guarded suspension]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns

In concurrent programming, guarded suspension is a software design pattern for managing operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed. The guarded suspension pattern is typically applied to method calls in object-oriented programs, and involves suspending the method call, and the calling thread, until the precondition (acting as a guard) is satisfied.

[[Scheduler pattern]]

CATEGORIES: Software design patterns

In computer programming, the scheduler pattern is a software design pattern. It is a concurrency pattern used to explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code, like write operation to a file.
The scheduler pattern uses an object that explicitly sequences waiting threads. It provides a mechanism to implement a scheduling policy, but is independent of any specific scheduling policy — the policy is encapsulated in its own class and is reusable.
The read/write lock pattern is usually implemented using the scheduler pattern to ensure fairness in scheduling.
Note that the scheduler pattern adds significant overhead beyond that required to call a synchronized method.
The scheduler pattern is not quite the same as the scheduled-task pattern used for real-time systems.

[[Double-checked locking]]
CATEGORIES: Concurrency control, Software design patterns

In software engineering, double-checked locking (also known as "double-checked locking optimization"Schmidt, D et al. Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Vol 2, 2000 pp353-363) is a software design pattern used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the "lock hint") without actually acquiring the lock.  Only if the locking criterion check indicates that locking is required does the actual locking logic proceed.
The pattern, when implemented in some language/hardware combinations, can be unsafe. At times, it can be considered an anti-pattern.David Bacon et al. The "Double-Checked Locking is Broken" Declaration.
It is typically used to reduce locking overhead when implementing "lazy initialization" in a multi-threaded environment, especially as part of the Singleton pattern. Lazy initialization avoids initializing a value until the first time it is accessed.

[[Swing music]]

CATEGORIES: African-American music, African-American culture, African-American history, American styles of music, Jazz genres, Swing music

Swing music, or simply Swing, is a form of American music that developed in the early 1930s and became a distinctive style by 1940. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a "lilting" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the phrase ‘swing feel’ where the emphasis is on the off–beat or weaker pulse in the music (unlike classical music). Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement.
The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the Swing Era. The verb "to swing" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong rhythmic "groove" or drive.

Lanarkshire or the County of Lanark ([tpl]lang-gd|Siorrachd Lannraig[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sco|Lanrikshire[/tpl]) is a historic county in the central Lowlands of Scotland.
Historically, Lanarkshire was the most populous county in Scotland and, in earlier times, had considerably greater boundaries, including neighbouring Renfrewshire until 1402.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/counties/countyhistory17.html |title=Historical perspective for Old County of Lanarkshire |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12[/tpl] In modern times, it is bounded to the north by Stirlingshire and a detached portion of Dunbartonshire, to the northeast by Stirlingshire, West Lothian, to the east by Peeblesshire, to the southeast and south by Dumfriesshire, to the southwest by Dumfriesshire and Ayrshire and to the west by Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire. 
Lanarkshire was historically divided between two administrative areas then, in the mid-18th century, was divided again into three wards: the upper, middle and lower wards with their administrative centres at Lanark, Hamilton and Glasgow respectively and remained this way until the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.

[[Heavy fighter]]

CATEGORIES: Fighter aircraft

A heavy fighter is a fighter aircraft designed to carry heavier weapons or operate at longer ranges. To achieve acceptable performance, most heavy fighters were twin-engined, and many had multi-place crews.
The twin-engine heavy fighter was a major design class during the pre-World War II period. Conceived as long-range escort fighters, or heavily armed bomber destroyers, heavy fighters largely failed in their intended roles during World War II, as they could not outmaneuver the more conventional, single-engined fighters. Many twin-engined heavy fighters eventually found their niche as night fighters, with considerable successes. Only the Northrop P-61 Black Widow of the USAAF was ever built from the start, during the World War II era, solely to be a night fighter.

In particular, it emphasizes the separation of prokaryotes into two groups, originally called Eubacteria (now Bacteria) and Archaebacteria (now Archaea). Woese argued that, on the basis of differences in 16S rRNA genes, these two groups and the eukaryotes each arose separately from an ancestor with poorly developed genetic machinery, often called a progenote. To reflect these primary lines of descent, he treated each as a domain, divided into several different kingdoms. Woese initially used the term "kingdom" to refer to the three primary phylogenic groupings now referred to as "domains," until the latter term was coined in 1990.

[[Posttranslational modification]]
CATEGORIES: Gene expression, Protein structure, Protein biosynthesis, Posttranslational modification, Cell biology

Posttranslational modification (PTM) is a step in  protein biosynthesis. Proteins are created by ribosomes translating mRNA into polypeptide chains. These polypeptide chains undergo PTM (such as folding, cutting and other processes) before becoming the mature protein product.
A protein (also called a polypeptide) is a chain of amino acids. During protein synthesis, 20 different amino acids can be incorporated to become a protein. After translation, the posttranslational modification of amino acids extends the range of functions of the protein by attaching it to other biochemical functional groups (such as acetate, phosphate, various lipids and carbohydrates), changing the chemical nature of an amino acid (e.g. citrullination), or making structural changes (e.g. formation of disulfide bridges).
Also, enzymes may remove amino acids from the amino end of the protein, or cut the peptide chain in the middle. For instance, the peptide hormone insulin is cut twice after disulfide bonds are formed, and a propeptide is removed from the middle of the chain; the resulting protein consists of two polypeptide chains connected by disulfide bonds. Also, most nascent polypeptides start with the amino acid methionine because the "start" codon on mRNA also codes for this amino acid. This amino acid is usually taken off during post-translational modification.
Other modifications, like phosphorylation, are part of common mechanisms for controlling the behavior of a protein, for instance activating or inactivating an enzyme.
Post-translational modification of proteins can be detected by a variety of techniques, including mass spectrometry,  Eastern blotting, and Western blotting.

[[Night fighter]]
CATEGORIES: Fighter aircraft

A night fighter (also known as all-weather fighter or all-weather interceptor for a period of time post-World War IIWinchester 2006, p. 184.) is a fighter aircraft adapted for use at night or in other times of bad visibility. Night fighters began to be used in World War I and included types that were specifically modified to operate at night.
During World War II, night fighters were either purpose-built or day fighters modified to be effective night fighting combat aircraft, often employing radar or other systems for providing some sort of detection capability in low visibility. Many WW II night fighters also included Instrument landing systems for landing at night as turning on the runway lights made runways into an easy target for opposing intruders.
Avionics systems were greatly miniaturized over time allowing the addition of radar altimeter, Terrain-following radar, improved Instrument landing system (ILS), Microwave landing system (MLS), Doppler Weather radar, LORAN receivers, GEE, Tactical air navigation system (TACAN), Inertial navigation system (INS), GPS, GNSS in aircraft. The addition of greatly improved landing and navigation equipment combined with radar led to the use of the term all-weather fighter or all-weather fighter attack, depending on the aircraft capabilities. The use of the term night fighter gradually faded away as a result of these improvements.

Winter vomiting bug is a common term for noroviruses in the UK, because the virus tends to cause vomiting and to spread more easily in winter, when people tend to spend more time indoors and near to each other.
After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary with one publication drawing the conclusion that protective immunity to the same strain of norovirus lasts for six months, but that all such immunity is gone after two years.  
Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories,  and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person.
Norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents, as it does not have a lipid envelope.
The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus, the only species of the genus. The species causes approximately 90% of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world, and may be responsible for 50% of all foodborne outbreaks  of gastroenteritis  in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htm |title=Norovirus: Technical Fact Sheet |publisher=National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC[/tpl]

[[Norwalk virus]]

CATEGORIES: Foodborne illnesses, Norovirus, Vomiting

Norwalk virus is known as winter vomiting virus, which was originally named after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute viral gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968.
Viruses are  classified into family, genus, and species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), and Norwalk virus is the only species of the genus Norovirus, which belongs to the family Caliciviridae. Formerly, Norwalk virus was included in the genus "Norwalk-like virus" between 1999 and 2002, and the "Norwalk-like virus" was replaced with Norovirus on the 8th Report of the ICTV in response to the approval of the new name of Norovirus at the 12th International Congress of Virology in Paris (2002). Because the genus Norovirus has only one species (Norwalk virus) as well as the fact the genus "Norwalk-like virus" was officially replaced with the genus Norovirus, these often cause confusion on the correct usage of the term Norovirus and that of Norwalk virus. Currently, the term norovirus has been more frequently used in the media and by health authorities.      
In association with the circumstances,[tpl]vague|date=January 2013[/tpl] the ICTV received a request to rename the genus Norovirus in earlier 2011 because children in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name "Noro" may have the possibility of teasing or bullying from others. The ICTV circulated the concerns to many international virologists, including those who originally proposed the taxonomic name, and the concerns were extensively discussed. A press release[ref]

[tpl]vs|need more bibliographic info|date=February 2013[/tpl][/ref] and a newsletter were finally published by the ICTV in 2011, which strongly encourage the media, national health authorities and the scientific community to use the virus name "Norwalk virus", rather than the term "norovirus," when referring to outbreaks of the disease. The ICTV regards the usage of the term "norovirus" as incorrect when referring to outbreaks actually due to Norwalk virus because there is no virus species called norovirus.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

[[Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy]]

CATEGORIES: 1618 births, 1693 deaths, French memoirists, Members of the Académie française, 17th-century French writers

Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy (13 April 1618 – 9 April 1693), commonly known as Bussy-Rabutin, was a French memoirist. He was the cousin and frequent correspondent of Madame de Sévigné.
Born at Epiry, near Autun, he represented a family of distinction in Burgundy, and his father, Léonor de Rabutin, was lieutenant general of the province of Nivernais.
Roger was the third son, but by the death of his elder brothers became the representative of the family. He  studied first at the Jesuit school in Autun, and then at the College de Clermont. He left to enter the army when he was only sixteen and fought in several campaigns, succeeding his father in the office of mestre de camp. He participated in the 1634 siege of La Mothe-en-Bassigny in Lorraine under the direction of maréchal de La Force. He himself tells us that his two ambitions were to become "honnête homme" and to distinguish himself in arms, but luck was against him. In 1641 he was sent to the Bastille by Richelieu for some months as a punishment for neglect of his duties in his pursuit of gallantry.
In 1643 he married a cousin, Gabrielle de Toulongeon, and for a short time he left the army. But in 1645 he succeeded to his father's position in the Nivernais, and served under Condé in Catalonia. His wife died in 1646, and he became more notorious than ever through an attempt to abduct Madame de Miramion, a rich widow. This affair was settled with some difficulty by a considerable payment on Bussy's part, and he afterwards married Louise de Rouville.
When Condé joined the party of the Fronde Bussy joined him, but a fancied slight on the part of the prince finally decided him for the royal side. He fought with some distinction both in the civil war and on foreign service and, buying the commission of mestre de camp in 1655, he went on to serve under Turenne in Flanders. He served there in several campaigns and distinguished himself at the Battle of the Dunes (1658) and elsewhere; but he did not get on well with his general, and his quarrelsome disposition, his overweening vanity and his habit of composing libellous chansons made him eventually the enemy of most persons of position both in the army and at court.
In the year 1659 he fell into disgrace for having taken part in an orgy at Roissy near Paris during Holy Week, which caused great scandal. Bussy was ordered to retire to his estates at Château de Bussy-Rabutin, and beguiled his enforced leisure by composing his famous Histoire amoureuse des Gaules (written in 1660) for the amusement of his sick mistress, Madame de Montglas. This book, a series of portraits and accounts of the intrigues of the chief ladies of the court, witty enough, but still more ill-natured, circulated freely in manuscript and had numerous spurious sequels. Although Bussy denied the charges (blaming Madame de la Baume), it was said that he had not spared the reputations of members of the royal family, including Madame and the Queen Mother. In a letter of apology and explanation to the king Bussy claimed that a false friend who had asked to borrow it briefly (Madame de la Baume) had copied it and altered it without his knowledge. The king, angry at the report, was momentarily appeased when Bussy showed him the original manuscript to disprove the scandal, but a closed-door meeting (most likely with Madame de la Baume) sealed Bussy's fate.
He was sent to the Bastille on 17 April 1665, where he remained for more than a year, and he was only liberated on condition of retiring to his estates, where he lived in exile for seventeen years. Bussy felt the disgrace keenly, but the enforced close of his military career was still more bitter. In 1682 he was allowed to revisit the court, but the coldness of his reception there made his provincial exile seem preferable and he returned to Burgundy, where he died.
He had been elected to the Académie française in 1665, and held his chair there until his death in 1693.
The Histoire amoureuse is adapted from Petronius in its most striking passages, and its attractions include its famously critical portraits of Madame de Sévigné and the Prince de Condé and its unique style. His Mémoires, published after his death, are likewise lively and characteristic and have all the charm of a historical romance of the adventurous type. His voluminous correspondence yields to few collections of the kind in variety and interest, except to that of Madame de Sévigné, who is indeed represented in it to a great extent, and whose letters first appeared in it. The literary and historical student, therefore, owes Bussy some thanks.
Bussy wrote other things, of which the most important, his Genealogy of the Rabutin Family, remained in manuscript till 1867, while his Considerations sur la guerre was first published in Dresden in 1746. He also wrote a series of biographies for the use of his children, in which his own life serves a moral purpose.

The first member of the A320 family—the A320—was launched in March 1984, first flew on 22 February 1987, and was first delivered in 1988. The family was soon extended to include the A321 (first delivered 1994), the A319 (1996), and the A318 (2003). The A320 family pioneered the use of digital fly-by-wire flight control systems, as well as side-stick controls, in commercial aircraft. There has been a continuous improvement process since introduction.
In December 2010, Airbus officially launched the new generation of the A320 family with the A320neo "New Engine Option".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-offers-new-fuel-saving-engine-options-for-a320-family/ |title=Airbus offers new fuel saving engine options for A320 Family |publisher=Airbus |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2011[/tpl]  The new generation offers a choice of the CFM International LEAP-X or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G, combined with airframe improvements and the addition of winglets, named Sharklets by Airbus.  The aircraft will deliver fuel savings of up to 15%. Virgin America will be the launch customer for the aircraft in spring of 2016. As of December 2011, a total of 1,196 A320neo family aircraft have been ordered by 21 airlines, making it the fastest ever selling commercial aircraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/airbus-wins-211-orders-and-commitments-worth-us205-billion/ |title=Airbus wins 211 orders and commitments worth US$20.5 billion |publisher=Airbus |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=31 December 2011[/tpl]
