CATEGORIES: 1901 births, 1985 deaths, People from Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, American communists

H.H. Lewis (1901–1985) was a Communist American poet during the 1930s thru the 1970s.
Harold Harwell Lewis, or H.H. Lewis as he become known, was born January 13, 1901, near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He was one of four children born to Thomas and Catherine Tisdale Lewis.Special Collections and Archives, Southeast Missouri State University, H.H. Lewis Finding Aid, Descriptive Overview.  http://library.semo.edu/archives/collections/Finding%20Aids/Lewis,%20H.H/CSS/H.%20H.%20Lewis%20Descriptive%20Overview.htm
He received his secondary education at the Southeast Missouri State Normal School--Third District Training School, which is now named Southeast Missouri State University.  During the Great Depression, Lewis traveled as a common laborer in the Southwest. Away from his parents for the first time, Lewis was incredibly poor and many of his encounters and experiences traveling would fuel his future career.
 That "stove-devil," heat-blanched and heat-crazed, gaunt and flagrantly dirty, up against it for twelve hours daily, received $60 per month. The waiters got $1.25 per day. The restaurant belonged to a chain of such for dime-gripping bums and low-paid working-stiffs. Came gringos and greasers for coffee and stew, hash, beans—a large bowl of brown beans for a dime. Came Negroes, humblest of all. Came "mouthmen" and "wolves," proletarian beasts of the ghastliest ilk. From the poverty of America, in this bottomless hell, came these contorted and condemned souls.  — H.H. Lewis on his slide into poverty. Found in The Anvil, 1933Wixson, Douglas C.

He eventually returned to the family farm to pursue a career of freelance writing, including publishing his own magazine, The Outlander.Special Collections and Archives, Southeast Missouri State University, H.H. Lewis Finding Aid, Descriptive Overview.  http://library.semo.edu/archives/collections/Finding%20Aids/Lewis,%20H.H/H.%20H.%20Lewis%20Finding%20Aid.htm  For a brief period in the 1930s Lewis enjoyed a small measure of acclaim. Malcolm Cowley in The New Republic in 1932 called him "the red-starred laureate, the Joe Hill of the Communist Movement." An editor of Partisan Review, in a testy exchange with Lewis, called him "a necrophilic son of a cretin." He was heralded as a rising star of proletarian literature by V. F. Calverton and editors of the Soviet publication, International Literature, Lewis seemed destined to stir up controversy.[ref]Wixson, Douglas C. In Search of the Low-Down Americano: H. H.

http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/william_carlos_williams_review/v026/26.1wixson.html[/ref]
H.H. Lewis had a close friendship with famous writer William Carlos Williams, to whom Lewis represented a fresh and vigorous voice in the search for the "low-down Americano," or common man.  With such support, both magazines began to published Lewis's prose and poetry in the 1930s, including Mencken's The American Mercury, Jack Conroy's The Anvil, The New Republic, and numerous others. In 1937, Lewis's poetry won the prestigious Harriet Monroe Literary Prize.Special Collections and Archives, Southeast Missouri State University, H.H.

The Missouri farmhand poet and Communist essayist wrote both poetry and prose on the condition of Native Americans, African-American, and sharecroppers that were unique at the time of his creating them. Lewis tried to embrace the voice of the people, writing in the vernacular as well as writing in a style commonly referred to as Grammar B. His writings were translated into Japanese, French, German, and Russian and he was widely praised and popular in the Soviet Union for his proletarian and revolutionary sympathies.
After several unsuccessful attempts to secure a Guggenheim Fellowship to support research on sharecroppers, Lewis devoted the rest of his life to exposing subversive threats to his country at home and abroad.Special Collections and Archives, Southeast Missouri State University, H.H. Lewis Finding Aid, Descriptive Overview.  http://library.semo.edu/archives/collections/Finding%20Aids/Lewis,%20H.H/H.%20H.%20Lewis%20Finding%20Aid.htm His poetry and essays often focus on the plight of the sharecropper or on his various conspiracy theories.  He was interested particularly in conspiracies relating to the attack on Pearl Harbor and the role played by the Communist Party and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He recorded the story of his life in an autobiographical story “Down the Skidway.Special Collections and Archives, Southeast Missouri State University, H.H.

Ad diem Illum Laetissimum is an encyclical of Pope Pius X  on the Immaculate Conception, Given at Rome in St. Peter's on the second day of February, 1904, in the first year of his Pontificate. It is issued in commemoration of the fiftieth  anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate conception. It is an important document, because it explains the Mariology of Saint Pope Pius X.Mark Miravalle, 1993, Introduction to Mary, Queenship Publishing ISBN 978-1-882972-06-7, page 164
The first reason, why Pope Pius writes the encyclical, is his desire in the restoration of all things in Christ,  which he had defined as his motto in his  first Encyclical letter. To Pope Pius, there is no safer or more direct road than  Mary. She is  uniting all mankind in Christ.Ad diem illum 5
The encyclical relied heavily on the views expressed in Saint Louis de Montfort's book True Devotion to Mary. In fact the language of both writings is strikingly similar, which is not surprising, since Saint Pius highly esteemed True Devotion and granted an Apostolic Blessing to all who read it.Pope Pius X website

The Bainuk people (also called Banyuk, Banun, Banyun, Bainouk, Bainunk, Banyum, Bagnoun, Banhum, Banyung, Ñuñ, Elomay, or Elunay) are an ethnic group that today lives primarily in Senegal as well as in parts of Gambia and Guinea-Bissau.  The Bainuk are believed to have been the first inhabitants of the lower Casamance. The name Banyun is attributed to the Portuguese, who derived the word from Mandinka and applied it as a collective name for a number of groups settled at strategic sites along waterways, portages, and trade paths between the Gambia and Cacheu rivers.... Possibly Banyun served as a generic term for "trader," much as dyula identifies Mande traders engaged in long-distance commerce (Map 9).George E. Brooks, Landlords and strangers: Ecology, society, and trade in Western Africa, 1000-1630 (Westview Press, 1993; ISBN 0813312620), p. 87. 
In the fifteenth century, there were at least five Bainuk states including Bichangor, Jase, Foni and Buguando.  The Bainuk were also a major component of the population of Kasa.
In modern times the Bambe have often become absorbed into the Mande or Jola cultures.

In the 1976 Olympics the following summer, he could manage only a silver medal in the 400 m freestyle; he was completely shut out of his signature event, the 1500 m freestyle. He could not compete four years later when the US led the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott in Moscow, Russia. Shaw further was a member of the 1984 US water polo team that was undefeated in Olympic competition but was awarded the silver medal because the Yugoslav team, with an identical record, scored four more goals overall. 
Between 1974 and 1984, Shaw won 2 Olympic silver medals; 3 World Championships; 7 National U.S. Amateur Athletic Union titles; and 3 U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association Championships.

The 2002 Oregon gubernatorial election took place on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic Governor of Oregon John Kitzhaber was unable to seek a third consecutive term as Governor, therefore creating an open seat. To replace him, former Oregon Supreme Court Associate Justice Ted Kulongoski won a crowded and competitive Democratic primary, while former State Representative Kevin Mannix emerged from an equally competitive Republican primary. The campaign between Kulongoski and Mannix, who were joined by Libertarian nominee Tom Cox, was close and went down to the wire. Ultimately, Kulongoski eked out a narrow margin of victory over Mannix, which was slightly smaller than Cox's total vote share, allowing Kulongoski to win what would be the first of two terms as Governor.

"Treehouse of Horror XIX" is the fourth episode of the twentieth season of The Simpsons. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 2, 2008. This is the nineteenth Treehouse of Horror episode, and, like the other "Treehouse of Horror" episodes, contains three self-contained segments: in "Untitled Robot Parody", Transformer robots run amok in Springfield; in "How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising", Homer is hired by ad agents to kill celebrities so their images can be used for free; and in a Simpsons-style parody of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (called "It's The Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse"), Milhouse summons a demon pumpkin who goes berserk when it sees humans carving its brethren into jack-o-lanterns as part of Halloween tradition. It was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Bob Anderson. 
A total of 12.48 million viewers tuned in to watch during its first airing, more than any other episode since "The Wife Aquatic". The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who generally regarded "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" as the best segment. Shortly after airing, the episode was criticized by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) because a character (Nelson Muntz) casually uses the adjective "gay" to insult The Grand Pumpkin.

The John B. Gough House, also known as Hillside, is a National Historic Landmark at 215 Main Street in Boylston, Massachusetts.  It is significant as the home of temperance orator John B. Gough, and as an excellent example of Italianate architecture.  Gough was born in England and came to the United States as a child.  After the death of his mother in 1835, his life descended into alcoholism, until he took a temperance pledge in 1842.  In 1846 he married Mary Whitcombe, a Boylston native, and in 1848 built this two story farmhouse, which is where he lived until his death in 1886.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=BOY.47|title=MACRIS inventory record for John B. Gough House|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-03-02[/tpl]
The house is roughly square in plan, with three bays on each side, and is topped by a flat roof with a square belvedere on top.  It has wide overhanging eaves studded with brackets, and a wide porch spans the width of the front. Additions have been added onto the rear of the house.
After Gough's death, the house was purchased by William J. Hogg, owner of the Worcester-based Crompton Carpet Company.  For much of the 20th century the estate served as the campus of the Shepherd Knapp School, and in the 1980s the property was acquired by Digital Equipment Corporation and used as a training facility.  It is now in under the control of the Boylston Historical Society, which is working to restore the property.
The house was declared a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.NHL Listing information

Lowell's Boat Shop (Hiram Lowell & Sons) is a National Historic Landmark at 459 Main Street in Amesbury, Massachusetts.
The shop was built in 1793 by Simeon Lowell. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.NHL Listing Information
Located on the banks of the Merrimack River, Lowell’s Boat Shop is considered to be the birthplace of the legendary New England fishing dory, originated by Simeon Lowell. His grandson, Hiram, further developed the dory into the simplified Banks dory design that became a mainstay of New England's fishing fleets.Gardner, John. The Dory Book, Mystic Seaport  An historian remarked, "A Lowell's dory to a fisherman was like a hammer to a carpenter". Hiram also created a seminal form of assembly line production that made Lowell's the world's preeminent dory manufacturer of its day. It is said to have greatly influenced Henry Ford's mass production processes.Winter Street Associates, 1996 Within the boat shop's buildings remain such interesting historic features as ancient ship's knees, heavily worn floorboards and two centuries of accumulated paint coat the floors. The oldest buildings remaining on the site are combined Greek Revival structures that were built in the 1860s.  A cross-beam features annual production figures, branded into the wood from 1897 through 1919, reveal that 2,029 boats were built here, by hand, in the single year of 1911.  Lowell’s Boat Shop is also a rare survivor of the many various industries for which the Merrimack River Valley region was known.  From George Washington to Barack Obama, LBS has remained in operation through every US presidency on property purchased by founder, Simeon Lowell, in the 18th century.
Today, Lowell's Boat Shop is a working boat shop and living museum.  The shop continues to build dories and skiffs in the tradition of the seven generations of the Lowell family.  Its rich history is conveyed through boat building classes, model dory classes, apprenticeships, onsite programs for scouts, local schools and at-risk youth.  Because the cost of building wooden boats provides little profit margin, Lowell's Maritime Foundation continues to find creative ways to augment income. Volunteers, mentored by the boat builders, manage the onsite production of a variety of wood based products that are made from wood that might otherwise be considered scrap. Lowell's Boat Shop actively encourages boat building, tourism and maritime fine arts with affiliations with a variety of government agencies and non-profit organizations. During the boating season, members are able to row Lowell's line of dories and skiffs as a part of the Members Open Waterfront Program. The Boat Shop is fully accessible to the handicapped and guided tours are offered by appointment.
In 2012, Lowell's Boat Shop was chosen to participate in an historic project for America's last extant whale ship, the Charles Charles W. Morgan. A group of local high school apprentices have assisted in the construction of an historically accurate Beetle-design whaleboat replica, which will accompany the Charles W. Morgan when her restoration is complete.

Gordon R. Sherven (born August 21, 1963 in Weyburn, Saskatchewan and raised in Mankota, Saskatchewan) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played in many games for the Canada national men's ice hockey team.
Sherven was selected by the Edmonton Oilers in the tenth round of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He played three seasons of collegiate hockey for the University of North Dakota from 1981–84, including the championship team of the 1982 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament. He also played for the Canada national junior hockey team that won the bronze medal at the 1983 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and the senior national team that won the bronze medal at the 1983 World Ice Hockey Championships only four months later. Only on two other occasions have Canadian players played for both the junior team and the senior team in the same year.[tpl]cite web |title=The meteoric rise of Jonathan Toews |author=Andrew Podnieks |date=2005-04-29 |publisher=IIHF |work=IHWC.net 2005 |url=http://admin19.ihwc.net/english/article/news/index.ihwc?artId=2535 |accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]
Sherven made his National Hockey League debut in the 1983–84 season, playing in only two games with the Oilers and scoring one goal. He played in 37 games with the club the following season, and also played 5 games with the minor league affiliate Nova Scotia Oilers. He was traded to the Minnesota North Stars mid-season, and played in 32 regular season games and 3 playoff games for the North Stars. In 1985–86, he was traded back to the Oilers, but spent most of that season in Nova Scotia. He was claimed by the Hartford Whalers before the 1986–87 season, but only played 7 games with the team that season, and a single game in the following season.
Sherven played for the Canadian national team for most of the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons. At the time, professionals were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games, but full-time NHL players were not released from their club teams to play for their national teams. Therefore, the Canadian national team typically included top NHL prospects and veteran pros with NHL experience, and they played full seasons together all over the world against both national and club teams in preparation for the Games. Sherven was a member of the Canadian team that finished fourth in ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics, held in Calgary.
Sherven moved to Germany for the 1988–89 season, and spent the next twelve years playing for several teams in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga, including the Star Bulls Rosenheim and Düsseldorfer EG. He retired at the end of the 1999–2000 season.

Later, following the birth of Gyalwang Je Kunga Paljor (1428–1476) considered to be the first of his re-incarnations, Tsangpa Gyare was held to be the first of a succession of Gyalwang Drukpa or Drukchen incarnations who, at the time of the fifth Gyalwang Drukpa Pagsam Wangpo (1593—1653), became established as the reincarnate leaders of the Drukpa lineage in Tibet.

[[Climate of Ecuador]]
CATEGORIES: Geography of Ecuador, Climate by country

The climate of Ecuador varies by region, due to differences in altitude and proximity to the equator.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.languagecrossing.com/Destinations/Ecuador/Climate_of_Ecuador/|title=Climate of Ecuador[/tpl]
The coastal lowlands to the west of Ecuador are typically warm with temperatures in the region of [tpl]convert|25|°C|lk=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.piedrablanca.org/climate.htm|title=Climate in Ecuador[/tpl] Coastal areas are affected by ocean currents and between January and April are hot and rainy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hacienda-ecuador.com/Ecuador/Ecuador_4.html|title=Ecuador:Climate[/tpl]
The weather in Quito is consistent to that of a subtropical highland climate. The city has a fairly constant cool climate due to its elevation and proximity to the equator. The average temperature during the day is [tpl]convert|66|F|1[/tpl], which generally falls to an average of [tpl]convert|50|F[/tpl] at night. The average temperature annually is [tpl]convert|64|F|1[/tpl] There are only really two obvious seasons in the city: dry and wet. The dry season (summer) runs from June to September and the wet season (winter) is from October to May.  As Ecuador is in the southern hemisphere, June to Sept. is winter, and winter is generally the dry season in warm climates. spring, winter, and fall are generally the "wet seasons" while summer is the dry {with exception of the first month of fall being dry.}
Ecuador lies directly on the equator, so the entire country enjoys 12 hours of direct equatorial daylight 365 days a year. However, the climate you will experience depends largely on where you are in Ecuador, since there are four distinct geographical areas—the Sierra (mountains), the Oriente (eastern rainforests), the La Costa (Pacific coastal plains), and the Galapagos Islands.
For example, Ecuador’s capital, Quito, lies in the Central Valley between the Andean Mountains’ eastern and western ridges. The equator is less than 20 miles north of the city, yet at an altitude of 9,350 feet (2,900 meters), Quito’s climate is spring-like year around: about 50° F (10° C) at night and as high as 76° F (25° C) during the day. The sun makes the difference. You can comfortably stroll out on a glorious Quito afternoon in shorts and a T-shirt, but you’ll need to take your wool sweater in case the clouds roll in. The equatorial sun is intense, but when it’s obscured by clouds, you realize how high in the Andes you really are. In fact, cold weather gear is needed for high altitude hiking and mountain climbing.
The beaches and rainforests, on the other hand, enjoy the tropical temperatures that one would expect from equatorial lowlands, with highs ranging between 80º F and 90º F. Between these two extremes, just about any type of weather can be found in Ecuador.

John Dewey Adkins (May 11, 1918 – December 26, 1998) was a Major League Baseball pitcher for the Washington Senators and Chicago Cubs in the 1940s. In a three season career, Adkins won two games, lost four, and had an earned run average (ERA) of 5.64.
Born in Norcatur, Kansas, he made his major league debut on September 19, 1942 as a late-season call-up for the Senators, starting the only game he appeared in that season. He allowed 8 runs (7 earned) in 6[tpl]fraction|1|3[/tpl] innings but did not figure in the decision. Adkins made a few more appearances for Washington the next season, all in relief, compiling a 2.61 ERA in seven games.
After eventually finding himself playing for Atlanta in the independent minor league Southern Association, Dewey did not make another appearance at the big league level until the age of 31. Reemerging with the Chicago Cubs in 1949, Adkins saw his most extensive major league action. He pitched in thirty games as both a starter and a reliever, completing one of his five starts and finishing fourteen of the 25 games in which he appeared as a reliever. Adkins also hit his only major league home run as a member of the 1949 Cubs. His 1949 record of 2–4 and ERA of 5.68 failed to get him a job the next season, and he never again appeared at the major league level.
Adkins died on December 26, 1998 in Santa Monica, California.

American Independent Writers (AIW) was an American trade organization for professional writers. It existed from 1975 until about 2011, when, due to dwindling membership and financial problems, it went out of business. 
It was formed as the Washington Independent Writers (WIW) in 1975 by a group of freelance writers in the Washington DC area to address concerns over finding health insurance, job searching, and to provide social opportunities to help writers overcome isolation. Its first meetings were held in the National Press Club."History of AIW" American Independent Writers official site. Retrieved 2011-11-28.
The first meeting, in April 1975, was attended by 200 people. By 1987, WIW was the largest regional writers' group in the country."Writers Say Tax Changes Ruining Incomes", by David Vesey, UPI, The Durant Daily Democrat, August 5, 1987. Online at Google News. Also as "New Taxhttp://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en&tab=wn Rules May Put Writers Out of Business", Schenectady Gazette, August 7, 1987. In 2004, it had 1500 members.
Originally WIW provided services including "a monthly newsletter, Job Bank, social activities, directory of members, legal services program, health insurance access, grievance procedures, medical insurance, and a continuing round of workshops and seminars." By the 1980s, these had expanded to include political activism, and legal support and fundraising, most famously for founding member Kitty Kelley from 1983 to 1984, when she was sued by Frank Sinatra in an attempt to stop her publication of his unauthorized biography, His Way."Writer Gets Notice of Sinatra Suit", Associated Press, The Free Lance–Star, Nov 7, 1983, page 9.

[[Ecological study]]
CATEGORIES: Epidemiology, Design of experiments

Ecological studies are studies of risk-modifying factors on health or other outcomes based on populations defined either geographically or temporally. Both risk-modifying factors and outcomes are averaged for the populations in each geographical or temporal unit and then compared using standard statistical methods.
Ecological studies have often found links between risk-modifying factors and health outcomes well in advance of other epidemiological or laboratory approaches. Several examples are given here.
The study by John Snow regarding a cholera outbreak in London is considered the first ecological study to solve a health issue. He used a map of deaths from cholera to determine that the source of the cholera was a pump on Broad Street. He had the pump handle removed in 1854 and people stopped dying there 2006. It was only when Robert Koch discovered bacteria years later that the mechanism of cholera transmission was understood.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kaufmann SH|coauthors=Schaible UE|title=100th anniversary of Robert Koch's Nobel Prize for the discovery of the tubercle bacillus|journal=Trends Microbiol |year=2005|volume=13|issue=10|pages=469–75|pmid=16112578[/tpl]
Dietary risk factors for cancer have also been studied using both geographical and temporal ecological studies. Multi-country ecological studies of cancer incidence and mortality rates with respect to national diets have shown that some dietary factors such as animal products (meat, milk, fish and eggs), added sweeteners/sugar, and some fats appear to be risk factors for many types of cancer, while cereals/grains and vegetable products as a whole appear to be risk reduction factors for many types of cancer.[tpl]cite journal|last=Armstrong B|coauthors=Doll R|title=Environmental factors and cancer incidence and mortality in different countries, with special reference to dietary practices|journal=Int J Cancer|year=1975|volume=15|issue=4|pages=617–31|pmid=1182356[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Grant WB|title=A multicountry ecological study of cancer incidence rates in 2008 with respect to various risk-modifying factors|journal=Nutrients|year=2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=163–189|pmid=24379012|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072[/tpl] Temporal changes in Japan in the types of cancer common in Western developed countries have been linked to the nutrition transition to the Western diet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tominaga S|coauthors=Kuroishi T|title=An ecological study on diet/nutrition and cancer in Japan|journal=Int J Cancer|year=1997|issue=Suppl 10|pages=2–6|pmid=9209011[/tpl]
An important advancement in the understanding of risk-modifying factors for cancer was made by examining maps of cancer mortality rates. The map of colon cancer mortality rates in the United States was used by the brothers Cedric and Frank C. Garland to propose the hypothesis that solar ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, through vitamin D production, reduced the risk of cancer (the UVB-vitamin D-cancer hypothesis).[tpl]cite journal|last=Garland CF|coauthors=Garland FC|title=Do sunlight and vitamin D reduce the likelihood of colon cancer?|journal=Int J Epidemiol|year=1980|volume=9|issue=3|pages=227–31|pmid=7440046[/tpl] Since then many ecological studies have been performed relating the reduction of incidence or mortality rates of over 20 types of cancer to lower solar UVB doses.[tpl]cite journal|last=Moukayed M|coauthors=Grant WB|title=Molecular link between vitamin D and cancer prevention|journal=Nutrients|year=2013|volume=5|issue=10|pages=3993–4023|pmid=24084056[/tpl]
Links between diet and Alzheimer’s disease have been studied using both geographical and temporal ecological studies. The first paper linking diet to risk of Alzheimer’s disease was a multicountry ecological study published in 1997.[tpl]cite journal|last=Grant WB|title=Dietary Links to Alzheimer’s Disease|journal=Alzheimer’s Disease Review|year=1997|volume=2|pages=42–57|url=http://www.sunarc.org/JAD97.pdf[/tpl] It used prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in 11 countries along with dietary supply factors, finding that total fat and total energy (caloric) supply were strongly correlated with prevalence, while fish and cereals/grains were inversely correlated (i.e., protective). Diet is now considered an important risk-modifying factor for Alzheimer’s disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Devanand D|coauthors=Lee J, Luchsinger J, Manly J, Marder K, Mayeux R, Scarmeas N, Schupf N, Stern Y|title=Lessons from epidemiologic research about risk factors, modifiers, and progression of late onset Alzheimer's Disease in New York City at Columbia University Medical Center|journal=J Alzheimers Dis|year=2013|volume=33|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S447-55|pmid=22836187[/tpl] Recently it was reported that the rapid risk of Alzheimer’s disease in Japan between 1985 and 2007 was likely due to the nutrition transition from the traditional Japanese diet to the Western diet.[tpl]cite journal|last=Grant WB|title=Trends in diet and Alzheimer’s disease during the nutrition transition in Japan and developing countries|journal=J Alz Dis|year=2014|volume=38|issue=3|pages=611–20|pmid=24037034[/tpl]
Another example of the use of temporal ecological studies relates to influenza. John Cannell and associates hypothesized that the seasonality of influenza was largely driven by seasonal variations in solar UVB doses and calcidiol levels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cannell JJ|coauthors=Vieth R, Umhau JC, Holick MF, Grant WB, Madronich S, Garland CF, Giovannucci E|title=Epidemic influenza and vitamin D|journal=Epidemiol Infect|year=2006|volume=134|issue=6|pages=1129–40|pmid=16959053[/tpl] A randomized controlled trial involving Japanese school children found that taking 1000 IU per day vitamin D3 reduced the risk of type A influenza by two-thirds.[tpl]cite journal|last=Urashima M|coauthors=Segawa T, Okazaki M, Kurihara M, Wada Y, Ida H|title=Randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation to prevent seasonal influenza A in schoolchildren|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|year=2010|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1255–60|pmid=20219962[/tpl]
Ecological studies are particularly useful for generating hypotheses since they can use existing data sets and rapidly test the hypothesis. The advantages of the ecological studies include the large number of people that can be included in the study and the large number of risk-modifying factors that can be examined.
The term “ecological fallacy” means that the findings for the groups may not apply to individuals in the group. However, this term also applies to observational studies and randomized controlled trials. All epidemiological studies include some people who have health outcomes related to the risk-modifying factors studied and some who do not. For example, genetic differences affect how people respond to pharmaceutical drugs. Thus, concern about the ecological fallacy should not be used to disparage ecological studies. The more important consideration is that ecological studies should include as many known risk-modifying factors for any outcome as possible, adding others if warranted. Then the results should be evaluated by other methods, using, for example, Hill’s criteria for causality in a biological system.

Kvaerner Govan Ltd (KGL), located at Govan in Glasgow on the River Clyde, was a shipyard subsidiary formed in 1988 when the Norwegian group Kvaerner Industrier purchased the Govan Shipbuilders division of the nationalised British Shipbuilders corporation. Prior to the Govan Shipyard's nationalisation in 1977, as a result of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act, it had been operated by Govan Shipbuilders Ltd, which emerged from the collapse of the previous Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) joint venture in 1972. Prior to the formation of UCS in 1968, the Shipyard was operated by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, which had a history extending back to 1834.
Kvaerner Govan Ltd invested £30m in modernisation of the shipyard during the early 1990s to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers. This included the construction of a large Tank Assembly Shop (TAS), later known as the Ship Block Outfit Hall (SBOH), which enabled the indoor construction of large prefabricated modular ship blocks. Other investment included renovating one of the yard's three slipways to incorporate a 'skidding' system, with another filled in to create more berthside storage area. The new indoor modular block construction techniques cut the time ships spent on the outdoor slipways to 20 weeks from 18 months, which, along with reforms in labour relations, improved productivity at the yard by 40% between 1988 and 1992.Today - UK: A fitful pride on the Clyde - GOVAN SHIPBUILDERS
Between 1991 and 2000, Kvaerner Govan constructed 19 vessels in the yard, including 4 gas tankers and 6 chemical tankers. However, in the later 1990s, the market for such vessels was depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts. This included five small Anchor handling tug supply vessels for the North Sea oil industry. 
The yard also constructed the helicopter carrier [tpl]HMS|Ocean|L12|6[/tpl] for the Royal Navy under sub-contract from VSEL, MS Norsea for North Sea Ferries and the highly sophisticated satellite launch command ship Sea Launch Commander for Sea Launch Inc of Long Beach, California.
In December 1999, after Kvaerner announced a withdrawal from the shipbuilding industry, the Govan yard was purchased by Clydeport and then taken on a long-term 20-year lease by BAE Systems Marine, who also owned the former Yarrow Shipbuilders yard in Scotstoun on the Clyde. It is now part of BAE Systems Surface Ships. Continued investment in capital equipment such as Plasma cutting and Panel Line welding, has seen the Govan Shipyard emerge as BAE Systems' Steelwork Centre of Excellence. The 220 ton capacity Fairfield Titan Crane, built in 1911, was demolished in 2007 to make way for construction of modules for the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers at the yard.

CATEGORIES: Swords of the United States, Ceremonial weapons

The West Point Cadets' Sword is issued to cadet officers of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York for use during their formal functions parades, inspections and graduation. It is also used during drills. The swords are issued on their appointment and returned to the Cadet Store after graduation.
The Ames model 1850 seems to be the grandparent of this type of Academy sword. The Academy added trademarks to their sword starting in 1872. Other academies customized their swords, but now only 2 remain. The West Point trademarked Cadet Sword is sold only to current cadets and alumni are the only authorized buyers. The basic cadet sword might not be made from the same materials specified by the Academy and is sold without trademarks. It can be purchased almost anywhere. The basic cadet sword has been or is made in Germany, West Germany, India, Spain and China, but not all swords are of the same quality. This sword is similar to those used at The Citadel and other military academies worldwide.
The major differences between the two can be seen at left for the U.S.M.A. blade and at right for the standard Academy sword. The blade etching can be seen in a photo below.

CATEGORIES: Dave Edmunds albums, Arista Records albums, Columbia Records albums, 1982 albums

[tpl]Refimprove|date=May 2008[/tpl]

D.E. 7th is a 1982 album by Welsh rock musician Dave Edmunds. The album was Edmunds' first project for Arista Records (in the UK) and Columbia Records (in the US), following a five-year stay with the Swan Song label.
Besides the label switches, D.E. 7th marked another big change for Edmunds; his band Rockpile had broken up the previous year, forcing him to assemble a whole new group of musicians for the album. The new band coalesced around guitarist Mickey Gee and bassist John David (both of whom had played with Edmunds in Love Sculpture), veteran pub rock pianist Geraint Watkins, and drummer Dave Charles. This group would record and tour with Edmunds throughout the rest of the 1980s.
D.E. 7th would reach #60 on the UK album charts and #46 on the Billboard 200, becoming his highest-charting solo album ever in the United States. The album's sales were helped by the inclusion of a previously unreleased Bruce Springsteen song, "From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)" (Springsteen's version, an outtake from his 1980 album The River, would remain unreleased until 2003). In his 2005 book The Ties That Bind, author Gary Graff explains:
When (Edmunds) went to see Springsteen perform at Wembley Arena (in 1981), he expected a good show but not necessarily a new song to record. "I was backstage in the hospitality area after the gig," Edmunds remembered, "and one of his crew of road managers tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Bruce wants to meet you.' I went back and had this great talk with him, and he played me this song and said, 'I'd like you to do this, if you like it.' He said he'd send me the tape, which he did."
Edmunds' recording of "From Small Things" reached #28 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and later appeared on his 2004 "best of" collection (also entitled From Small Things). One other D.E. 7th track was selected for that collection: a cover of Brian Hyland's 1962 top-30 hit "Warmed Over Kisses (Left Over Love)". Edmunds transformed the song, originally a countrypolitan waltz, into an uptempo bluegrass romp.

Xiao Zhao crater is small in comparison with many other craters on Mercury. However, Xiao Zhao's long bright rays make it a readily visible feature. The fresh, bright rays, which were created by material ejected outward during the impact event that formed the crater, indicate that Xiao Zhao is a relatively young crater on Mercury's surface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=184 |title=MESSENGER: MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging |publisher=Messenger.jhuapl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22[/tpl]

Viaggiatrice solitaria - Il meglio di Alice is a compilation album of recordings by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released by EMI Music in 1995.
Unlike EMI Italiana's 1994 best of package Il vento caldo dell'estate, which mainly included tracks from the artist's early career plus a disco remix of the 1982 duet "Chan-son Egocentrique" with Franco Battiato which surprisingly omitted all vocals by the composer himself, this compilation was produced with both the participation and approval of Alice. Viaggiatrice solitaria focuses on material from the albums Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi (1992), Il sole nella pioggia (1989) and Park Hotel (1986) - and it includes the original unremixed duet version of "Chan-son Egocentrique".
Viaggiatrice Solitaria (meaning "Solitary Traveller") became the final collaboration between the artist and the EMI Music label. Her first studio album for WEA/Warner Music, Charade, was released later that same year.

[[Mika Skyttä]]
CATEGORIES: 1973 births, People from Varkaus, Finnish ice hockey players, HPK players, Living people, Manchester Phoenix players, SaiPa players, Tappara players

Mika Skyttä (born April 25, 1973 in Varkaus, Finland is a retired Finnish professional ice hockey player. Skyttä began his career as a junior player with Tappara, one of the major Finnish ice hockey organisations.  He played in the Jr. A SM-Liiga, the highest standard of junior hockey in Finland and in his first season, helped Tappara into the post season with 7 points in 15 regular season games. His form would improve when the post-season arrived, and Skytta managed 10 points in 14 playoff games.
Despite this, Skyttä would move clubs and would begin to play regular hockey, again at junior level with Jokipojat, also in the A-Liiga. He would again show his point scoring prowess, totalling 39 points in just 36 games. It would be the same season that he would make his debut at senior standard, featuring in just one game at I Divisioona level. Skyttä would feature more prominently at senior level the season after, 1994/95 although Joensuu were now icing at II Divisioona level. Again Skyttä would prove his quality in the post season, helping Joensuu back to the division above with 21 points in 16 games.
This form ensured his place as a regular first team player for the 1995/96 season, and Skyttä would score 40 points in 44 regular season I Divisioona level.  His form was noticed by SaiPa, a team icing in the SM-liiga, the highest standard of hockey in Finland. Skyttä would start slowly for his new team, and despite icing in 50 games in the 1996/97 season scored just 3 points. Despite this he would be re-signed for the season after, and again would prove to be a regular player, icing in 43 games and helping SaiPa into the post-season.
Skyttä would be a popular player in Lappeenranta and would stay with SaiPa for a total of seven seasons. He would prove to be a reliable player, rarely missing games. Skyttä's consistency led to him becoming a firm favourite with the fans, and he would be an honest, if not spectacular point scorer. After his lengthy stay in Lappeenranta, Skyttä would move for the beginning of the 2003/04 season to play for HPK, also in the SM-Liiga. Skyttä would only stay for 18 games though before a mid-season move followed, this time to the Manchester Phoenix of the EIHL, where he would play alongside fellow Finn Petteri Lotila.
It would be Skyttä's first season playing hockey outside his native Finland, but despite this he flourished and managed to score 20 points in 37 regular season games, as well as 2 points in 6 play off contests. Unfortunately for Skyttä, the Manchester organisation temporarily suspended playing activity in the summer of 2004, due to ongoing financial difficulties stemming from the high costs encountered from hiring the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester.
Skyttä would hastily return home, and on arriving back in Finland would re-sign for SaiPa. He would go on to make over 100 appearances in his second spell over a two season period, scoring 24 points in that time. Skyttä would make an emotional departure from Kisapuisto at the end of the 2005/06 season though. He would play his final professional season with Herlev IC, a Danish team icing in the Danish Elitserien. He would sign off with one of his best seasons in terms of point production, and would finish with 25 points in 32 games before retiring from playing professional standard ice hockey.

[[Red and Black Attack]]
CATEGORIES: The Icarus Line albums

Red And Black Attack was the second release from the Hollywood-based rock band The Icarus Line. The EP was recorded and released very quickly after their debut 7-inch, Highlypuncturingnoisetestingyourabilitytohate on Hellcat Records. The EP was released on New American Dream. This was the band's first release to appear on CD, as well as New American Dream's debut release. The vinyl version was pressed by Slowgun Records on clear "wine" colored vinyl 7-inches.
New American Dream also released the band's split 7-inch picture disc with Ink & Dagger, and had actually originally signed Ink & Dagger to release their third, and final album on the label. However, after a car crash involving the label's owner and members of Ink & Dagger, who were on their way to visit The Icarus Line during a rehearsal, the label soon fell apart. The resulting fiasco was the prime reason The Icarus Line didn't record their debut album in 1999, as originally intended, and ended up signing instead with Crank! Records. Coincidentally, Ink & Dagger, who had also signed to the label for the release of their third and last album, ended up having Buddyhead release it instead. Other bands on the short-lived label included Discount (band) and Kind Of Like Spitting. The label's folding, resulted in this release being out of print for many years, and a highly sought after collectable. 
The EP was named as a reference to the band's visual style, which involved dressing in black with red neckties. This look was abandoned years later, after a number of other bands had started dressing similarly. Some of these bands went on to much greater mainstream success. So, as not to look like the "copycats" themselves, this attire was then "retired" by The Icarus Line. 
This release also coincided with yet another of the band's recurring problems of finding a suitable, and permanent drummer. This is why there is no drummer pictured on the cover of this release, something which confused people for quite some time. At the time of the EP's release, John Guerra (F-Minus, Black Fag) was filling the position. Soon after, the band recruited their fourth drummer, Mike Felix (Toys That Kill, Ex-Fork).
As an homage to their former band's drummer, Tim Childs, The Icarus Line included snippets he had recorded while playing drums at home, very briefly before his death. These were the last known recordings of Tim playing drums. The song "Separate The Sounds", was also quite obviously written about Tim, and his abrupt passing. These home recordings were spliced together during mastering by Blag Dahlia, the singer of The Dwarves.

[[Symphony No. 2 (Furtwängler)]]
CATEGORIES: 20th-century symphonies, Compositions by Wilhelm Furtwängler, Compositions in E minor, 1946 compositions

Symphony No. 2 in E minor was written by Wilhelm Furtwängler between 1945 and 1946. After quitting his conducting posts in Germany and Austria in protest at Nazi cultural policy, Furtwängler moved to Switzerland, where he wrote this symphony. It is in four movements:
The outer movements are in sonata form. The third movement, although not specifically referred to as such by Furtwängler, is a scherzo with trio. Unlike Bruckner, Furtwängler makes smooth transitions into and out of the trio.
Like Furtwängler's other symphonic works, the Symphony No. 2 is very rarely performed. Roughly 80 minutes in length, the work is heavily indebted to the late-Romantic style of composers like Anton Bruckner and Richard Wagner. As one commentator has observed, most of Furtwängler's works "are of Brucknerian length but, devoid of Brucknerian genius, few have the material to sustain such proportions."Christopher Fifield, "Relationships", The Musical Times, Vol. 131, No. 1770 (Aug., 1990), p. 426 
However, the symphony has strong advocates: Eugen Jochum recorded the work with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1954, there is another recording made by Daniel Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,Cowan (2002) Rob. July 5 "The Compact Collection: Birtwistle: 'The Woman and the Hare' and other works - The Nash Ensemble/ Martyn Brabbins; Furtwängler: Symphony No 2 - Chicago SO/Daniel Barenboim" The Independent On Sunday and Arthur Honegger wrote of this work, "The man who can write a score as rich as this is not to be argued about.  He is of the race of great musicians."Review by "RO" in Gramophone magazine, pp. 46, April 1995.
Furtwängler himself recorded his Symphony No. 2 in a studio with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1952,Mermelstein (1998) David. August 2 "Classical Briefs: SCHUMANN: SYMPHONY NO. 4; FURTWANGLER: SYMPHONY NO. 2" The New York Times and again with the Vienna Philharmonic, live, in 1953. The live recording was released on the Orfeo label.  A final and considerably reworked interpretation by Furtwangler exists with the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from March, 1954.

[[Colloquy with a Polish Aunt]]

CATEGORIES: Poetry by Wallace Stevens

"Colloquy with a Polish Aunt" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book
of poetry,  Harmonium. It
was first published in 1919.See Librivox

Revue des deux mondes (Journal of the Two Worlds) is a French language monthly literary and cultural affairs magazine that has been published in Paris since 1829. It was created in order to establish a cultural, economic and political bridge between France and the United States.http://www.revuedesdeuxmondes.fr/home/whoarewe.php#chrono The quotation says, "She knew all the legends of Paradise and all the stories about Poland." The phrase "from Voragine" seems to be a reference to Verazze.Jacobus de Voragine#cite note-0
Leading interpreters of Harmonium give Colloquy a wide
berth. Buttel omits it from his index catalog of the collection's
poems. Bates steers clear of it similarly. The poem is a contribution to one of Stevens's major themes,Vendler writes, "Some readers have seen his subject as an epistemological one, and have written about his views on the imagination and its uneasy rapport with reality. Others have seen his subject as a moral one, a justification of an aesthetic hedonism. Still others have seen his subject as a native humanist one, the quest of the American Adam for a Paradise in the wilderness." (3) the relationship between imagination and reality. The poet's imaginative dream transforms the common drudge into women swathed in indigo, etc.

[[Chicks Incorporated]]
CATEGORIES: Queensland musical groups

Chicks Incorporated were an Australian dance rock band formed in Brisbane in 1977. Their sound was largely derived from American soul, funk, pop, rock and disco.  Starting out as an almost all-girl band with guitarist Chris Mitchell being the only male member, they were led by the late drummer Miriam Curtis, who produced their sole album "Security" in 1980.  They attracted a lot of local attention due to their sexy appearance and wild dancing.  
The band's first single was "Jive To Stay Alive" released on RCA Records, and was also featured on a few disco compilation albums such as "Dats Disco" on RCA.  Most of the band's material was written by well-respected Brisbane songwriters Laurie Stone and Peter Moscos, as well as keyboard player David Bentley, formerly of Python Lee Jackson and best known for the hit "In A Broken Dream" which was sung by Rod Stewart.  
The band shortened their name to "Chicks" in 1979, but despite being signed with a major label, they had several problems finding and retaining competent members.  Their final appearance on an album was "Stormy Nights" on the compilation "That's Queensland" issued by radio station 4IP.  The song was a departure from their early dance orientated material and geared towards the electro-pop sound of the early 80's and the band eventually split up.  
Bass player Sue Neilson is very active on the Brisbane corporate rock music scene today, whilst Curtis died in early 2012.  Her husband Barry Petrel runs the Australian website Baby Boomers Website, and will be creating a page in memory of her musical achievements and service to her country and community.  Saxophonist Pamela Withnell joined the Sydney band The Party Girls after her departure from the band, and she now performs on the jazz scene.

The Captain Andrew Offutt Monument in Ryder Cemetery in eastern Lebanon, Kentucky, off US-68, is a monument on the National Register of Historic Places.  It honors Captain Andrew Offutt (November 9, 1837-October 7, 1921) who served as a Union officer in the 5th Kentucky Cavalry during the American Civil War, participating in General William Tecumseh Sherman's March.  It is speculated that he must have seen his actions during the war as his greatest life's act, as he lived for 56 years after the war, yet his family chose to depict him in his Union Army uniform.Civil War in KentuckyCivil War in Kentucky
The monument features a marble statue of Captain Andrew Offutt atop a granite base.  Offutt is seen in Union officer uniform, wearing a kepi hat and tunic length coat, with a sword extending downward.  On both sides of Offutt's grave are two other veterans of the War, one of whom was a Confederate who rode with John Hunt Morgan, Doctor W. W. Cleaver.
On July 17, 1997, the Captain Andrew Offutt Monument was one of sixty different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. It is one of the few monuments dedicated for a Union soldier/unit.  In fact, except for the Union Monument in Vanceburg, it is the only one to express strong sentiment for the Union cause, and this was only reflected by the monument mentioning Offutt's actions with General William T. Sherman.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Submission: Civil War Monuments in Kentucky, 1865-1935|1.81 MiB[/tpl]|date=January 8, 1997 |author=Joseph E.

He also counseled Rhodes to enlarge its navy by 40 ships, to increase the city's battle-readiness for whatever course of action that might need to be taken.  Seeing this, the Roman envoys Aulus Postumius and Tiberius Claudius returned to Rome confident of Rhodian support.
In 169 BC Agesilochus was himself sent as ambassador to Rome, with a Nicagoras son of Nicander, to propose a license for Rhodes to import grain from the Roman dominions; according to Polybius, this proposal was apparently successful.  In 168 BC he was one of the Rhodian envoys (along with Damon, Telephus and Nicostratus) sent to negotiate a peace with Perseus and Roman consul Aemilius Paullus in Macedonia.Polybius, xxvii. 3, xxviii. 2, 14, xxix. 4

[[Virtual manipulatives for mathematics]]
CATEGORIES: Mathematics education

Virtual manipulatives are a relatively new technology and are modeled after existing manipulatives such as base ten blocks, coins, blocks, tangrams, spinners, rulers, fraction bars, algebra tiles, geoboards, geometric plane, and solids figures. They are usually in the form of Java or Flash applets. Virtual manipulatives allow teachers to allow for efficient use of multiple representations and to provide concrete models of abstract mathematical concepts for learners of mathematics. Research suggests that students may also develop more connected understandings of mathematical concepts when they use virtual manipulatives (Moyer, Niezgoda, & Stanley, 2005).What are Virtual Manipulatives?
Many believe that virtual manipulatives can be particularly helpful to students with language difficulties, including English Language Learners (ELL). ELL students usually have trouble explaining what they are learning in mathematics classes. With virtual manipulatives, such students may be able to clarify their thoughts and demonstrate it to others in a much more effective way. For example, with base ten blocks, students may use the place-value layout to show their understanding.
Manipulatives by themselves have little meaning. It is important for teachers to make the mathematical meaning of manipulatives clear and help the  students to build connections between the concrete materials and abstract symbols. Virtual manipulatives usually have this built-in structure. Many virtual manipulative activities give students hints and feedback with pop-ups and help features. More traditional concrete manipulatives are not conducive to comprehension without direct instructor assistance. For example, in using tangrams, students can practically copy a design made from pattern blocks. When a block is near a correct location, it will snap into place. This virtual manipulative includes a hint function that will show the correct location of all the blocks.
Although relatively new, virtual manipulatives can support learning mathematics for all students which includes those with learning disabilities and ELL learners. Virtual manipulatives can be included into the general academic curriculum and not just used as an extra student activity. If they are used wisely, virtual manipulatives can provide students with opportunities for guided discovery which can help them to build a better understanding of mathematical concepts and ultimately exhibit measurable learning skills.

Rene Sylva (January 1929 – December 28, 2008) was a native Hawaiian botanist from Paia, Hawaii. He was among the only native Hawaiian fishermen to speak in favor of a ban on fishing green sea turtles."Former Turtle Fisherman Honored" Marine Turtle Newsletter 1994 After giving up a career in turtle fishing, he became involved in the conservation of native Hawaiian ecosystems. He assisted renowned botanists Otto Degener Otto Degener Records;  and Dr. Harold St. John in surveying remote regions of the Hawaiian Islands for native plants.Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for 10 Plant Taxa From Maui Nui, Hawaii | Federal Register Environmental Documents | USEPA 
In 1976, Sylva became the caretaker of the Maui Zoological and Botanical Gardens in Kahului, Hawaii, which later became known as the Maui Nui Botanical Gardens. Gradually he shifted the garden’s emphasis from exotic animals to plants unique to Maui, Moloka‘i, Lana‘i, and Kaho‘olawe--creating the first botanical garden in the state to focus on endemic plants. He personally collected and cultivated over 200 native coastal and dry forests species. He was widely considered the authority on the native flora of Maui County. 
Throughout his life, Sylva passionately defended native Hawaiian ecosystems. In an essay for the Native Hawaiian Plant Society, he wrote:
 
 “It is a good thing to classify plants as endangered, but we must realize that this does not save them from becoming extinct. It merely gives them paper protection. I recall when the first plant was entered on the endangered species list on April 26, 1978. It is still on that list today. As far as I know, no plant has ever come off the Endangered Species List. The only way for a plant to be removed from that list is to become extinct. To me, this is a disgraceful and insulting way of saving Hawaiian plants.”Endangered Plants Species 
He was active with many volunteer organizations, including the Honokowai restoration project, and the reforestation of Kaho‘olawe until suffering from a stroke in 2006. He is credited with mentoring numerous conservationists, including native plant nursery owner, Anna Palomino, and parataxonomists Forest and Kim Starr. For his efforts to conserve rare and endangered flora and fauna in Hawaii, Tetramolopium sylvae, an endangered species in the Asteraceae family was named in his honor.Flora of the Hawaiian Islands
Sylva served as a tank driver for the U.S. military during the Korean War.

CATEGORIES: Ancient Greek sites in Turkey, Roman towns and cities in Turkey, Cappadocia, Former populated places in Turkey

Padyandus or Podyandos ([tpl]Lang-el|Παδυανδός[/tpl], also Paduandus, Podandos or Podandus (Πόδανδος), and appearing corrupted in ancient sources as Opodanda, Opodandum, and Rhegepodandos, was an ancient town in Cataonia, the southernmost part of Cappadocia, in what is today Turkey. The town was located about 40 km to the southeast of Faustinopolis, near the pass of Mount Taurus known by the name of the Cilician Gates (Ptol. v. 7. § 7.). Extended by the emperor Valens (364-378), the town is mentioned in the itineraria, but its name assumes different forms; as Paduandus (Tab. Peut.), Podandos (It. Ant. p. 145), Mansio Opodanda (It. Hieros. p. 578), and Rhegepodandos (Hierocl. p 699). The place is described by Basilius (Epist. 74) as one of the most wretched holes on earth. It is said to have derived its name from a small stream in the neighborhood. (Const. Porphyr. Vit. Basil. 36; comp. Cedren. p. 575; Jo. Scylitz. Hist. pp. 829, 844.)  Due to similarity of name, tradition assigns the location of Padyandus to that of Pozantı, a position that modern scholars only tentatively accept.[tpl]Barrington|66 & notes[/tpl]

[[Louise Lamphere]]
CATEGORIES: American anthropologists, University of New Mexico faculty, Harvard University alumni, 1941 births, Living people

Louise Lamphere (born 1940[tpl]cite LAF|id=n85-346827[/tpl]) is an American anthropologist who has been distinguished professor of anthropology at the University of New Mexico since 2001. She was a faculty member at UNM from 1976-1979 and again from 1986-2009, when she became a Professor Emeritus. 
Lamphere received her Ph.D. from Harvard in 1968. She has published extensively throughout her career on subjects as diverse as the Navajo and their medicinal practices and de-industrialisation and urban anthropology; nonetheless she is possibly best known for her work on feminist anthropology and gender issues.
Lamphere was the co-editor, with Michele Zimbalist Rosaldo, of Woman, Culture, and Society, the first volume to address the anthropological study of gender and women's status. In the 1970s, after being denied tenure at Brown University, Lamphere brought a class action suit against Brown. She won an out-of-court settlement that served as a model for future suits by others.
In 2005 Lamphere supervised an ethnographic team which examined the impact of Medicaid managed care in New Mexico. The team published their articles in a special issue of Medical Anthropology Quarterly. In her introduction, she emphasized the impact of increased bureaucratization on women workers in health care clinics, emergency rooms and small doctors offices.
In 2013, she was awarded the Franz Boas Award for Exemplary Service to Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association.

SC Sélestat is a French football from the city of Sélestat in Alsace, France. It was established in 1912 as the German club SV Schlettstadt in what was at the time  Schlettstadt, Elsaß in Germany.
Following the Franco-Prussian War, the territories of Alsace and parts of Lorraine were ceded to Germany as Elsaß and Lothringen.  SV was formed out of the merger of predecessor sides Schlettstadter Fußball-Klub 1906 and Fußball-Klub Sport Schlettstadt and played as an undistinguished local side.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-89784-147-9 The disputed territories once again became part of France after World War I and Schlettstadt joined that country's football competition in 1920 as Sportclub Sélestat in the regional top-flight Division d'Honneur Alsace. The team won titles there in 1920 and 1922 and participated in the opening round of the Coupe de France de football in 1920-21. They went on to make other appearances in the opening round of the tournament through the 20s and 30s.
The region was re-conquered by Nazi Germany early in World War II and SV Schlettstadt resumed its former place in German football as part of the first division Gauliga Unterelsass in 1940. The team finished the season in last place and was relegated, but quickly returned to the top flight. They made a losing appearance in the qualifying round of play for the Tschammerspokal, predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1941, and then performed poorly in regular season competition over the next two years. The 1944-45 season of what was now the Gauliga Oberelsass was never started as Allied armies began their advance into Germany. The club resumed play in French competition after the war as SC Sélestat.
SC remains active today and has departments for badminton, bowling, handball, swimming, and volleyball. As of the 2007-08 season, the footballers play in Promotion A, Group D, of the Ligue d' Alsace - Bas Rhin (IX). With three games to play, the club sits on last place.Ligue d' Alsace, Promotion A, Group D - Table accessed: 21 May 2008 The club's handball team has become prominent nationally.

Faustinopolis (also Colonia Faustinopolis and Halala) was an ancient city in the south of Cappadocia, about 20 km south of Tyana. It was named after the empress Faustina, the wife of Marcus Aurelius, who died there in a village, which her husband, by establishing a colony in it, raised to the rank of a town under the name of Faustinopolis. (Jul. Capitol. M. Ant. Philos. 26.) Hierocles (p. 700) assigns the place to Cappadocia Secunda, and it is mentioned also in the Antonine and Jerusalem Itineraries. The town was close to the defiles of the Cilician Gates, and was likely situated at modern-day Başmakçı, Niğde Province, Turkey.[tpl]Barrington|66 & notes[/tpl] Following the Muslim conquests and the subsequent Arab raids, the site was abandoned for the nearby fortress of Loulon.

It is believed by some modern scholars that these seven deities, together known as the Satbibis (seven ladies) are transmogrifications of the Saptamatrikas (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Vaisnavi, Varahi, Indrani and others), but almost no similarity exists between the Saptamatrikas and the Satbibis. The collective worship of seven goddesses is even evidenced in prehistoric India by a terracotta seal found at Mohenjodaro, a major urban centre of the Indus Valley Civilisation located in Sindh, which depicts the image of seven women standing together.Basu, Gopendrakrishna (2008) 1966.

[[Professors in the United States]]

In the U.S., "professors" commonly occupy any of several positions in academia, typically the ranks of assistant professor, associate professor or full professor. The same terms are used outside the U.S., although often denote different roles from in the U.S. system.
Research and education are among the main tasks of professors with the amount of time spent on research or teaching depending strongly on the type of institution. Publication of articles in conferences, journals, and books is essential to occupational advancement. As of August 2007 teaching in tertiary educational institutions is one of the fastest growing occupations, topping the U.S. Department of Labor's list of "above average wages and high projected growth occupations," with a projected increase of 524,000 positions between 2004 and 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/spotlight/|title=U.S. Department of Labor. (August, 2007). Spotlight on Statistics: Back to School.|accessdate=October 11, 2007[/tpl] In 2011, a survey conducted by TIAA-CREF Institute senior researcher Paul J. Yakabushki estimated that 73% of professors with senior tenure ranged between the ages of 60 and 66 and that the remaining 27% were above the age of 66.  Yakabushki estimated that 75% of these professors have acknowledged that they have made no preparations for retirement due to the ongoing financial crisis and reluctance to leave their profession.

A 2013 survey conducted by Fidelity Investments would echo similar results when the question about retirement came up.

[[Maurice (Shelley)]]
CATEGORIES: 1820 books, British children's novels

Maurice, or the Fisher's Cot is a children's story by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Written in 1820 for Laurette Tighe, a daughter of friends of Percy and Mary Shelley, Mary Shelley tried to have it published by her father, William Godwin, but he refused. The text was lost until 1997, when a manuscript copy was rediscovered in Italy, exciting both the scholarly community and the general public.
Maurice tells the story of a boy searching for a home and his encounters with a traveller who turns out to be his long-lost father. The story is narrated in a melancholy tone from several points of view and focuses on the theme of loss, particularly the separation of parents and children. Shelley explored this partly autobiographical theme in other works written at the time, including her novel Mathilda and her play Proserpine. The story's straightforward language reflects that of the Romantic poet William Wordsworth, whose works Shelley was reading while she composed Maurice.

[[Kenny Bruce Williams]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in the Left Behind series

Kenny Bruce Williams is a fictional character in the Left Behind series, by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.
Kenny is the son of Cameron "Buck" Williams and Chloe Steele Williams, named after martyred believers Ken Ritz and Bruce Barnes. He is born during the Tribulation, in the book Apollyon. He is taken care of by his grandfather, Rayford Steele, when Buck goes to Jerusalem to help defend it in Armageddon. He is reunited with his parents in Glorious Appearing. Jesus promises Buck and Chloe that because they lost Kenny they would be repaid by the hundredfold. Because of that they start a massive daycare ministry called COT(Children of the Tribulation), which focused on teaching children and trying to show them that Jesus is the only way. Kenny is the first child in COT.
Ninety-some years later, Kenny is working at COT and is now living on his own. When one of the workers, Cendrillon Jospin dies at one hundred, It creates an uproar among the believers since only unbelievers die. Not wanting anyone to follow Cendrillon's path, but knowing many will, Kenny, Raymie Steele, Bahira Abaneh, and Zaki Abaneh form the Millennium Force, a branch off of the Tribulation Force. 
At Cendrillon's funeral, Kenny (who has the only non-glorified body of the four) meets Cendrillon's cousins from France, who are in deep with TOL (The Other Light), a secret organization that worships Lucifer. He goes under cover for the  Millennium Force. He also meets Ekaterina Risto and falls in love with her. When a friend of Zaki, Qasim Marid, goes undercover for the Force without their permission, they all start to wonder where his loyties lie. When Kenny goes to France, he meets up with the Johpins and their other cousin, Nicolette. They head to Jordan where Kenny is seen by Abdullah Smith. After being accused of switching loyties, he is kicked out of the Millennium Force, deserted by Ekaterina, and hardly believed by his parents. 
This causes Kenny's life to fall apart, and while he is extremely lonely, he trusts in God to deliver him in the end. Kat finally goes to talk to Kenny and realizes that he is innocent. Qasim is discovered as the real infiltrator at COT and fired, eventually dying at the age of one hundred along with the Johpins and Nicolette.

José Raimundo Arcia Orta (born August 22, 1943 in Havana, Cuba) is a former Utility infielder in Major League Baseball who played  from 1968 to 1970for the Chicago Cubs and San Diego Padres. Arcia was signed as an amateur free agent by the Houston Colt .45s in 1962 but would not make his major league debut for six years.
Arcia's rather circuitous route to the majors was notable in that he was traded three times as a minor leaguer, from Houston to the Detroit Tigers, from the Tigers to the Cleveland Indians, and from the Indians to the St. Louis Cardinals. Finally, in 1967's Rule 5 draft, the Cubs selected Arcia from the Cardinals organization. He opened the 1968 season as a member of the Cubs and remained with the club the whole season, batting .190 in 58 games as a rookie, hitting his only Major League home run, and playing six positions in the field. Despite his subpar offensive performance, Arcia found himself coveted again, selected by the Padres in the 1968 MLB expansion draft.
Arcia saw considerable playing time over the next two seasons with San Diego, serving as a rather versatile utility man. The only positions he did not play in his career were catcher and pitcher. His poor offense continued, however, as he hit .215 and .223 in 1969 and 1970 respectively, with singles accounting for 90 of his 116 hits. He also proved to be an unreliable baserunner, caught stealing in 13 of his 30 attempts those two years, though he did lead the Padres with 14 stolen bases in 1969.
Arcia's last game as a big leaguer was September 30, 1970.

[[Yao Shouzhong]]

CATEGORIES: Yuan dynasty poets, 14th-century writers, People from Luoyang, Writers from Henan

The Chinese poet Yao Shouzhong 姚守中 is thought to have been from the city of Luoyang 洛陽 in present Henan 河南. He dates are unclear. However, he seems to have been the nephew of the writer and official Yao Sui 姚燧 who lived from 1238 to 1313. Yao Shouzhong would then have lived in the early 14th century. Likewise, this Yao Sui was  himself the nephew of the celebrated official and scholar Yao Shu (1203–1280). The greater family had its origins in the Manchurian province of Liaoning and later moved to Luoyang. Yao Shouzhong appears to have been a local official functionary in Pingjiang in Hunan. The Lu Guibu 彔鬼簿 notes only that Yao was a literary talent from the previous generation. "The Ox’s Grievance" (Niu Suyuan) 牛訴冤 is the only surviving literary work of the writer, although titles of the three of his plays have survived. Tao’s Sanqu suite, "The Ox’s Grievance" (Niu Suyuan), is a classic of the genre and is one of the great imaginative poems in the genre of Chinese Sanqu poetry and Chinese literature as a whole. Although it has been suggested that "The Ox's Grievance" is a social satire, more likely it was intended as a literary burlesque or parody.
The Ox's Grievance  
1.
By nature slow and stupid,
I lived in Misty Village doing farm work.
Ugly I was, but painters came to paint me.
In Apricot Village,
In Peach Glade Fields,
There were spring winds;
Beyond the scattered trees the sun went down.
I carried a flute playing boy home on my back.
2.
I loved spring plowing in the green fields,
A single plow by the rainy river.
Then I harrowed and was whipped along.
I suffered from my masters,
Suffered,
Suffered!
Through driving winds and beating rain,
Bitter cold and boiling heat.
From morning fog to evening mist.
3.
We oxen pasture near the river ford’s grassy bank,
Play and wander near the green-willowed shore
Of the red-waterweed lake.
Painters come to paint me for rural style paintings.
We work the fields alone or work in teams.
We have carried old sages into the mountains,
Helped generals in their battles;
There are ancient and modern tales and songs about us.
4.
Plowed mornings, plowed evenings, wasted my time.
Who was my hardship for?
One day I fell sick in the middle of the road.
I saw a high minister, and he questioned the farmers,
“Why is this old ox panting and wheezing?”
When he heard the story he sighed and sighed.
He admonished the farmers before he left,
Taking my name to the emperor.
5.
The emperor proclaimed that I enrich the state,
That I suffered a thousand, ten thousand hardships.
My kind at the waterways pull along ships.
At river crossings pull across carts.
By nature brave and strong,
Oxen are afraid of not even tigers!
In addition he said my keeper would be Wang Liu,
And I would assist at only festivals and ceremonies.
6.
The secretariat obeyed the emperor,
Affixed his seals and sent off the orders.
“All officials and constables
Will carry out the orders strictly and diligently.”
The law went down to the villages,
For the leaders of clans,
“Arrest anyone killing an ox.”
7.
Then the lovers of ox flesh grew no fatter,
Sellers of oxen grew no richer.
Of an ox grew old, He was not slaughtered, but left to die of old age.
Oxen were not work or plow.
The lower officials were instructed;
Reports were to be sent to the capital;
People should shun even dead oxen,
Leaving their bones unburied.
8.
Having grieved and suffered injustice;
For spring toil was completed.
I looked forward to living in leisure.
Then one day at the gate to the corral,
Two men came to look me over.
One was an ex-monk Xin from Nanzhuang,
And another was a butcher Wang from Beijiang.
How they made my heart beat faster!
If I am taken and sold, I thought,
My life would last only a second.
9.
My heart was fearful,
My whole being unsettled.
I could not bear them taking my blood
Even to anoint the sacrificial bell.
Why did they think a plowing ox best?
My keeper was a schemer and profit hungry;
They gave him money and took me away.
He didn’t even look as they led me down the road.
I sighed and I panted,
My eyes fearful with tears like pearls.
Murderers!
Murderers!
Their greedy natures were poisonous, wolfish.
They took and tied me to a butcher post.
10.
As they stared at me,
I only saw the knives in the hands.
I roared and stamped as my soul joined the shades.
My blood stained and covered the ground.
They cleaved the flesh from my bones,
The hide from my shoulders.
A sharp knife ripped and a thin blade sliced.
I was weighed on scales official and private.
The authorities just stood by the road and gawked.
What was left of me was put by the roadside for sale.
While Zhang Tanya took my loins,
Li Gungping wanted my chops.
11.
Having heard my screams, they still wanted to eat my flesh.
They cleared a space and boiled me in a cooker;
Cooked me until I was tasty and crisp.
They called in my old keeper,
He said for a thirty percent outlay he made a hundred percent profit.
Who thought to ask me, the one who lost his body forever?
Then there were those noble fellows who put on airs.
They wanted to eat and eat right there,
Then take some home to cook for their families.
12.
They wrapped me in meat pies for special guests,
Folded me in dumplings for invited friends.
Took me to the jar and slow cooked me with pepper and onions;
Better than dog meat for fighting the cold!
Superior to mutton for gaining strength.
You filled your belly bags full.
What about my life?
13.
I should have been the calf left to pasture;
But instead became the only bull in the field.
All for nothing my bitter battle of farming.
My keeper, just like all the other heartless and cruel.
I was a thing of monetary value!
With me fields and gardens are started.
Without me granaries are barren and bare.
14.
Clay oxen were made to pray for the spring;
Stone oxen were worshipped to bring the rain.
Now the earth-moving oxen are executed;
With whom will the deer roam the slopes?
The goats near the wheat fields have lost their friend.
This is what breaks the heart –
Never to see again the quarter moon through the willows,
Evening crows in the ancient trees.
15.
My sinews were made into bowstrings,
Hide stretched into drumheads.
My bones were sold to a jewelry maker,
Black horns made into ornaments for belts.
My hooves were fashioned into fancy combs;
Nothing was wasted, all was used.
My best hide was sold to a boot maker,
The scraps were sent back to my old keeper.
16.
I did not live out my years,
In death I was truly wronged!
I tell you Yama, Ruler of Shades,
I have no selfish motives;
Of bitterness in life,
I have suffered more than my share.

The TJFF was also an Imperial Service regiment whose Imperial Service soldiers agreed to serve wherever required and not just within the borders of their own colony, protectorate or, in the case of the Transjordan, mandate. This was in contrast to the Arab Legion, which was seen more as an internal security militia, deriving from the troops of the Arab Revolt and closely associated with the Hashemite cause.

He served as the Director of Counseling for the Christian Broadcasting Network's The 700 Club for seven years prior to conducting his research for Treatment Theory and Therapy. He was elected to Who's Who in Leading American Executives in 1991 and has been awarded honorary doctorates and citations such as the Eagles Award and Good Shepherd Award. His education includes Shaw University (B.A.), Valley Christian University (M.A.), Faith Theological Seminary (D. Psy.), Andrew Jackson University (Ph.D.) and Jacksonville Theological Seminary (D.D.). 
In addition to serving as the Chaplain of the N.C.C.A., Dr. Arno is also the President of The National Board of Christian Clinical Therapists and serves as the Resident Bishop of The National Conservative Church, a worldwide denomination.
Dr. Arno has been very active researching the concept of temperament, and discovered a fifth temperament (Supine) which has been added to the more ancient theory of four temperaments. The Five Temperaments in addition include Choleric, Melancholy, Sanguine and Phlegmatic.  This theory provides the foundation for an entire model of Christian Counseling, collectively known as Creation Therapy.  The premise is that if a counselor can know the inborn temperament of an individual and compare it to the current life experience of that individual, disparities between what that person wants, needs and actually receives can be revealed. Appropriate measures taken to correct these imbalances can promote healing.

The Loren L. Chadwick Cottages are two cottages in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, in the Linden Hills neighborhood situated roughly south of Lake Calhoun and northwest of Lake Harriet.  This area of Minneapolis was platted in 1882-83 as "Cottage City" by a local real estate developer, Louis Menage.  He platted small lots of [tpl]convert|25|ft[/tpl] wide, as opposed to the normal lot width of [tpl]convert|40|ft[/tpl], in an effort to attract people who wanted to build summer lake cottages.[tpl]cite book |last=Millett |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Millett |title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul |year=2007 |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press |location= |isbn=0-87351-540-4 |pages=p. 244[/tpl]
Loren L. Chadwick built these two cottages in 1902 at a cost of $300 each.  They were small, measuring [tpl]convert|16|ft[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|30|ft[/tpl], and had screened porches to take advantage of summer breezes from the nearby lakes.  The two cottages were rented out as summer homes for more than a decade before they were bought by individual owners.  In 1972, a new owner joined the two cottages with an addition on the rear.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/40th_St_W_2617_Chadwick_Cottages.asp|title=Chadwick Cottages|publisher=Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission|accessdate=2008-05-20[/tpl]  The cottages were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  They are significant because although their design is simple, their survival demonstrates a good example of cottage architecture in Minneapolis. Despite their simplicity, the cottages have Carpenter Gothic detailing on the vergeboards of their gable and porch roofs.

Historic Fire Station No. 19, now the site of a Buffalo Wild Wings, and the architectural firm Station 19 Architects [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.station19.com |title=Station 19 Architects |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States is centered in the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis campus. The former Fire Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1893 in an era when Minneapolis was growing rapidly. Rapid development was bringing prosperity to Minneapolis, but it was also starting to tax the city's infrastructure. Residents and businesses on the east bank of the Mississippi River were demanding better fire protection, especially after the fire that consumed the University of Minnesota Old Main building in 1892 along with some grain elevators nearby. Fire Station No. 19 was built in a simple utilitarian style (unique to Minneapolis), yet it contained some touches of ornamentation. It was built with a bell tower that was later removed. The fire station was one of the last to house horse-drawn equipment, as late as 1922. A newer Fire Station 19 was occupied in 1976 one block to the south.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/University_Ave_SE_2001_Fire_Station_19.asp |title=Fire Station #19 |publisher=Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070621131509/http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/hpc/landmarks/University_Ave_SE_2001_Fire_Station_19.asp |archivedate=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]
Besides its role as a firehouse, Historic Fire Station No. 19 was also the birthplace of kittenball, a variant of softball. Louis Rober, a lieutenant at the fire station between 1896 and 1906, adapted the rules of baseball to create a game that would use less space, time, and equipment than a regular baseball game. He created the game so firefighters could get exercise while waiting for a fire alarm. Early teams included the "Kittens" of Engine Company 19, "Rats" of Engine Company 9, "Whales" of Engine Company 4, "Salisburys" from a mattress factory, "Pillsburys" from nearby flour mills, and the "Central Avenues". By 1906, more than 20 teams were playing in summer leagues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.extraalarm.org/ltrober.htm |title=Minneapolis F.D.

There was some concern in the mid-2000s decade that the University of Minnesota would have the structure demolished to make way for rearranged roads leading to and from the then-unbuilt TCF Bank Stadium. The university made offers to purchase the property into early 2006, and the building owners worried that the property would be seized through eminent domain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bridgelandnews.org/783 |title=Alarm bells going off at old Station 19 |first=Bill |last=Hoffmann |work=Minneapolis Bridgeland News |date=March 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090809225002/http://www.bridgelandnews.org/783 |archivedate=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl] However, the roads were eventually routed around the building, making it the only structure on a small island across from the stadium.

CATEGORIES: 1970s toys, Action figures, Mattel

Pulsar: The Ultimate Man of Adventure was an action figure for boys made by Mattel in 1976. Pulsar was a 14" action figure looked like a handsome middle aged man with short white hair. However once you opened his sweat suit top it revealed that his entire torso was clear plastic which allowed viewing of his internal organs. There was a button on his back that when depressed would make his lungs and heart pump and force simulated blood through some simulated arteries and veins in the body cavity. In addition to having visible innards, Pulsar's head could flip open and a holographic mission disk (a small lenticular plastic disk) could be placed inside. The literature provided with this toy said that this was his mission program disc. There were two versions of the doll, the difference between the two being that the second version of Pulsar had his lower waist and groin painted to match his skin color thus disguising the rubber connectors for where the legs attached to the pelvis. Some also claim that the second version has a more expressive and friendlier face. There never was a back story given to Pulsar, he was just the "Ultimate Man of Adventure". His strange biology could make one think he is an alien, an evolved human cyborg or a combination of these possibilities. The only other toys to be developed for the Pulsar toy line were his nemesis Hypnos: The Ultimate Enemy and Pulsar's Life Systems Center which was a medical bay style wall that Pulsar could be placed inside. Pulsar was patented in 1976 but Mattel toys did not produce him until 1977.

The William Rotch, Jr. House, now the Rotch-Jones-Duff House and Garden Museum, is a National Historic Landmark at 396 County Street in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the United States. The three families whose names are attached to it were all closely tied to the city's nineteenth-century dominance of the whaling industry. Because of this, the house is part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park.
Richard Upjohn built the house in the Greek Revival architectural style for William Rotch, Jr. in 1834, on a New Bedford plot Rotch had inherited from his father. It was Upjohn's first house, near the beginning of a long career. Rotch also commissioned a garden in the rear, which later owners would significantly expand. The property remained private until 1981, when it was bought by local preservationists and reopened as a historic house museum. It was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.[tpl]Cite document|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Historic Landmark Nomination: Rotch, William Jr., House / Rotch-Jones-Duff House|32 KB[/tpl]|date=January 3, 2004 |author=Kathryn Grover, Derek J.

The Arthur D. Little Inc., Building is a National Historic Landmark at 30 Memorial Drive
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The building was constructed in 1917 for the Arthur D. Little Company alongside the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Arthur D. Little Company was founded in 1886 by Arthur Dehon Little, and was originally located on Milk Street in Boston.  The three story brick building on Memorial Drive was constructed by the company to meet increasing demand for laboratory space, and is an architecturally unexceptional commercial structure.  The building was declared a National Historic Landmark for its association with the Little company, the first business to be established as a consulting laboratory in the nation.  Prior to its founding, individual businesses established their own research laboratories to make technological innovations.  Little, and his partner William H. Walker, were among the first academically oriented researchers to create a consulting laboratory whose services could be hired by businesses.  At first focused on the chemistry of cellulose and its uses in textiles and paper, the company was by 1909 the largest consulting industrial laboratory in the nation, and worked a wide array of research disciplines.  Little was an early advocate of the importance of technological innovation, recognizing its importance in maintaining commercial success. He ran the company until is death in 1935, and willed his shares to MIT.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/76001970.pdf|title=NHL nomination for Arthur D.

[[Vesperae solennes de Dominica (Mozart)]]

CATEGORIES: Compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1779 compositions, Choral compositions, Psalm settings

Vesperae solennes de Dominica, K. 321, is a sacred work composed in 1779 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is scored for SATB soloists, SATB choir, violin I, violin II, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones colla parte, 2 timpani, and basso continuo (bassoon and organ). 
It was composed in Salzburg at the request of the Archbishop Colloredo for liturgical use in the city's cathedral. The title "de Dominica" signifies its use in Sunday services.[tpl]cite book|title=Mozart|author=Robert Gutnam|year=2011|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=gu-kvXUiVd0C&pg=PT560&lpg=PT560&dq=%22vesperae+solennes%22+sunday|accessdate=21 February 2013[/tpl] 
The setting is divided into six movements, including five psalms and a setting of the Magnificat. A setting of the Minor Doxology (Gloria Patri) concludes all movements, each recapitulating the opening theme. The first three psalms are scored in a vigorous, exuberant manner, contrasting with the strict counterpoint of the a capella Laudate pueri. The Laudate Dominum is set as an extended aria for the soprano soloist, while the Magnificat opens with a majestic, moderate tempo, only to return to the bolder tempo of the first three psalms.[tpl]cite book|title=Mozart: His Character, His Work|author=Alfred Einstein, Arthur Mendel|year=1945|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ep4PXMszMv4C&lpg=PA345&dq=%22vesperae%20solennes%22%20colloredo&pg=PA343#v=onepage&q=vesperae&f=false|accessdate=21 February 2013[/tpl] 
In 1780, Mozart composed another setting of the Vespers, the Vesperae solennes de confessore, which shares many musical similarities with this work.

The General Benjamin Lincoln House is a National Historic Landmark at 181 North Street in Hingham, Massachusetts, USA.  It was the birthplace and principal residence of Continental Army Major General Benjamin Lincoln (1733–1810), a well-respected military leader of the American Revolutionary War.  The house has portions that may date to the 1630s, with significant additions made principally during the 18th century.  The last major modifications to the house were probably undertaken by General Lincoln in the late 18th century.
The house remains, as of 2009, in the hands of Lincoln family descendants, and is not normally open to the public.  Changes to the interior and exterior are authorized only in consultation with Historic New England, a major regional historic preservation society.

He was largely self-taught, though may also have studied with Marengo-Rinaldi. Through beautiful copies of important violins by Guadagnini, Pressenda, Oddone and Rocca, he transmitted the tradition of the 18th and 19th Century Piedmontese masters and made it his own. He exhibited at Genoa and Milan in 1906 where he gained international recognition and his business blossomed. He gradually developed his own style, and made his best instruments during the 1920s.

Tim Lenahan is the head men's soccer coach at Northwestern University. He has been coaching there since the start of the 2001 season. He is widely regarded as one of the top coaches in the Big Ten, as he rebuilt the Northwestern program from a team that had been winless over 35 games in 2000 and 2001 to a national power. His teams have made seven NCAA tournament appearances in the past nine seasons  Northwestern has earned 108 wins over the past nine seasons, including 15 in 2004, and 14 in 2006, 12 in 2007 and 15 in 2008, and 13 in 2012.
In 2004, the 'Cats burst on to the national scene ending Indiana's 50 game Big Ten unbeaten streak.  Northwestern had been 4-67-4 in Big Ten play up until the Indiana win and had not won a Big Ten game in 27 tries.   The 'Cats won 15 games and qualified for the NCAA for the first time in school history.  In 2006, Northwestern advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, defeating Cincinnati, St.Louis, and UNC Greensboro in the first three rounds. They lost in the fourth round to UC Santa Barbara, 3-2 after leading the game 2-1 . Northwestern finished 8th in the final rankings thanks to their impressive tournament run.  In 2007, Northwestern climbed as high as #3 in the NSCAA polls and earned the first bye in their history when they were seeded #9 in the NCAA Tournament.  Dave Roth was named the first All-American in Northwestern Soccer history.  2008 saw another run to the NCAA Elite Eight and a national ranking of as high as #2.  They remained at the ranking of #2 for over a month and put together a 13 game unbeaten streak to start the season.   After a tough final stretch, Northwestern rebounded in the NCAA Tournament to defeat Loyola, Notre Dame and Akron before falling to North Carolina in the Elite Eight in Chapel Hill.  Their final ranking of #7 was an all-time best.  In 2009, Northwestern responded with another strong season advancing to the Sweet Sixteen and a final RPI of 9th nationally.  Mark Blades became the first two-time All-American in school history.    Northwestern's RPI over the  four seasons from 2006-2009 ranked as the 5th best nationally trailing only Wake Forest, Indiana, Virginia  and Maryland and are one of only five teams to make it as far as the Elite Eight twice in the three years between 2006 and 2008.
2011 saw Northwestern and Lenahan accomplish the rare undefeated double in winning the Big Ten Regular Season and Big Ten Tournament.  In 2012, the Wildcats repeated as Big Ten Regular Season and reached the NCAA Sweet Sixteen.  It was the fourth time Lenahan and Northwestern have reached at least the Sweet Sixteen in the last seven years.
Lenahan previously served as the head soccer coach at Lafayette College, where he turned their fortunes around winning four Patriot League Titles (Two Patriot League Tournament Championships and Two Patriot League Regular Season Championships) in his three years (1998-2001) after taking over a team that had gone 4-12 in each of the two years prior to his arrival.
Prior to Lafayette, Lenahan built Richard Stockton College into a Division III national power going to the NCAA Tournament in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996 and also capturing Richard Stockton's first NJAC Championship in 1996.  Richard Stockton had been 2-15 the year prior to his arrival.
Lenahan has been named either conference or NSCAA regional Coach of the Year in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1998, 2004, and 2011.  He is a two-time winner of the Bob Voigts Coach of the Year at Northwestern and the only male recipient of the award to date.
In addition to coaching success, Lenahan's mentorship has proven to be a springboard for some of the nation's top coaches.  His former assistant coaches include current head coaches Jeff Haines, Richard Stockton College; Fernando Barboto, Iona College; Dennis Bohn, Lafayette College; Justin Serpone, Amherst College; Erik Ronning, Colgate University;  Tom Carlin, Villanova University; Andy Fleming, Xavier University, Rich Nassif, Benedictine University,  and most recently Neil Jones, Loyola University - Chicago
His career coaching record stands at 250-147-56(.602)

The Cleveland Panthers were a professional American football team that competed in the first American Football League, founded by Charles "C.C". Pyle, (1882-1939), [also nicknamed as "Cash and Carry" Pyle), in 1926. Owned by General Charles X. Zimmerman, (1865-1926), (the vice president of the earlier AFL),“A.F.L. Fields Nine Teams”, New York Times, July 17, 1926 the Panthers played their home games in old Luna Bowl in Luna Park. Coached by Roy E. Watts, the team drew its players from Ohio colleges and universities and raided the rosters of early National Football League teams based in Ohio David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch, The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present (St. Martin’s Press 1994), ISBN 0-312-11435-4
The veteran squad led by tailback Al Michaels was one of only two AFL franchises (the other was the New York Yankees)  to average more than 12 points per game. Other former Cleveland Bulldogs Dave Noble and Doc Elliott helped provide offensive firepower, while two-sport star Cookie Cunningham excelled at end, scoring twice on long passes in an October 3, 1926, game against the Los Angeles Wildcats.1926 American Football League from Elias Sports Bureau and Pro Football Research Association Linescore Committee
In terms of fan support, the Panthers appeared to have had a good start, defeating the Yankees in their first game, at Luna Bowl in front of a reported 22,000 people, but after a second home victory (17-13, against the Wildcats) in which the attendance figures were apparently not reported, and a third straight home win (this time 23-7 against the Rock Island Independents) in front of only 7000 people, it was becoming evident that the Panthers were in trouble despite being in first place with an undefeated record. A 19-12 defeat in front of only 3000 spectators in Chicago's baseball Comiskey Park (the stadium of the Chicago White Sox), foreshadowed the inevitable as the similarly-troubled Newark Bears withdrew from the league on October 24, 1926.
The next week, the Panthers returned home to old Luna Park for a rematch with the Los Angeles Wildcats, a hard fought game dominated by defense, with Cleveland guard Al Nesser dictating much of the game until a fourth quarter fumble by Al Michaels led to the only score of the game in a 6-0 Wildcats win. While the game was stellar, the attendance was not: only 1000 fans saw it. Shortly after the end of the game, the Panthers called it quits.

Four Panthers subsequently found roster spots on AFL and NFL teams to complete the 1926 season, while six who had played in the NFL had their professional football careers end with the demise of the Cleveland Panthers.
The exodus from the AFL continued through November 1926, and after the last official game was played (December 12, 1926), the league itself went out of business.
The "Cleveland Panthers" name had come from an independent team that had played several years before and would continue for several years afterward. The independent Panthers, founded in 1919 from the remains of the Youngstown Patricians,http://www.billsbackers.com/1919Prospects.htm had played, with various degrees of success, continuously since 1919 and eventually, as fewer opponents played them each year after 1926, sputtered to a quiet folding in 1933.Sye, Roy.

It was once the center of a large farm. The house and several outbuildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well-preserved examples of that style in Ulster County.
When built, it marked a significant departure from the New Paltz area's previous styles, which tended toward stone houses in vernacular styles used by the area's Belgian Huguenot settlers. It has seen many modifications since then, but still remains true to its original concept. The Eltinge family has owned the house continuously as part of its 250-year ownership of the land.

The Nauset Archaeological District (or "Coast Guard Beach Site,19BN374" or "North Salt Pond Site,19BN390") is a National Historic Landmark District in Eastham, Massachusetts.   Located within the southern portion of the Cape Cod National Seashore, this area was the location of substantial ancient settlements since at least 4,000 BC.
The first written account of this area was by Samuel de Champlain in 1605, in which he described sailing into a bay surrounded by the wigwams of the Nauset tribe (see map, right).  The account detailed the settlement's crops (e.g.  corn, beans, squash, tobacco), housing (round wigwams covered with thatched reeds), and clothing (woven from grasses, hemp, and animal skins).  De Champlain's map also depicts one of their fishing methods, using a conical weir constructed of saplings and grass rope, designed to capture fish swimming from the marsh into a pond.  To farm the land, they used stone hoes and fire-hardened wood tools.  About 150 people were living at the site around Nauset Harbor, and about 500-600 were living around Stage Harbor to the south in the area of present day Chatham.  Archaeological studies have since shown that these settlements were occupied year-round.
After 1620, English colonists from the settlement at Plymouth visited Nauset many times to buy food and trade.  In addition to goods for trade, however, the Europeans also unwittingly introduced diseases, for which the Nauset people had no immunity.  Many of them died as a result, and their population declined drastically. In 1639 about half of the English from Plymouth relocated to the Nauset area, settling the town that is now Eastham.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.[tpl]NRISref|2008a[/tpl]  The area can be visited via the Fort Hill area of the Cape Cod National Seashore, off U. S. Route 6, where the Fort Hill and Red Maple Swamp trails wind from the top of the hill to the marsh and beyond.

The New Bedford Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District in New Bedford, Massachusetts, United States, west of the community's waterfront. During the 19th century, when the city was the center of the American whaling industry, this was its downtown. After its decline in the early and mid-20th century, through the efforts of local activist groups the district has since been preserved and restored to appear much as it was during that period.
Most of its buildings were erected between 1790 and 1855 by Russell Warren and other builders working in the Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles. Many of them reflect the legacy of whaling in the city's development. The district was designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL) and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Later it was recognized as a local historic district and protected by  local zoning. One building within it, the U.S. Customhouse, is the oldest such facility currently in use and has been independently recognized as an NHL. Since 1996 the district has also been a part of New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park.

The Confederate Monument in Danville, located between Centre College and the First Presbyterian Church at the corner of Main and College Streets in Danville, Kentucky's McDowell Park, is a monument dedicated to the Confederate States of America that is on the National Register of Historic Places. The monument was dedicated in 1910 by the surviving veterans of the Confederacy of Boyle County, Kentucky and the Kate Morrison Breckinridge Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg4/danville.html |title=Danville KY Confederate Monument |accessdate=2009-09-28 |work=Trails-R-Us Monuments |publisher=WMTH Corporation [/tpl]
The monument consists of a granite pedestal and a marble statue resting thereon. The marble figure depicts Captain Robert D. Logan, who actually came from Lincoln County, Kentucky, but lived after the War in Boyle County. Captain Logan served under John Hunt Morgan in the 6th Kentucky Cavalry's Company A, and was captured after Morgan's Raid in Cheshire, Ohio on July 20, 1863, and spent much of the War afterwards in prison camps, particularly the Ohio State Penitentiary. He died on June 25, 1896, fourteen years before the construction of the monument. The granite pedestal is twelve feet tall, and uses pairs of Doric columns to decorate it. The main inscription reads: C. S. A. 1861 - 1865 What They Were the Whole World Knows.
Danville's participation in the War was limited.  The courthouse served as a hospital for Union forces after the Battle of Perryville.  On October 11, Confederate forces retreated through the city with a Union force behind them.  Danville was also the birthplace of Theodore O'Hara, whose Bivouac of the Dead would be a popular poem placed in various cemeteries for the War's dead.KY:Historical Society - Historical Marker Database - Search for Markers
It was after the War that the citizens of Danville showed their level of respect for the Confederacy. Many of the citizens of Danville gave up their eventual burial spots in 1868 to form a Confederate cemetery, with 66 fallen Confederate soldiers reinterred in the cemetery.  Danville National Cemetery would eventually be built next to the Confederate cemetery, but would be a place to inter former Union troops.[tpl]cite news | first=Andy | last=Bryant | title=Looking Back: Where have all the soldiers gone? | date=2008-05-05 | url =http://www.amnews.com/stories/2008/05/05/his.40608.sto | work =The Advocate Messenger | accessdate = 2009-10-07 [/tpl]
On July 17, 1997, the Confederate Monument in Danville was one of sixty different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission. Three other monuments on the MPS are also in Boyle County, all of which commemorate the Battle of Perryville.

[[Velocity air meter]]
CATEGORIES: Engine technology

A Velocity air meter measures the force of air rushing into an engine against a spring-loaded door in an air tunnel.  A linear potentiometer rotated along with the hinge of the air door measures the angle of the opening and sends an electrical signal to the engine control unit (ECU) that changes as the door opens more or less.  The ECU can deduce airflow into the engine based on this value after making certain corrections.  The problem is that the force against the door is a function of two variables - weight of the air and speed of the air - and the ECU cannot distinguish, for a given door angle, whether the air is less dense but traveling faster or whether the air is denser but traveling more slowly.  Therefore air velociy must be corrected for air density (temperature and barometric pressure) in order to reflect air mass (actual number of air molecules entering the engine per unit of time).

[[Multimedia telephony]]
CATEGORIES: IMS services, Multimedia, Network architecture, VoIP terminology & concepts, Mobile telecommunications standards, Telecommunications infrastructure

The 3GPP/NGN IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) multimedia telephony service (MMTel) is a global standard based on the IMS, offering converged, fixed and mobile real-time multimedia communication using the media capabilities such as voice, real-time video, text, file transfer and sharing of pictures, audio and video clips. With MMTel, users have the capability to add and drop media during a session. You can start with chat, add voice (for instance Mobile VoIP), add another caller, add video, share media and transfer files, and drop any of these without losing or having to end the session.
The MMTel standard is a joint project between the 3GPP and ETSI/TISPAN standardization bodies. The MMTel standard is today the only global standard that defines an evolved telephony service that enables real-time multimedia communication with the characteristics of a telephony service over both fixed broadband, fixed narrowband and mobile access types. MMTel also provides a standardized network-to-network interface (NNI). This allow operators to interconnect their networks which in turn enables users belonging to different operators to communicate with each other, using the full set of media capabilities and supplementary services defined within the MMTel service definition.
One of the main differences with the MMTel standard is that, in contrast of legacy circuit switched telephony services, IP transport is used over the mobile access. This means that the mobile access technologies that are in main focus for MMTel are access types such as high-speed packet access (HSPA), 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE) and EDGE Evolution that all are developed with efficient IP transport in mind.
MMTel allows a single SIP session to control virtually all MMTel supplementary services and MMTel media. All available media components can easily be accessed or activated within the session. Employing a single session for all media parts means that no additional sessions need to be set up to activate video, to add new users, or to start transferring a file. Even though it is possible to manage single-session user scenarios with several sessions – for instance, using a circuit-switched voice service that is complemented with a packet-switched video session, a messaging service or both – there are some concrete benefits to MMTel’s single-session approach. A single SIP session in an all-IP environment benefits conferencing; in particular, lip synchronization, which is quite complex when the voice part is carried over a circuit-switched service and the video part is carried over a packet-switched service. In fixed-mobile convergence scenarios, the single-session approach enables all media parts of the multimedia communication solution to interoperate.

[[Equal incircles theorem]]
CATEGORIES: Euclidean geometry, Japanese mathematics, Recreational mathematics, Elementary special functions, Theorems in plane geometry

In geometry, the equal incircles theorem derives from a Japanese Sangaku, and pertains to the following construction: a series of rays are drawn from a given point to a given line such that the inscribed circles of the triangles formed by adjacent rays and the base line are equal. In the illustration the equal blue circles define the spacing between the rays, as described.
The theorem states that the incircles of the triangles formed (starting from any given ray) by every other ray, every third ray, etc. and the base line are also equal.  The case of every other ray is illustrated above by the green circles, which are all equal.
From the fact that the theorem doesn't depend on the angle of the initial ray, it can be seen that the theorem properly belongs to analysis, rather than geometry, and must relate to a continuous scaling function which defines the spacing of the rays. In fact, this function is the hyperbolic sine.
The theorem is a direct corollary of the following lemma:

CATEGORIES: Ethnic cleansing, Circassians

The North Caucasus is the homeland of the Circassians. The region stretches along the high peaks of the Caucasian mountain range at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, bounded by Russia from the north and the Middle East from the south.
From 1763 to 1864 the Circassians fought against the Russians in the Russian-Circassian War only succumbing to a scorched earth campaign initiated in 1862 under General Yevdokimov.
On 2 June 1864 (21 May 1864 (O.S.)), the Russian Tsar Aleksandr II declared that the war has ended with the occupation of Circassian land. The Czar approved a decision to deport and exile the entire Circassian people.
In 1914, Nicholas II celebrated the 50th anniversary of the defeat of the Circassians as one of the empire's greatest victories. Boris Yeltsin, however, (when signing a peace treaty with Chechnya in the first Chechen War of Independence) acknowledged in 1996 that the war in the North Caucasus had lasted 400 years and was a tragedy.
In Soviet times, Joseph Stalin subdivided the remaining Circassians in the North Caucasus into a series of ethnic groups – the Adyghe (the self-designation of most Circassians), the Cherkess, the Kabardin, the Shapsugs, and several others – as extension of the classic divide-and-rule policy.
In 1990, the Circassians designated the 21st of May as the national Day of Mourning, on which they commemorate the tragedy of the nation.
More than 1.5 million Circassians were expelled — 90% of the total population at the time. Most of them perished en route, victims of disease, hunger, and exhaustion.
They were dispersed all over the world. Some traveled 3000 km on foot or on ox carts. Some roamed for 25 years before settling down. 
Today over 4 million Circassians live outside their homeland in over 40 countries across of the world. Many Circassians remember their ancestors who had survived the Circassian Genocide to suffer the miseries of the deportation.

Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients is a computer game developed by Angelsoft released by Mindscape in 1987, for the Apple II and PC DOS computer platforms.
Based on the Indiana Jones series, this is a text adventure game that is not based on any of the films; it is rather a whole new adventure, which in terms of the franchise's storyline, takes place in 1932. As in other text adventures, the player must type the action he wants to execute when prompted, in order to advance the storyline.
The storyline involves the eponymous character traveling to the Mexican jungle and explore the Tepotzteco Pyramid, with the purpose of getting the Mazatec Power Key before the Nazi forces, under the command of Plebinheim, get to it first.

CATEGORIES: 1923 births, 1997 deaths, Actresses from Wisconsin, Writers from Wisconsin, People from Menasha, Wisconsin, 20th-century American actresses

Connie Clausen (born Constance Clausen on June 11, 1923, in Menasha, Wisconsin, and died September 7, 1997, in New York City) was an actress, author, and literary agent.[tpl]cite news | date = September 14, 1997 | title = Connie Clausen, Literary Agent And Actress, 74 | work = The New York Times | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC1F39F937A2575AC0A961958260 [/tpl]
Connie Clausen's career began in 1942 at the age of 19 when she was approached by John Ringling North on Main Street in Sarasota, Florida (then the winter quarters for Ringling Brothers Circus), who told her that her long hair would make her a perfect "Alice in Wonderland" in the following season's "fairy tale" themed grand finale.  She joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and performed as an acrobat in an elephant act.[tpl]cite book | last = Taper | first = Bernard | year = 1996 | title = Balanchine: A Biography | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 0-520-20639-8 |pages = 181–182 [/tpl] Her experiences in the circus later provided material for her memoir "I Love You Honey, but the Season's Over" (Holt, Reinhart & Winston, 1961), in which she discussed, amongst other issues, the "significant gap" between what women did within the circus ring and their treatment outside of it.[tpl]cite book | last = Tait | first = Peta | year = 2005 | title = Circus Bodies: Cultural Identity in Aerial Performance | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-32938-8 |pages = 104 [/tpl]
After leaving the circus, she worked as a magazine and television writer and started with MGM studios in Hollywood as Director of Special Promotions.[tpl]cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Obituaries | journal = Publishers Weekly | volume = 244 | issue = 38 | pages = p. 17 [/tpl] Encouraged by an MGM studio photographer, she moved to New York to begin a career as a Conover Model and as a successful Broadway and television actress. She appeared on Broadway in "The Gambler" with Alfred Drake and appeared in hundreds of television shows and commercials in the 1950s and 1960s.  She was a television spokeswoman for Beech-nut Baby Foods and Westinghouse, and was a regular featured guest on "The Doctor Spock Show" with her twin sons.
In 1971 Connie Clausen began a new career in publishing. As an assistant Vice President of Macmillan, she helped launch two of the company's best sellers, "Watership Down" and "Jonathan Livingston Seagull".  In 1978 she started her own literary agency, Connie Clausen & Associates, which had a series of best sellers, including the beauty books by the photographerFrancesco Scavullo,[tpl]cite book | last = O'Boyle | first = Jane | year = 2001 | title = Cool Dead People | publisher = Penguin USA | isbn = 0-452-28229-2 [/tpl] the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga" by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, "Eat to Win", "The Rules" and many others.

[[Opaque travel inventory]]
CATEGORIES: Tourism

An opaque inventory is the market of selling unsold travel inventory at a discounted price. The inventory is called "opaque" because the specific supplier (i.e. hotel, airline, etc.) remain hidden until after the purchase has been completed. This is done to prevent sales of unsold inventory from cannibalizing full-price retail sales. According to TravelClick, the opaque channel accounted for 6% of all hotel reservations for major brands in 2012, up 2% from 2010.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.secrethotels.eu/secret-hotels-win-win-for-hotels-and-travellers/=all|title = Secret Hotels – Win Win for Hotels and Travellers|date= June 29, 2013|website=Secret Hotels Europe[/tpl]
The primary consumers of opaque inventories are price-conscious people whose primary aim is the cheapest travel possible and are less concerned with the specifics of their travel plans. Hotel discounts of 30-60% are typical, and bargains are stronger at a higher star hotel. While one has control over the dates and times of a travel itinerary, the downside is these purchases are absolutely non-refundable and non-changeable and, as noted above, the specific hotel or airline is not revealed until after purchase.
The main sources of opaque inventories are Hotwire.com and Priceline.com, but Travelocity.com and Expedia.com. Priceline functions with a bidding model, while Hotwire has a fixed pricing model, meaning it sells at a fixed price and travelers do not bid for inventory. Typically hotel deals are greater than airline discounts on opaque travel sites, namely because airlines have limited seating and also take monetary cuts when publishing discounted fares, whereas a hotel sells to opaque sites to fill empty rooms.
A newer website, GetGoing.com, is offering a twist to the opaque booking model - it asks consumers to pick two destinations, set travel dates and times to each destination, and it randomly picks one of the two destinations, offering a sizable discount.  The service doesn't reveal the airline until after the consumer has found out which destination they are flying to.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/travel/taking-some-mystery-out-of-blind-booking.html?pagewanted=all|title = Taking Some Mystery Out of Blind Booking|date = March 28, 2013|website = New York Times[/tpl]
In response to these opaque travel sites, there are also 'decoder' sites that use feedback from recent purchasers to help construct a profile of the opaque travel property.

[[Security level management]]

CATEGORIES: Data security

Security Level Management (SLM) comprises a quality assurance system for electronic information security. 
The aim of SLM is to display the IT security status transparently across a company at any time, and to make IT security a measurable quantity. Transparency and measurability form the prerequisites for making IT security proactively monitorable, so that it can be improved continuously.
SLM is oriented towards the phases of the Deming Cycle/Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle: within the scope of SLM, abstract security policies or compliance guidelines at a company are transposed into operative, measureable specifications for the IT security infrastructure. The operative aims form the security level to be reached. 
The security level is checked permanently against the current performance of the security systems (malware scanner, patch systems, etc.). Deviations can be recognised early on and adjustments made to the security system.
SLM falls under the range of duties of the Chief Security Officer (CSO), the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who report directly to the Executive Board on IT Security and data availability.

Somontano de Barbastro (Aragonese: Semontano de Balbastro) is a comarca in Province of Huesca, Aragon, Spain.
Somontano borders the counties of Sobrarbe and Alto Gállego to the north, Ribagorza and La Litera to the east, Cinca Medio to the southwest, the Monegros desert to the south and Hoya de Huesca to the west.
As its Latin name suggests, Somontano, meaning "beneath the mountain", lies at the foothills of the Pyrenees.  The area is abundantly irrigated by four important rivers which flow down from the north: the Alcanadre, Cinca, Ésera and the river Vero.
The primary economy of the county has always been agricultural and livestock farming based. Wheat and grains, as well as olives are the primary crops; however in recent years, its world renowned wine production which earned it a Denominación de origen title in 1984, has acquired great prestige for its quality. The city of Barbastro, home to about 85% of the county's population, is a regional hub for the food industry, construction and chemical industry.
The county is also home to the Sierra de Guara, a vast Open Space preserve with canyons and gorges and over 60 limestone caves with prehistoric cave paintings, which led UNESCO to declare it as a World Heritage Site in 1998.

[[Property premium]]
CATEGORIES: Property

Property premium is the key concept in the system of property-based economics developed by Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger, together with Hans-Joachim Stadermann. It is an insight derived from the legal distinction between property and possession, which although a commonplace to jurists is a concept hitherto unknown and thus unused by economists. 

The distinction between property and possession is used by Heinsohn and Steiger to classify forms of society. "Three distinctive systems of material reproduction are known to man: (i) custom or tribal societies, (ii) command or feudal societies and (iii) ownership- or property-based societies."Heinsohn and Steiger, Eigentum, Zins und Geld: Ungelöste Rätsel der Wirtshaftswissenschaft (Marburg: Metropolis-Verlag, 20064), p. 471 (abstract in English). The first two are based on possession, which is a physical, material concept. Property, on the other hand, is an abstract, intangible concept, and thus can only exist as a creation of law and within the realm established by the rule of law. Where such a regime of law is established, property arises; and it is accompanied by the phenomenon of property premium. "As soon as property is created it carries an unearned and immaterial premium, the property premium. This premium exists in addition to the physical use of goods or ressources [tpl]sic[/tpl] in their possessional state and consists of two powers: (i) its capacity of backing the issue of money which can be created only in a credit contract and (ii) its eligibility to serve as collateral for obtaining credit."ibid. 

It is this property premium which explains the phenomenon of interest. The owner gives up his property premium by using his property to back the issue of that money; what he gains in exchange is interest. The borrower likewise foregoes property premium in engaging a loan, because he must back his promise of repayment with collateral, pledging his property as security for repayment of the loan. What he receives in return is liquidity premium, which is the capacity to cancel indebtedness."The liquidity premium is a measure of a debtor's capacity to fulfil contracts, credit contracts and sales contracts alike. Money as the only asset to finally settle contracts, therefore, carries liquidity premium per se. Other assets which are not money, from demand deposits over marketable debt titles to capital assets, have a liquidity premium bequeathed to them by the very existence of money and according to their degree of transformability into money." ibid., p. 472. "Keynes's idea that interest is the payment for foregoing liquidity premium, therefore, falls short. The debtor's payment of interest materializes the creditor's property premium, while the debtor's property premium gives rise to liquidity premium."ibid., pp. 471-472.
This ingenious explanation for the existence of interest also demonstrates that interest is simply an aspect of property within the regime of private law. Within that regime it is inescapable; outside of it, in possession-oriented regimes whether tribal or communist, it is unobtainable.

CATEGORIES: Finnish television presenters, LGBT people from Finland, Living people, LGBT broadcasters

Mikko Silvennoinen is a Finnish television host, journalist and producer. At 18, he started as a host of the music programme Jyrki. He was one of the first well-known faces of the show.
After hosting Jyrki for one year, Silvennoinen left to study television in the United States where he did interviews and reports about the world of entertainment for Nelonen and the magazines Apu and Katso. He graduated from California State University in 2000 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications Studies and Broadcast Journalism. The following year, he brought the show Hollywood eXpress to Nelonen.
After returning from his studies, Silvennoinen continued to work at Nelonen, working on both sides of the camera. His most significant work on television is considered to be the show 4POP which he both edited and hosted from 2003 to 2004. The show was a weekly programme of pop culture.
Silvennoinen’s newest show, however, was not a success. The talk show Kuka, mitä, häh?, which was placed in the Thursday night time slot of the ambitiously legendary Hyvät, pahat ja rumat show, was cancelled only after a few episodes in spring 2007. Silvennoinen himself hosted the show along with five regular guests, and also a few special guests.
As a television producer, Silvennoinen was honored with the job of producing the popular Hauskat kotivideot, which shows videos from America's Funniest Home Videos. The show is hosted by Sampo Marjomaa.
Silvennoinen has openly spoken about his homosexuality. He has written columns for the gay magazine Voltti (formerly Z-lehti) and worked as a member of the Seta board from 2005 to 2006. The magazine City voted him as the city’s best gay celebrity.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Kaupungin+paras+2004/1324/ |title=Kaupungin paras 2004 |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |periodical=City [/tpl]

[[Orthoferrite]]

CATEGORIES: Iron compounds

An orthoferrite is any of a class of chemical compounds with the formula RFeO[tpl]sub|3[/tpl] (where R is one or more rare-earth elements).  Orthoferrites have an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm and most are weakly ferromagnetic."orthoferrite", Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision March 2008
At the Néel temperature TN the subsystem of iron ions orders into a slightly canted antiferromagnetic structure with antiferromagnetic moment G and a weak ferromagnetic moment F. The rare-earth ion subsystem acquires magnetization m due to an interaction with the iron subsystem.
The orthoferrites are particularly interesting because of the presence of an antisymmetric exchange interaction which involves the vector cross product of neighboring spins as opposed to the usual scalar product. In the absence of this interaction, the orthoferrites would be antiferromagnetic. Its presence leads to a small canting of the sublattices, making the orthoferrites “weak” ferromagnets with 4πMs = 100 G. Another interesting feature of these materials is the fact that some of them exhibit a transition as a function of temperature, in which the direction of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins and consequently also of the net magnetization rotates by 90°.

The season began on 30 July 1999 and ended on 4 June 1999. Mamelodi Sundowns once again managed to secure their crown, sealing their third successive PSL title. Along with their success in the PSL's predecessor - winning three National Soccer League titles in 1988, 1990 and 1993 - this gave Mamelodi Sundowns their 6th South African championship. Sundowns tallied 75 points for the season, equalling the points record they jointly set with Kaizer Chiefs last season, but unlike the previous season in which the title was decided by goal difference, there was no close title race this season as Sundowns finished comfortably ahead of second placed Orlando Pirates with an 11 point margin.
As before, the league was contested by 18 teams, sixteen returning from the 1997-98 season and two newly promoted clubs; the returning African Wanderers and Tembisa Classic. The league continued to run parallel to the European football calendar (August - May) and not run concurrently with the African football calendar (January - December).

The 1998–99 Premier Soccer League, known as the 1998-99 Castle Premiership for sponsorship purposes, was the third season of the Premier Soccer League since its establishment in 1996. The season began on 31 July 1998 and ended on 9 June 1999. Mamelodi Sundowns became the first team in PSL history to defend their title as they won their second straight PSL title and their fifth South African title after previously winning the PSL's predecessor - the National Soccer League - on three occasions (1988, 1990 and 1993). In a hotly contested title race between Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs it came down to goal difference to separate the two as both finished on a joint record 75 points. A margin of +5 in goal difference was all that separated the two teams as Sundowns won their second in what would be a hat-trick of PSL titles.
As before, the league was contested by 18 teams, sixteen returning from the 1997-98 season and two newly promoted clubs; Dynamos and Seven Stars. The league would also continue to run parallel to the European football calendar (August - May) and not run concurrently with the African football calendar (January - December).

[[Departure resistance]]

CATEGORIES: Aerospace engineering, Aviation safety

Departure resistance is a quality of an aircraft which enables it to remain in controlled flight and resist entering potentially dangerous less-controlled maneuvers such as spin.
Depending on its design, an aircraft may be more or less likely to leave (depart from) controlled flight when the pilot applies extreme control inputs. Good departure resistance characteristics allow the pilot to remain in control of the aircraft in such situations.
Departure resistance is considered to contribute more towards flight safety than departure recovery.Cirrus Design SR 20 Equivalent of safety for Spin requirement Departure recovery is the ability of an aircraft to return to controlled flight once in a certain uncontrolled maneuver. Being able to recover from spin is an example of departure recovery.

Lidia Masterkova (Lydia Masterkova) ([tpl]lang-ru|Лидия Мастеркова[/tpl], 1927, Moscow, USSR – May 12, 2008, Saint Laurent, France) was a Russian-born French painter, and part of the non-conformist Lianozovo Group along with Oscar Rabin.[tpl]cite web|title=Death of Lidiya Masterkova|url=http://artinvestment.ru/news/artnews/20080513_Masterkova_died.html|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]  She was strongly influenced by Abstract Expressionism, which she was exposed to at the exhibition of foreign artists held during the World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow (1957).[tpl]cite web|title=Lydia Masterkova|url=http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/20th-century/modern/nonconformist/generation-of-sixties/lydia-masterkova|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl]  
Masterkova studied under Mikhail Perutski at the Moscow Secondary School of Art (1943–46), the Vasily Surikov School of Art (1946) and Moscow Regional School of Art (1947–50). A dedicated abstractionist, Masterkova was associated with the Lianozovo Circle, a diverse group of artists and poets who fought steadfastly and uncompromisingly for creative freedom. One of these artists, Vladimir Nemukhin, lived with her, although they never married.
One of the significant personalities in the Moscow art world of the 1960s, Masterkova’s work at the beginning of that decade included loosely painted watercolors in bright colors. Soon after, she darkened her palette and in the mid 1960s, her work was characterized by abstract compositions created with a palette knife in which dark, craggy forms contrasted with a light background. By the end of the decade, she began incorporating lace and brocade collected from abandoned churches into her compositions. She felt these items were filled with a kind of mysticism.[tpl]cite web|title=Lydia Masterkova|url=http://www.gallerykino.ru/artists.php?id=11[/tpl] 
In the early 1970s, these dark, brooding forms were still in evidence, but superimposed by collages of white circles bearing the numerals 0, 1, and 9. She also created subtle, circular, black and white compositions by manipulating India ink or watercolor on wet paper, often affixing collage elements cut out of white paper.
During this period, Masterkova contributed to apartment exhibitions in Russia, foreign exhibitions, and the first shows of nonconformist art, including the first autumnal review, "In the open air" ("Bulldozer Exhibition") in 1974 in Belyaevo. Shortly afterwards, in 1975, she moved with her son to France, where she worked with the Galerie Dina Vierny in Paris (1976) and held a one-woman show called Adieu à la Russie (1977).
Lydia Masterkova tended to work in cycles and series, the most famous of which is "Planets" (1976). Her work resides in numerous museums and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Zimmerli Art Museum in New Jersey, and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, which held a retrospective of her work in 2006.
She died in 2008 at the age of 81 and was buried in Saint-Laurent-sur-Othain in Lorraine.

Hinton Priory was one of the ten medieval Carthusian houses (charterhouses) in England. It was first established at Hatherop in 1222 by William Longspee, Earl of Salisbury. The monks disliked the location, and on Longspee's death in 1226 they petitioned his countess for a new site to achieve greater solitude. She gave them her manors of Hinton and Norton St Philip in Somerset and the new house was consecrated at Hinton Charterhouse in May 1232. It was called Locus Dei meaning 'God's Place'.
The house was suppressed as part of the dissolution of the monasteries on 31 March 1539, and then bought by Matthew Colthurst.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Famous houses of the West Country|year=1977|publisher=Kingsmead Press|location=Bath|isbn=978-0-901571-87-8|pages=40–43[/tpl]

Kenneth was Cash's nephew-in-law. Cash's second wife, June Carter Cash, was Helen's sister.  Kenneth, or Kenny as he was also known, wrote many songs and was a talented musician.  At the time of his death he was under contract with Monument Records and appeared destined for a highly successful career.  Following his death the Carter Family recorded one of his songs, 2001 Ballad to the Future.  A few have noted the lyrics as being eerily prophetic of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States which took place more than thirty years after the song was written.
During the introduction to "Sing A Traveling Song" on the Johnny Cash at Madison Square Garden album, Cash says, "One of the songs in the new album Hello, I'm Johnny Cash was written by a young man, 15 years old [tpl]sic[/tpl], Kenny Jones, who was the son of Helen Carter. We do this song tonight as a tribute to Kenny Jones who was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 16.

United States Department of the Navy's Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) provides indications and warning for a wide range of threats to Navy and Marine Corps personnel and assets around the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncis.navy.mil/mission/mtac.asp |title=Multiple Threat Alert Center (MTAC) |accessdate=24 March 2012 |publisher=Naval Criminal Investigative Service |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100715192132/http://www.ncis.navy.mil/mission/mtac.asp |archivedate=15 July 2010 [/tpl]
The MTAC is at the NCIS HQ's located Russell-Knox Building, 27130 Telegraph Road Quantico, VA 22134.
Operated by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the MTAC utilizes NCIS' worldwide presence and combination of law enforcement, counterintelligence, intelligence and security capabilities to identify all available threat indicators. Analysts, special agents, and military personnel work in the MTAC around the clock to produce indications and warning of possible terrorist activity, foreign intelligence threats and criminal threats that may affect naval operations.
The MTAC is an outgrowth of the Navy Antiterrorist Alert Center (ATAC). The ATAC was established in December 1983 to address the terrorist threat after the bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, and the murders of Navy officers in Greece by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November and in El Salvador by the FMLN.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/terrorism/1989-1980/index.html |title=Terrorism Timeline from 1989 - 1980 |date=28 December 2011 |work=Timeline of Terrorism |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl] As the first 24-hour terrorism watch center in the U.S. Intelligence Community, the ATAC successfully supported the Navy and Marine Corps team for nearly two decades.
The MTAC epitomizes the multi-faceted nature of the NCIS mission by linking terrorism, counterintelligence, intelligence, cyber, criminal, and security information. The MTAC is a unique platform in that it merges intelligence from other agencies with information from NCIS source networks and law enforcement activities worldwide to provide the most relevant operational support to Navy and Marine Corps commanders.

PAS 55 - Optimal management of physical assets was a Publicly Available Specification published by the British Standards Institution.  It has been superseded by ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/Asset-Management/ | title=ISO 55001:2014 Asset Management | publisher=BSI Group | accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref1813 | title=Asset management system standards published | publisher=ISO | work=News | date=23 January 2014 | accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]
This PAS gives guidance and a 28-point requirements checklist of good practices in physical asset management; typically this is relevant to gas, electricity and water utilities, road, air and rail transport systems, public facilities, process, manufacturing and natural resource industries. It is equally applicable to public and private sector, regulated or non-regulated environments. PAS 55 is getting a lot of interest and shows promise to become a defacto world-wide specification for any organizations seeking to demonstrate a high level of professionalism in whole life cycle management of their physical assets.  
The standard is split into two parts:
It is also accompanied by a comprehensive Competencies Framework for asset managers.
The standard was originally produced in 2004 by a number of organizations under the leadership of the Institute of Asset Management. It has recently undergone a substantial revision with 50 participating organisations from 15 industry sectors in 10 countries. PAS 55:2008 was released in Dec 2008 along with a toolkit for self-assessment against the specification.  PAS 55:2008 is available in both English and Spanish versions http://www.theiam.org/en/products_services/bsipas55-2008.
The Institute of Asset Management has developed endorsement schemes for recommending competent assessors and training providers.  Presently only a small number of expert organizations have demonstrated the required knowledge, experience and standards required to be endorsed as PAS 55 assessors Endorsed PAS55 assessors or asset management training providers IAM Endorsed AM trainers.

[[Ushnishasitatapattra]]
CATEGORIES: Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist deities, bodhisattvas, and demons, Buddhism and women

Thousand-Armed Ushnishasitatapattra is a special form of the goddess Tara (Buddhism), a female form of the thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara. Her iconography is probably the most complex in the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon. The goddess has as many heads and legs as she has arms. She tramples on both human beings and animals. Pressed under her feet, they symbolize egocentric existence, while the function of her umbrella is to protect all beings from all fears.
Ushnishasitatapattra is a powerful independent deity. She manifests this power with her thousand faces, thousand arms and thousand legs. Each face has three eyes, and the palm and wrist of each hand has its own eyes. In this detailed painting she displays them all in multiple rows, including a tall stack of heads in four different colors. Her impressive and awesome appearance is bolstered by her vigorous posture, emphasized by her wide billowing brocaded tent-like skirts and long, twisting, green scarves. Her slightly fierce mien does not outweigh the expressions of her lovely and benign nature - the beauty of her form, her white color, and the refinement of her small round face and tiny, idealized features.
Ushnishasitatapattra is popular with the Geluk order in particular. She is often given a prominent position among the wall paintings in Gelukpa monasteries, such as Drepung in Lhasa.

Silvio Berlusconi himself, leader of Forza Italia, proposed the foundation of the Circles of Freedom during the annual meeting of Communion and Liberation in Rimini in August 2006.
The goal of the Circles was to build a political-cultural group of citizens who want to take part to the national political life by starting from local issues, such as city administration, and to build a united centre-right party in Italy. That goal was eventually reached with the foundation of The People of Freedom (PdL) between November 2007 and March 2009 and the Circles of Freedom were among the official founding members of the new party.
Within the PdL, the Circles are still active, but they became part of the larger Promoters of Freedom organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/25/Brambilla_Promotori_della_Liberta_co_8_100225024.shtml |title=La Brambilla e i Promotori della Libertà |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/25/Berlusconi_attacca_intercettazioni_barbare_Stato_co_8_100225022.shtml |title=Berlusconi attacca: intercettazioni barbare da Stato di polizia |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/26/premier_scendete_campo_con_me_co_8_100226036.shtml |title=Il premier: scendete in campo con me |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl]

The fortress was battle-tested in 1915 when Germany attacked the Russian Empire, and withstood eleven days of assault before capture.

It was used by various civil institutions and as a garrison.[tpl]Harvnb|Orlov|2007|p=12[/tpl]
During World War II, parts of the fortress complex were used by the governments of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union for detention, interrogation, and execution.

Thomas Jefferson Withers (1804 – November 7, 1865) was a Confederate politician from South Carolina who served in the Confederate States Congress during the American Civil War.
Withers was born in York County, South Carolina, and served as a state court judge in 1846. He represented the state in the Provisional Confederate Congress in 1861 and signed the Confederate States Constitution.
Withers is also notable for the sexually explicit letters he wrote in 1826 to a college friend, future governor James Henry Hammond, with whom Withers had a homosexual relationship.  The letters, which are housed among the Hammond Papers at the South Caroliniana Library, were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981, and are remarkable for being rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the antebellum United States.Duberman, Martin Bauml.

Charade is the thirteenth studio album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in late 1995 on WEA/Warner Music.
After a three-year-long artistic and legal dispute with her label EMI Music Alice signed with WEA in 1995 and then released her first studio album since 1992's Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi, the both musically and lyrically introspective and contemplative Charade featuring contributions from musicians such as King Crimson's Trey Gunn, several tracks with British improvisational solo violinist Stuart Gordon  and acoustic tracks with the American/Belgian/Japanese California Guitar Trio. Charade further developed the use of minimalist ambient/avant-garde backgrounds, fractured guitars and woodwind, muted trumpets and accordion set against programmed TR-808 rhythms, influenced by dance music genres like electronica and contemporary R&B, fused with world music samples and looped vocals.
Lead single "Dammi la mano amore" was also included as an ambient dub mix on the album, entitled Devogue version, and the second edition of Charade added an R&B influenced remix as a bonus track. "In piedi su uno specchio" was later to reappear as part of a collaborative crossover/ambient/fusion project called Devogue, a forty-five minute sound collage which featured Alice, producer Francesco Messina, Porcupine Tree's Gavin Harrison and composer and singer Juri Camisasca among others, released on the independent label CNI in 1997. Alice sings lead vocals on five of the album's thirteen titles; "Midnight Bells", "In piedi su uno specchio", "Le condizioni del tempo (a.m.)", "Palmenhaus" and "Il cielo sopra il cielo", the latter which would appear on the album Exit the following year.
Both "Dammi la mano amore" and the second single "Non ero mai sola" were later to be included in the 2000 career retrospective Personal Jukebox.

Of Time and the City is a 2008 documentary collage film directed by Terence Davies.
The film has Davies recalling his life growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s and 1960s, using newsreel and documentary footage supplemented by his own commentary voiceover and contemporaneous and classical music soundtracks.
The film premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival where it received rave reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/05/21/liverpool-film-portrait-takes-cannes-film-festival-by-storm-64375-20940233/|title=Liverpool film portrait takes Cannes film festival by storm|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=21 May 2008[/tpl] Time Out said "The one truly great movie to emerge so far (from Cannes)..... this film is as personal, as universal in its relevance, and as gloriously cinematic as anything he has done" and The Guardian called it "a British masterpiece, a brilliant assemblage of images that illuminate our past. Not only does it tug the heart-strings but it's also savagely funny." BBC TV film critic Mark Kermode nominated it as the best overall film of 2008 on his "Kermode Awards" section of The Culture Show, and Duane Byrge from The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as "poetically composed" and a "masterwork".[ref]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Israel

Highway 57 is an east-west highway through central Israel and the West Bank. In the past, it was an uninterrupted road from Netanya, a city on the Mediterranean coast in the west, to Damia Bridge across the Jordan River in the east.  The road existed in its full length from the time of the British Mandate, and parts of it are even older. Today the road is separated into three unconnected parts: the first from Netanya to Nitzanei Oz interchange at Highway 6, the second from there to an Israel Defense Forces checkpoint in Beka'ot in the northeastern West Bank, and the third from there until Damia Bridge. The middle portion of the road between Nitzanei Oz and Beka'ot passes through Tulkarm and Nablus, and most of it is located in Area A and Area B controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Various restrictions on traffic exist in these areas.

The Planta Solar 20 (PS20)  solar power plant is a solar thermal energy plant in Sanlucar la Mayor near Seville in Andalusia, Spain. It was the world's most powerful solar power tower until the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California became operational in 2014.Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, Wikipedia The 20 megawatt (MW) solar power tower produces electricity with large movable mirrors called heliostats.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2007/2007-03-30-02.asp |title= First EU Commercial Concentrating Solar Power Tower Opens in Spain |date= 30 March 2007 |publisher= Environment News Service |accessdate= 20 March 2012 [/tpl]Abengoa Solar Begins Operation of World's Largest Solar Power Tower Plant
Construction of PS20 was started in 2006 and it commenced operation in 2009. It features several significant technological improvements over the earlier PS10. These include a receiver with higher efficiency, various improvements in the control and operational systems, and a better thermal energy storage system.
"PS20 consists of a solar field of 1,255 mirrored heliostats designed by Abengoa Solar. Each heliostat, with a surface area of [tpl]Convert|120|m2|ft2|abbr=on[/tpl], reflects the solar radiation it receives onto the receiver, located on the top of a [tpl]Convert|165|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high tower, producing steam which is converted into electricity by a turbine generator."[ref]
</ref>
"The remaining power plants will be built over the next few years. They will include low- and high-concentration photovoltaic, tower thermoelectric, parabolic-trough collector and Stirling dish plants. Abengoa Solar's parabolic trough plants, Solnova 1, 3 and 4, which can generate 150MW of power, are under construction at the Solar Platform."[ref]
</ref>
Resulting from cooperation between Ciemat, the IDEA, and the University of Seville, the whole plant is to be completed by 2013, when it will produce approximately 300 MW – energy for around 180,000 homes, equivalent to the needs of the city of Seville.
PS20 produces about 48,000 megawatt-hours (MW·h) per year, for which it receives €271 (US$360) per MW·h under its power purchase agreement.[ref]

[[Reggae rock]]

CATEGORIES: Fusion music genres, Reggae genres, Rock music genres

Reggae rock is a subgenre of reggae fusion that primarily uses the genres reggae, rock and ska. The term "reggae rock" has been used to categorize bands like Sublime, Sublime with Rome, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, The Expendables, Iration, The Dirty Heads, Rebelution, 311 and, to some extent, heavier bands such as Fishbone and Bad Brains. The somewhat related term "ragga metal" has been used to describe bands that combine metal and ragga, such as Dub War, Skindred and Zeroscape. Reggae rock found its rise in popularity in the 1990s in Long Beach, California, with the band Sublime. The genre has lately found a boost in popularity with the 2010 song "Lay Me Down" by The Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez from Sublime with Rome, which peaked at number 1 on both the US Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/300985/dirty+heads/chart?f=377 |title= Dirty Heads – Alternative Songs Chart History |work= Billboard |publisher= Prometheus Global Media |accessdate= 17 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=  Dirty Heads – Rock Songs Chart History |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/300985/dirty+heads/chart?f=902 |work= Billboard |publisher= Prometheus Global Media |accessdate= 17 February 2013[/tpl]

[[C space]]
CATEGORIES: Banach spaces, Functional analysis

In the mathematical field of functional analysis, the space denoted by c is the vector space of all convergent sequences (xn) of real numbers or complex numbers.  When equipped with the uniform norm:
the space c becomes a Banach space.  It is a closed linear subspace of the space of bounded sequences, ℓ∞, and contains as a closed subspace the Banach space c0 of sequences converging to zero.  The dual of c is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ1, as is that of c0. In particular, neither c nor c0 is reflexive.
In the first case, the isomorphism of ℓ1 with c* is given as follows.  If (x0,x1,...) ∈ ℓ1, then the pairing with an element (y1,y2,...) in c is given by
This is the Riesz representation theorem on the ordinal ω.
For c0, the pairing between (xi) in ℓ1 and (yi) in c0 is given by

Vitreography is a fine art printmaking technique that uses a [tpl]convert|3/8|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] float glass matrix instead of the traditional matrices of metal, wood or stone. A print created using the technique is called a vitreograph. Unlike a monotype, in which ink is painted onto a smooth glass plate and transferred to paper to produce a unique work, the vitreograph technique involves fixing the imagery in, or on, the glass plate. This allows the production of an edition of prints.

Dursun Karataş (March 25, 1952,[tpl]ref|birth|¶[/tpl] Elazığ—August 11, 2008, Netherlands) was the founding leader of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) in Turkey.
Karataş founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C) in 1978,Chasdi, Richard J. Tapestry of terror : a portrait of Middle East terrorism, 1994-1999.

Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. In prison Karataş wrote "Haklıyız Kazanacağız" ("We Are Right, We Shall Prevail"); a work which included an analysis of the movement's mistakes, and a list of the organization's enemies. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.Alexander, Yonah/Pluchinsky Alexander, Dennis A. Europe's red terrorists: Fighting communist organizations. London: Cass, 1992. p. 39-40
He escaped from prison in 1989. In 1989-1990, Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992, his wife Sabahat was killed by the Turkish police.
Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.Kushner, Harvey W. Encyclopedia of Terrorism. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2003. p. 315
On September 9, 1994, he was arrested at the Franco-Italian border, and sentenced to four years in prison. In 2006 a Belgian court sentenced him in absentia.
The Ankara 9th administrative court ruled in February 2007 that Turkey should pay an YTL 1,000 compensation to Karataş, who was tried in absentia for 27 years, for membership in an outlawed organization and the unauthorized possession of guns and fake documents. The judges' decision stated that: "The Karataş trial process started at the Ordu Martial Law Court in 1981 and has not been concluded since then. We have decided that Turkey should pay compensation to Karataş for such a lengthy trial process."

Bochicidae is a family of pseudoscorpions distributed throughout the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico with one species found as far north as Texas. Members of the family can be diagnosed mainly by features of the claws, notably the presence of exactly 12 trichobothria on each claw (members of other similar families possess many more) and a long, as opposed to short, venom duct. Some species live in caves while some are surface-dwelling.
Muchmore (1998) includes the genera Paravachonium and Vachonium in this family but many authors place these in a separate family, Vachoniidae.

[[Pseudo-order]]

CATEGORIES: Constructivism (mathematics), Order theory

In constructive mathematics, a pseudo-order is a constructive generalisation of a linear order to the continuous case. The usual trichotomy law does not hold in the constructive continuum because of its indecomposability, so this condition is weakened. 
A pseudo-order is a binary relation satisfying the following conditions:
This first condition is simply antisymmetry. It follows from the first two conditions that a pseudo-order is transitive. The second condition is often called co-transitivity or comparison and is the constructive substitute for trichotomy. In general, given two elements of a pseudo-ordered set, it is not always the case that either one is less than the other or else they are equal, but given any nontrivial interval, any element is either above the lower bound, or below the upper bound.
The third condition is often taken as the definition of equality. The natural apartness relation on a pseudo-ordered set is given by
and equality is defined by the negation of apartness.
The negation of the pseudo-order is a partial order which is close to a total order: if x ≤ y is defined as the negation of y Using classical logic one would then conclude that x ≤ y or y ≤ x, so it would be a total order. However, this inference is not valid in the constructive case.
The prototypical pseudo-order is that of the real numbers: one real number is less than another if there exists (one can construct) a rational number greater than the former and less than the latter. In other words, x

Charles Crupelandt (23 October 1886, Wattrelos, Nord - 18 February 1955, Roubaix) was a French professional road bicycle racer. He won stages in the Tour de France, but his biggest successes were the 1912 and 1914 Paris–Roubaix. The last cobbled section (300m) of the race, just before the velodrome, is named Espace Charles Crupelandt.
In 1912 Charles Crupelandt became the subject of a painting by the Cubist artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. Au Vélodrome, also known as At the Cycle-Race Track and Le cycliste, illustrates the final meters of the Paris–Roubaix race and portrays its 1912 winner.Cycling, Cubo‐Futurism and the 4th Dimension. Jean Metzinger’s“At the Cycle‐Race Track”, Curated by Erasmus Weddigen, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, June 9 – September 16, 2012 Metzinger’s painting was the first in Modernist art to represent a specific sporting event and its champion. He incorporated into the painting his concepts of multiple perspective, simultaneity, and time, according to his belief that the fourth dimension was crucial to the new art that could compete with the classical French tradition. The painting was acquired by Peggy Guggenheim in 1945 and is now permanently on view in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection museum in Venice.The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, Jean Metzinger, At the Cycle‐Race Track
Crupelandt went to war and returned a hero, with the Croix de Guerre. Three years into peace, however, he fell foul of the law and was found guilty. The Union Vélocipédique banned him for life, possibly at the urging of rivals in cycling.http://www.ville-wattrelos.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=134&Itemid=298
Crupelandt raced again but with an unofficial cycling association, with which he won national championships in 1922 and 1923. He died in 1955, blind and with both legs amputated.

[tpl]About|the blues song||Trouble in Mind (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Trouble in Mind[/tpl]

"Trouble in Mind" is a slow eight-bar blues song written by jazz pianist Richard M. Jones.  The song was recorded in 1924 by singer Thelma La Vizzo with Jones providing the piano accompaniment.  The song became an early blues standard, with versions by Bertha "Chippie" Hill with Louis Armstrong on cornet and Jones on piano (1926 OKeh 8312), Georgia White (1936 Decca 7192), Victoria Spivey (as Jane Lucas) (1936 Vocalion 3346), and Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys (1936 Vocalion 3343).  Later, "Trouble in Mind" was a Billboard R&B chart hit for Dinah Washington (#4 in 1952) and Nina Simone (#11 in 1961 and #92 in the pop chart).
In many versions of "Trouble in Mind", several new verses are added.[ref]Bob Dylan's 1979 B-side to "Gotta Serve Somebody" has different lyrics.

Jeyes Fluid is a brand of disinfectant fluid made by Jeyes Group Ltd. in Thetford, Norfolk, England. It is for outdoor use only.Product fact sheet 
Patented by John Jeyes in 1877 the product was granted a Royal Warrant to the British Royal Family in 1896, and continues to supply the Royal household to this day. 
Jeyes Group had an exclusive licence to sell the following brands into the UK professional cleaning market until it sold the professional division to Selden Research Ltd:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeyesprofessional.co.uk/Colgate-Palmolive/View-all-products.html |title=Exclusive Licence: Ajax, Palmolive[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jeyesprofessional.co.uk/Cussons/View-all-products.html |title=Exclusive Licence: Carex, Imperial Leather[/tpl]
Historically Jeyes Fluid has also been used in medical treatments, as quoted by Dr. William Robert Woodman in the British Medical Journal (1888, Vol 2):[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clickcleaning.co.uk/cleaning-guides-tips/22/the-history-of-jeyes-fluid-.aspx |title= The History of Jeyes Fluid[/tpl] 
 Dr. Woodman drew special attention to the scarlet fever cases treated in hospital, and pointed out that the whole of the deaths among them occurred in 1877. From 1877 to December 31st 1887, 241 cases of scarlet fever were treated by the medical officers at the sanatorium without a death."[tpl]cite journal|pmc=2197732 |title= The British Medical Journal, 1888 vol 2 | pmid=20752390 | volume=2 |issue=1439 |date=July 1888 |journal=Br Med J |pages=173–4[/tpl] 
Since 1877 Dr. Woodman's patients were given frequent warm baths with some Jeyes' Fluid added. This proved significant in the treatment of scarlet fever and the prevention of dropsy, which usually followed.
For the first time in its 130 years, Jeyes Fluid appeared on television screens with a £500,000 advertising campaign that was aired in the UK over the Easter bank holiday in 2011. This campaign was to widen the appeal of the brand, remind consumers of its versatility, and introduce the product to a new generation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tribepr.com/News-views/News/April-2011/Jeyes-Fluid-makes-TV-debut.aspx |title= Jeyes Fluid makes TV debut[/tpl]
The product is pronounced as "Jays" Fluid.

[[Variations of golf]]

CATEGORIES: Forms of golf

Variations of golf are games or activities based on or similar to the game of golf, in which the player utilizes common golf skills.  Some are essentially identical to golf, with only minor rules changes, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games.  Other variations include contests or activities intended to help the player practice or reinforce skills, which may or may not have a competitive aspect.  Most of the variations are played in non-professional settings, without the presence of officials and sometimes without strict adherence to official game rules.  Some of the variations were created to level the playing field for players of varying skill levels to be able to compete.  Often, the rules are in place to provide a structure for side-betting that is independent of the final "traditional" score.

Muscatatuck County Park, formerly known as Vinegar Mills State Park and Muscatatuck State Park, is a recreational park located by the town of Vernon, Indiana in Jennings County.
Formally opened on May 17, 1921, on land given by Jennings County to the Indiana state government, Vinegar Mills State Park was established as an [tpl]convert|86|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] park. It was named for an old mill used to cut stone during the pioneer days along the Muscatatuck River. The name was soon changed to Muscatatuck State Park, to reflect the historical Indian name given the River, believed to mean "winding waters".  Aside from a small inn built from a brick house known as the William Read Home, which acted as a bed and breakfast, and wood-floored tents, the property was seldom improved upon; it remained a highly forested area popular with travelers between Madison, Indiana and Indianapolis. While a state park, it was the first to require no financial assistance from the state government, even though it never charged admission and the founder of the Indiana state park system, Richard Lieber, strongly believed in doing so.  However, during the Great Depression both the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made slight improvements to the property, mostly road work and a fire tower.DNR: DNR Historical Timeline History
Muscatatuck would eventually be redesignated as a state game farm in 1956, concentrating on raising quail and pheasant. In 1962 it had the first youth camp in Indiana meant for the general public, and not for convicted youth. In 1968 the land was returned to Jennings County, which to this day has made it a county park. Although it lagged for twenty years by lack in funds, by the 1990s it saw an increase in funds, endowments, and community interest. 
Mountain biking is available in the park.Muscatatuck Park Mountain Biking Trails in North Vernon, Indiana
Muscatatuck County Park should not be confused with nearby Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge.

[[Non-status Indian]]
CATEGORIES: First Nations history

In Canada, a Non-Status Indian is a legal term referring to any First Nations individual who for whatever reason is not registered with the Federal government, and/or is not registered to a band which signed a Treaty with the Crown.
For several decades, Canadian First Nations women automatically became non-status if they married non-First Nations men.
Prior to 1955, a status Indian may lose their status and become non-status through enfranchisement (voluntarily giving up status, usually for a minimal cash payment), by obtaining a college degree or becoming an ordained minister.
The 2013 Federal Court case Daniels v. Canada established that non-Status Indians (and Métis) have the same Aboriginal rights as status people, in that they are encompassed in the 1867 constitution's language about "Indians".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Court+decision+ends+ambiguity+status+Indians+Metis+officially+Indians/7789924/story.html |title= Court decision ends ambiguity for non-status Indians and Metis, now officially 'Indians' |first= Kim |last= Pemberton |work= Vancouver Sun |date= January 8, 2013[/tpl]

Hendrik (Henno) Mentz born 25 September 1979 in Ermelo, Mpumalanga, South Africa is a rugby union player for the Lions in the Super Rugby competition. He plays on the wing. Since his transition from the Sharks to the Lions in 2009, Mentz has been a consistently good player in an overall poor Lions team. Mentz's most notable achievement being his hat trick score against the Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. This was a large contribution to the 31-20 victory that the Lions achieved against the Reds.
In the early days of his Super rugby career, Mentz set the competition (at the time, the Super12) alight, however Mentz followed this with a poor Currie Cup. Mentz's career took a further hit when he suffered a hamstring injury which put him out of contention for the 2005 Sharks Super 12 squad.
Mentz was capped twice by South Africa in 2004. He played against Ireland in Bloemfontein and his second and final test was in Pretoria against Wales. In 2005 Mentz was the ABSA Currie Cups' leading try-scorer crossing the whitewash 13 times for the Sharks. Henno Mentz's brother, MJ Mentz is an experienced SA Sevens representative and currently plies his trade with the Pumas. Henno Mentz scored an impressive 72 tries in 149 first-class matches, of which he scored 31 of those in 65 provincial matches for Natal.

CATEGORIES: Western swing songs, 1921 songs, 1984 singles, Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles, George Strait songs, Songs with lyrics by Haven Gillespie, Song recordings produced by Ray Baker (music producer), RPM Country Tracks number-one singles, MCA Records singles

"Right or Wrong" is a jazz ballad from 1921. Composed by Arthur Sizemore and Paul Biese, with words by Haven Gillespie, it is described by the original sheet music as "a beautiful fox-trot ballad."Gillespie, "Right or Wrong", p. 6. 
The lyrics tell of the loss of a paramour. The title comes from a refrain in the chorus:
"Right or Wrong" was recorded by many early jazz and swing orchestras, including; Mike Markel and His Orchestra (OKeh 4478, 1921), Original Dixie Jazz Band (Oriole 445, 1925), Peggy English (Brunswick 3949, 1928), Tampa Red (Bluebird 6832, 1936), and Mildred Bailey and Her Orchestra (Vocalion 3758, 1937). The recording with the longest lasting influence would be the one by the black-faced Emmett Miller and the Georgia Crackers (OKeh 41280, 1929). 
Miller's version was picked up by an early Bob Wills and became a standard Western swing dance tune.Stambler, Country Music, p. 311: "A notebook kept by Bob Wills in 1931, when he was doing a radio program in an early phase of his career in Texas with Herman Arnspringer, listed songs drawn from Emmett Miller's repertoire: 'Right or wrong,' 'Big Bad Bill, 'Blues Singer from Alabam,' 'I Ain't got Nobody,' and 'Lovin' Sam'. " Both Wills (Vocalion 03451, 1936) and Milton Brown (Decca 5342, 1936) made early recordings. Western swing versions generally do not include any of the verses, only repetitions of the chorus. The song also appears on Leon Redbone's 1990 album Sugar.
Wanda Jackson's hit "Right or Wrong" in 1961 is not this song, but one written by herself.

Don Giovanni Tenorio, o sia Il convitato di pietra"Don Giovanni (i)" by Mary Hunter, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed. Stanley Sadie [tpl]Subscription[/tpl] gives: Don Giovanni, o sia Il convitato di pietra and Don Giovanni Tenorio (English: Don Giovanni Tenorio, or The Stone Guest) is the most famous opera by the Italian composer Giuseppe Gazzaniga. It belongs to the genre of dramma giocoso and is in one act. Don Giovanni Tenorio was first performed at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice, on February 5, 1787. The libretto, by Giovanni Bertati, is based on the legend of Don Juan, leading to comparisons with Mozart's Don Giovanni, which had its premiere later in 1787. Mozart's librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, certainly knew the earlier opera. Gazzaniga's work is much shorter than Mozart's, however, and originally formed part of a double-bill with another piece, Il capriccio drammatico.

General elections were held in Malaya on 27 July 1955, the only general elections before Malaya's independence in 1957. It was held to elect members of the Federal Legislative Council, which prior to this was fully appointed by the British High Commissioner in Malaya.
The election was the first in which the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) contested. MIC joined the Alliance Party in 1954.
The Pan-Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP, later known as PAS) was formed primarily to contest in the 1955 election. Before that, PMIP was known as the "Pan-Malayan Islamic Association", as a part of UMNO. PMIP won support by proclaiming its aim of making Islam the base of the Malay society in the north of Malay Peninsula, which was facing the lowest economic growth in Malaya.
The election resulted in a decisive win for the Alliance, which consisted of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) and MIC, and a resounding defeat for Parti Negara, led by former UMNO president Onn Jaafar. Onn himself failed to win a seat, while the Alliance proceeded to form the new government, with its leader Tunku Abdul Rahman becoming Chief Minister.

[[Lecture hall]]

CATEGORIES: Educational facilities

A lecture hall (or lecture theatre) is a large room used for instruction, typically at a college or university. Unlike a traditional classroom with a capacity from one to four dozen, the capacity of lecture halls is typically measured in the hundreds. Lecture halls almost always have a pitched floor, so that those in the rear are sat higher than those at the front, allowing them to see the lecturer.  The importance of lecture halls is so significant that some schools of architecture have offered courses exclusively centered on their design.  The noted Boston architect Earl Flansburgh wrote numerous articles focusing on achieving efficacious lecture hall design.
Lecture halls differ from seminar rooms in that they allow for little versatility in use,http://www.crlt.umich.edu/learningspaceguidelines/largelecture.php although they are no less flexible than, for example, chemistry laboratories.  Experimentation, group work, and other contemporary educational methods are not practicable in a lecture hall.  On the other hand, lecture halls are excellent for focusing the attention of a large group on a single point, either an instructor or an audio-visual presentation, and modern lecture halls often feature audio-visual equipment. A microphone and loudspeakers are common to help the lecturer be heard, and projection screens may be used for large displays.  The acoustic properties of lecture halls have been the subject of numerous international studies,http://www.arch.ethz.ch/eggenschwiler/Vortrag13.pdf some even antedating the use of electronic amplification.

[[Solaris Live Upgrade]]

CATEGORIES: OpenSolaris, NCR products

Solaris Live Upgrade is a tool created in 2001 by Sun Microsystems, and introduced in Solaris 8 10/01, that allows computers running the Solaris OS to be patched or upgraded online, with only a single reboot required to activate changes.  Prior to Live Upgrade, upgrading a Solaris system required either reinstalling the system with the new operating system version, or rebooting from the distribution media and performing an interactive upgrade.  Live Upgrade was originally developed by NCR Corporation under the name VM&F (Version Migration & Fallback).http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:oEtSG_-yQckJ:www.info.teradata.com/eDownload.cfm%3Fitemid%3D003670275%26redirectfromfle%3Dy
Live Upgrade shipped with Solaris versions 8, 9, and 10, and could be installed on Solaris 2.6 and 7.  Live Upgrade was also part of Solaris Express, until the Solaris Express program was discontinued.  OpenSolaris does not include Live Upgrade, but includes another tool, beadm, that works on similar principles.
Live Upgrade works by copying the currently running operating system (called a boot environment) into a new boot environment on a different disk slice.  Operating system upgrades or patches can then be applied to the new environment, and will not affect the running system.  When the upgrade is complete, the system can be rebooted into the new environment.  If the upgrade is found to cause problems, it can be rolled back by rebooting back into the old environment.http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/live_upgrade.jsp"
In a typical Solaris configuration, with two root disks mirrored using Solaris Volume Manager, the lengthy initial copy can be avoided by splitting the mirror into two separate disks, one of which would remain the current root disk, and the other one would become the new boot environment.  On systems using ZFS as the root filesystem, this is no longer necessary, as Live Upgrade can quickly create a ZFS clone of the current environment to become the new boot environment.
Live Upgrade can be used for installing operating system patches without actually upgrading the system.  This avoids the requirement to reboot into single user mode before applying certain patches, and allows the system to be rolled back if the new patches cause problems.

VfL Stettin  was a German football club from the city of Stettin, Pomerania (today Szczecin, Poland).  The club dissolved at the end of the Second World War.
The origins of the club are in the establishment in 1912 of a football department within the gymnastics club Turnverein Stettin. The team went its own way as the independent side Verein für Leibesübungen Stettin in 1925. In 1930 the membership of Titania Stettin, which failed through bankruptcy, became part of VfL.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-89784-147-9
VfL twice took part unsuccessfully in the end round of the Pommern group of the Baltenverband in the early 30s. Following the re-organization of German football into 16 top-flight division under the Third Reich the club joined the Pommern-West group of the Gauliga Pommern. In three seasons there they were a lower table side and were finally relegated after a 7th place finish at the end of the 1935–36 season. VfL returned to first division play in 1939, capturing the Gauliga Pommern-West group and then defeating Germania Stolp (2:1, 0:1, 5:2) to claim the overall Gauliga Pommern championship. They were quickly eliminated in their only national level post-season appearance. Their title also earned them a place in the 1940 Tschammerspokal tournament, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), where they advanced two rounds before being eliminated by BuEV Danzig.Grüne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-928562-85-1 Stettin was relegated after another three-year turn ending in a last place finish in 1943. They played 3 matches in a truncated Gauliga Stettin season in 1944–45 before the country was overrun by advancing Allied forces at the end of World War II. The club disappeared at war's end as the city and surrounding region became part of Poland.

The Oxenden Baronetcy, of Dene in the County of Kent, was a title in the Baronetage of England. It was created on 6 May 1678 for Sir Henry Oxenden, previously Member of Parliament for Winchelsea, Kent and Sandwich. The second Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Sandwich and Kent. His younger brother, the third Baronet, was Deputy Governor of Bombay. The fourth Baronet was the son of George Oxenden, Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, who was the third son of the 1st Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for Sandwich for over thirty years. The sixth Baronet inherited the Kentish estate of the Dixwell baronets at Broome Park which became the family seat. The title became extinct on the death of the tenth Baronet in 1924.

The budgetary rulehttp://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/aenergy/Record-oil-revenues-2558183.html#.Ufei3m08l8o ([tpl]lang-no|handlingsregelen[/tpl]) is a rule concerning the usage of capital gains from The Government Pension Fund - Global of Norway. The rule was introduced in 2001 by the First cabinet Stoltenberg to ensure that the sovereign wealth fund, with a vast majority of its dealings related to activities in the petroleum industry, would secure sustainable development for the future generations of Norway. The budgetary rule will thereby continue to yield in the future, even when the petroleum resources of the North Sea and other operational areas come to an end.
The rule states that a maximum of 4% of the fund's value should be allocated to the yearly government budget. Disregarding the future petroleum income, the fund will still remain an important budgetary source of revenue. As of today, with the value of the pension fund increasing every year, the rule will secure even better conditions for today's and future generations. A broad majority of the political parties in Norway have agreed to comply with this fixed percentual usage.
The rule was partially intended to avoid a state of "Dutch disease".

[[Homotonal]]

CATEGORIES: Musical analysis, Musical keys

Homotonal (same-tonality) is a technical musical term pertaining to the tonal structure of multi-movement compositions. It was introduced into musicology by Hans Keller. According to Keller's definition and usage, a multi-movement composition is 'homotonal' if all of its movements have the same tonic (keynote).
'Homotonality' is by no means uncommon in compositions of the Baroque era: many Baroque multi-movement works based on dance-forms manifest the same tonic—and even the same mode (major or minor) -- throughout. Thus, for example, J.S. Bach's solo violin partita BWV 1004 is homotonal movements in D minor, as is his solo flute partita BWV 1013 movements in A minor. Similarly, Vivaldi's sonata for oboe and continuo RV53 (n.d.) is homotonal movements in C minor. Homotonality is even encountered in some Baroque concertos: examples include Vivaldi's Cello Concertos RV401 (n.d.) movements in C minor and RV416 (n.d.) movements in G minor, and Jean-Marie Leclair's Violin Concerto Op.7 No 1 (1737) movements in D minor.
With the Classical era, however, the situation changes. Outside of two-movement works (which, classically speaking, will maintain the same tonic for both movements and will thus be homotonal by definition), classical-era homotonality is relatively rare: a classical work in three movements will normally move to a different tonic for its middle movement, and a classical work in four movements will normally have at least one of its middle movements in a key other than the original tonic.
The classical composer most closely associated with the homotonal principle is Joseph Haydn. 
Keller himself was keen to emphasise that different classical composers showed differing degrees of interest in homotonal structure:
Musicological reactions to Keller's coinage and concept have not always been either respectful or mature. Musicologist William Drabkin, for example, felt entitled to pass over the issue with the question "doesn't 'homotonality' sound a trifle queer?" William Drabkin, review of Hans Keller, The Great Haydn Quartets: Their Interpretation, Musical Times, Vol. 127, No. 1726 (Nov., 1986), pp. 624-625 
The term 'homotonality' (referring to the manifest retention of a tonic) should not be confused with 'monotonality' (the theoretical position according to which a tonal structure has only one 'real' tonic, and all modulation is superficial or illusory).

The tune name is Russian Hymn in various modern hymnals, such as those of the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), or just Russia, as in The Hymnal 1982 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.

[[Epulon]]

CATEGORIES: Illyrian royalty, Kings, Ancient history of Slovenia, Illyrian Croatia

Epulon (Epulo, Epulone, Aepulo; ruled 181 – 177 BC) was a king or tribal leader of Histria in northern Illyria.Livy who described the Roman wars against the Histrians, calls him rex (king). Epulon was probably elected to leadership or kingship by a Histrian tribal council. Epulon conducted a series of wars against commanders sent by the Roman Republic during the Roman expansion of the first half of the 2nd century BC, until his death in 177 BC.Aleksandar Stipčević, Iliri: povijest, život, kultura history, life, culture
Rome had already consolidated its conquest of various peoples of northern Italy, and established good relations with the Adriatic Veneti. From there, Rome launched campaigns against the southern Illyrians of the Ardiaean Kingdom, and the northern Illyrians of the northern Adriatic and eastern Alps. Threatened by imminent loss of independence, Histria launched a first, indecisive attack against the Romans, in 221 BC. Another attack, in 181 at the new-founded colony of Aquileia, was beaten off by the Roman general, Q. Fab Buteoni,[tpl]who|date=April 2012[/tpl] who established a peace treaty with the Histrians. Later that year, Epulon became king of the Histrians; he was warlike, uncompromising and persistent, and immediately prepared for battle against the Aquilean colony. Rome sent an army in its defense in 178, under A. Manli Vulzonin,[tpl]who|date=April 2012[/tpl]Georg Veith, Die Eroberung Istriens and another, larger force in 177. The Histrians made a successful attack on a Roman camp and drove the legions in panic who quickly fled. Epulon's forces took a great booty of valuables, equipment, food and wine.  After initial successes in defeating his enemies at Aquilea, Epulon was defeated in northern Istria and forced to withdraw his forces to the Histrian capital of Nesactium.Croatian Adriatic coast, sightseeing, str. 55
Before attacking Nesactium the Romans captured other important Histrian centers in Istria. It is said that the Romans were at first unable to take Nesactium and did not made any success in their lengthy siege of the city. Under C. Claudius Pulcher who had brought two new legions, the success of their assault changed only when the Romans in a few days, diverted a river which protected Nesactium and provided them with water. The histrians chose to fight rather than to surrender the city. The Histrians killed their women and children and threw them from the city walls while at the same time fought the Romans. When Epulon realised that the Romans had won, he committed suicide by stabbing himself with a sword to avoid Roman captivity. The survivors were killed or captured. After the fall of Nesactium other Istrian cities so suffered the same faith. Soon all of Istria was conquered as well as the independence of the Histrians. According to Livy, 5,632 Histrians were sold into slavery.Livy, History of Rome 44.11 (trans Roberts, 1905); online at mcadams.edu: http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy41.html (accessed 16 September 2009)Livy 41.11

Albania's former Communists were routed in elections in March 1992 amid economic collapse and social unrest. 
Enver Hoxha, who ruled the Socialist People's Republic of Albania as a dictator for four decades, died on April 11, 1985. In 1989, the first revolts started in Shkodra; where the people wanted to demolish Joseph Stalin's statue and spread to other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world.
About 5,000 men and 450 women were executed under the rule of Enver Hoxha. 34,135 people were jailed; with 1,000 dying in prison.

The Lost Cement Mine is a legendary gold vein situated in the eastern Sierra Nevada of California, United States.[tpl]cite book|title=Lost Cement Mine|first=James|last=Wright|isbn=0-931378-09-5|year=1984|publisher=Live Oak Press[/tpl]
It was supposedly found in 1857 by two men who were separated from their group while crossing the Sierras.  They traveled near the headwaters of the Owens River, and found some hardened red igneous rock that may have had a large amount of gold in it. One of the men kept the ore, but was dying of tuberculosis in 1860, so gave the ore to a Doctor Randall in payment, along with a rough location of it. In miner's parlance of the era, the red igneous rock was known as "cement", hence the name of the lost mine.
Doctor Randall and his assistant Gid Whiteman spent years looking for the ore in the pumice hills to the south and west of Deadman Summit. News of the search leaked out to the mining communities near Mono Lake. This news caused a frenzy of furtive searching. Mark Twain was near Mono Lake and joined in the search, which was documented in his book  Roughing It.[tpl]cite book|title=Roughing It|first=Mark|last=Twain|year=1872|chapter=XXXVII|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Roughing_It/Chapter_XXXVII[/tpl]
James Wright wrote a series of newspaper articles about the search in 1879. He speculated that the lost cement was actually found across the Sierra Crest, near Devils Postpile. Wright claimed that the lost cement was mined for a number of years in secret, and then the mining cabin was destroyed to prevent others from finding the ore.

They were located in a gravel pit about 2.5 km before the Aniene merges into the Tiber river. The first skull was discovered in 1929, and appears to be that of an adult female. The second was found in 1935 by Professors Breuil and Blanc, and forms part of the face of possibly a 35-year old male. Both specimens appear to be neanderthal, but display characteristics that differed from classical neanderthal skulls.[ref]

The skulls were originally kept at the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Rome, then under the direction of Professor Sergio Sergi. During World War II he kept them hidden to preserve them from German officers seeking fossil treasures. When Professor Sergi retired as the director, the skulls went into his personal possession.

[[Fascism in Europe]]
CATEGORIES: 20th century in Europe, Politics of World War II, Fascism

Fascism in Europe was composed of numerous ideologies present during the 20th century which all developed their own differences from each other. Fascism was born in Italy and subsequently, across Europe several movements which took influence from it emerged. Purists assert that the term "Fascism" should only be used in relation to the National Fascist Party under Benito Mussolini in Italy.
However, commonly the following European ideologies are also described as forms of, or strongly related to fascism. The Falange in Spain under Francisco Franco, the Austrofascism in Austria under Engelbert Dollfuß, the 4th of August Regime in Greece under Ioannis Metaxas, the Sanation in Poland under Józef Piłsudski, the Ustaše in Croatia during the Interwar period and World War II, the Estado Novo in Portugal under António de Oliveira Salazar, and the Nazi Party of Germany under Adolf Hitler.
The most striking difference is the racialist and anti-Semitic ideology present in Nazism but not the other ideologies. Fascism was founded on the principle of nationalist unity, against the divisionist class war ideology of Socialism and Communism. Thus the majority of the regimes viewed racialism as counter productive to unity, with Mussolini asserting that "National pride has no need of the delirium of race".[tpl]cite book  |last=Montagu |first=Ashley |title=Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22+Nothing+will+ever+make+me+believe+that+biologically+pure+races+can+be+shown+to+exist+today%22&source=web&ots=ao7O_J0vr8&sig=22zZBSKlbcxbrBF1PXP3_PJygj0&hl=en |isbn=0-8039-4648-1[/tpl]
Italian Fascism was expansionist in its desires, looking to create a New Roman Empire. As was Nazi Germany, who looked to expand its borders. The same cannot be said for the other ideologies who focused almost exclusively on internal matters. This led to some countries, such as Spain or Portugal, remaining neutral in World War II, rather than being Axis powers, while Metaxas's Greece fought against the Axis, due to Italy's invasion. It is widely accepted that the Nazis murdered the Austrofascist dictator, causing an uneasy relationship between Fascism and Nazism at an early stage.
The question of religion also poses considerable conflicting differences, some forms of fascism, particularly the Falange and Estado Novo were devoutly Christian. Thus the occultist and pagan elements of Nazism, were directly opposed to the Christian element found in the vast majority of fascism movements of the 20th century.

Edward Robinson Squibb (July 4, 1819 – October 25, 1900) was a leading American inventor and manufacturer of pharmaceutics who founded E. R. Squibb and Sons, which eventually became part of the modern pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Squibb was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 4, 1819.  At age 26 he graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  He immediately became a ship's surgeon in the U.S. Navy, serving during the ongoing Mexican-American War.  After the war he ran the medical station at the Brooklyn Naval Yards.Obituary of E. R. Squibb, American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record 37 (July–December 1900), 287, located on Google Books.
As a Navy physician, Squibb became disenchanted with the poor quality of medicines used on American military vessels and, as a result, in 1854 he invented an improved method of distilling ether, an anesthetic.  He gave away his distillation method, rather than patent it for profit.Michael Rhode, "E. R. Squibb, 1854," The Scientist, 2008.
In 1858 he left the military and started his own pharmaceutics manufacturing business in Brooklyn.  His laboratory burned down three times, and in one of these instances an ether explosion left Squibb badly burned.
In 1892 Squibb created a partnership with his two sons, Dr. Edward H. Squibb and Charles F. Squibb, the firm being known for generations afterwards as E. R. Squibb and Sons.
Squibb died on October 25, 1900, at his home in Brooklyn, New York, from a ruptured blood vessel.

The minimum must weight requirements for Ausbruch is 27 degrees KMW. The Ausbruch Prädikat exists only in Austria and Hungary, not in Germany. The category was introduced into Austrian wine legislation in 1970, as a legalization of the production method allegedly already used in the area of Rust. Ruster Ausbruch are still the most common Ausbruch wines to encounter; in many other Austrian regions, producers classify their wines as Beerenauslese if they fall short of the Trockenbeerenauslese requirements.

It is an implementation the general Neglect of Differential Diatomic Overlap (NDDO) integral approximation, and is efficient and accurate. Related methods are AM1, PM3 and the older MNDO.
SAM1 was developed by M.J.S. Dewar and co-workers at the University of Texas and the University of Florida.  Papers describing the implementation of the method and its results were published in 1993 [tpl]Cite journal|journal=Tetrahedron|volume= 49 |year=1993|pages=5003–5038|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)81868-8|title=SAM1; the first of a new series of general purpose quantum mechanical molecular models|last1=Dewar|first1=Michael J.S.|last2=Jie|first2=Caoxian|last3=Yu|first3=Jianguo|issue=23[/tpl] and 1994.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Tetrahedron|volume= 50|year=1994|pages= 627–638|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)80782-1|title=Addendum to SAM1 results previously published|last1=Holder|first1=A|issue=37[/tpl]  The method is implemented in the AMPAC program produced by Semichem
SAM1 builds on the success of the Dewar-style semiempirical models by adding two new aspects to the AM1/PM3 formalism:
The performance of SAM1 for C, H, O, N, F, Cl, Br, and I is superior to other semiempirical methods, as shown below.  Especially noteworthy are the smaller systematic errors for heats for formation, indicating that SAM1 is more precise for this set of molecules.
One of the main advantages of abandoning the multipole expansion in favor of SAM1's methodology is that d-orbitals may now be more easily treated.  This allows calculations using atoms that use these orbitals as a part of their chemistry, such as the heavier main group elements and the transition metals.  SAM1 has been parameterized for the elements listed above as well as Si, P, S, Fe, and Cu.  Note that Cl, Br, and I did NOT include d-orbitals as part of the parameterization.

Cádiz Cathedral ([tpl]lang-es|Catedral de Cádiz, Catedral de Santa Cruz de Cádiz[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic church  in Cádiz, southern Spain, and the seat of the Diocese of Cadiz y Ceuta. It was built between 1722 and 1838. The cathedral was declared Bien de Interés Cultural in 1931.[tpl]Bien de Interés Cultural[/tpl]
The Plaza de la Catedral houses both the Cathedral and the Baroque Santiago church, built in 1635.
The church sits on the site of an older cathedral, completed in 1260, which burned down in 1596. The reconstruction, which was not started until 1776, was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero left the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was originally intended to be a baroque edifice, it contains rococo elements, and was finally completed in the neoclassical style. Its chapels have many paintings and relics from the old cathedral and monasteries from throughout Spain.
In the crypt are buried the composer Manuel de Falla and the poet and playwright José María Pemán, both born in Cádiz.
Poniente (or West) Tower, one of the towers of Cádiz Cathedral, is open to the public and shows panoramas of the city from on high.

The Arctic sea ice covers less area in the summer than in the winter. The multi-year (i.e. perennial) sea ice covers nearly all of the central deep basins.  The Arctic sea ice and its related biota are unique, and the year-round persistence of the ice has allowed the development of ice endemic species, meaning species not found anywhere else.   
There are differing scientific opinions about how long perennial sea ice has existed in the Arctic. Estimates range from 700,000 to 4 million years.

Swedish inventions are novel ideas and machines that have been pioneered in Sweden.
In the 18th century Sweden's scientific revolution took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from professionals who had immigrated from mainland Europe. In 1739, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded, with people such as Carolus Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members.
Sweden has a total of 33523 patents as of 2007 according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and only ten other countries have more patents than Sweden. Although a lot of patents cannot count as inventions. Therefore the number of patents per country is a relatively bad scale for measuring inventions that has been of progress to mankind.Patents By Country, State, and Year - All Patent Types (December 2007)

Richard T. Williamson (born 1958) is a non-fiction writer who has written many books and articles on asset protection, estate planning, and capital gains tax planning. He is a California attorney specializing in estate planning and forming business entities such as corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs). His books are designed to approach tax strategies and asset protection from a real estate investor's perspective. 
In capital gains tax planning, Richard T. Williamson is considered one of the early experts contributing to the understanding and use of the tax deferral strategy known as the private annuity trust. After his initial book on the subject in 2003, private annuity trusts became increasingly popular with financial and real estate advisors. Specialized companies sprang up across the US marketing private annuity trusts to the general public sometimes misrepresenting the benefits or applying the strategy inappropriately. The growing popularity and perceived abuse of private annuity trusts drew the attention and scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service and on October 18, 2006 the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that basically eliminated any tax deferral benefits of private annuity trusts created after that date.
Richard's expertise in capital gains tax planning and real estate investing has been noted and called upon by the Wall Street Journal on three separate occasions The Secret to Selling High And Deferring High Taxes - WSJ.com Trusts Offer Tax Savings On Donated Real Estate - WSJ.com http://www.masonlawyers.com/images/WSJ_patdeftax.pdf as well as by the J.T. Foxx Radio Show. The JT Foxx Show Additionally, he has had his work featured in Investment Adviser Magazine.http://www.investmentadvisor.com/print.php?printscreen=yes&topic=&article=5551
Richard earned his Bachelors of Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California and his Juris Doctor from Southwestern University School of Law.
He currently resides and has his law practice in Long Beach, California.

[[Living Legend (Art Pepper album)]]
CATEGORIES: 1975 albums, Art Pepper albums

Living Legend is a 1975 jazz album by saxophonist Art Pepper playing with Hampton Hawes, Charlie Haden and Shelly Manne.
This was Art Pepper's 'comeback' album, the first to be released after his long absence due to drug addiction and incarceration in San Quentin prison. Pepper had been finally released in 1966 and for a while only played tenor saxophone, showing how much of an influence John Coltrane had been on him in the intervening years. In 1968 Buddy Rich asked him to join his big band on alto; Pepper borrowed an alto and, in his words, quoted in the sleeve notes to this album, 'discovered I was able to say everything I wanted to say and I didn't have to sacrifice my individuality to be accepted or to be modern'.
Following two operations for a ruptured spleen, Pepper moved into Synanon, a rehabilitation centre for recovering addicts, and began the slow return to full-time performing and recording.

Garbh Bheinn is a steep mountain in the Ardgour area in the west of Scotland. It is much more prominent, in both a general and topographic sense, than many Munros, but because it is under 3000 feet and in a geographically isolated area, it is relatively infrequently climbed. Like other summits in the Ardgour area, it has been cited by those who deride the obsession with Munro bagging. From the summit, there are extensive views east to Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe, and west to several islands.

Young Communist League of Lithuania ([tpl]lang-lt|Lietuvos komunistinio jaunimo sąjunga[/tpl]) was a political youth movement in the Lithuanian SSR, Soviet Union. It was formed at a congress in June 1989, as the Leninist Young Communist League of Lithuania (LLKJS), the Lithuanian republican branch of the All Union Leninist Young Communist League (VLKSM), broke away from VLKSM and formed an independent organization.Pilkington, Hilary. Russia's youth and its culture: a nation's constructors and constructed. London: Routledge, 1994. p. 164 The break came after a survey had shown that only 11% of young Lithuanians considered that the LLKJS should have remained in the VLKSM.Pilkington, Hilary. Russia's youth and its culture: a nation's constructors and constructed. London: Routledge, 1994. p. 163
The new organization did not adhere to the principles of democratic centralism. The shift was however not only organizational, but also represented a break in political orientation. The formulated goal of VLKSM of 'progress towards communism' was replaced by a pledge to 'defend the sovereignty of the Lithuanian SSR'. A sector of the erstwhile Leninist Young Communist League of Lithuania decided to remain in VLKSM, and formed a new Lithuanian republican branch of VLKSM.
In defiance of an amended election system, LKJS refused to nominated delegates to the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet.Pilkington, Hilary. Russia's youth and its culture: a nation's constructors and constructed. London: Routledge, 1994. p. 170
The LKJS contested the 1990 Lithuanian elections, separately from the Communist Party. The organization did not win any seats though.http://www2.essex.ac.uk/elect/electer/lt_er_nl.htm
Alfonsas Macaitis was the First Sectary of the youth league. Maciatis claimed that the organization was the continuation of the interbellum Young Communist League of Lithuania. According to Maciatis, the interbellum youth league had been illegally annexed to the VLKSM.
In October 1990, the youth league was transformed into the Youth Forum of Lithuania. The youth league decided to hand over all its proporties to the new organization.

After bowing out at the top of their game, Thorn started the short lived Warbomb!, was employed as an assistant brewmaster, and then began crafting the music for his solo debut. Upon the release of "Where's The Freedom?" in 2007 Adam Thorn & The Top Buttons, a backing band of rotating members, played sporadic shows culminating in a performance in Greensboro, NC on December 16, 2007. Thorn vanished from the public eye following a severe car accident early in 2008 and has not been seen or heard from since. 
There are unconfirmed rumors of a man resembling Thorn being sighted around the Greensboro area in 2010 sporting either a Nehru jacket or some sort of Indian headdress.  Most of these claims have been dismissed as either hoax or collective dreaming.

It is directed by South African-born Hong Kong filmmaker Lawrence Ah Mon, about a city where baseball is almost unknown, and where the team plays to empty stadia. It explores several themes traditionally regarded as 'taboo' in Hong Kong society, in an unusually open, convention-defying way, and features full-frontal male nudity in several scenes. It is the first of five such films by Scud (the stage name of Hong Kong writer/film producer Danny Cheng Wan-Cheung). The four later films are: Permanent Residence in 2009, Amphetamine in 2010, Love Actually... Sucks! in 2011, and his most recent, Voyage, in 2013.

Zwaggle is a community of parents who gather online to share their children's gently-used toys, clothing, books, gear and more with other families. Instead of using cash to buy or sell items, members post items to Zwaggle and use points, called Zoints, to release and/or accept items. By participating, parents de-clutter their homes of unwanted things that are still useful and in doing so save money, conserve material/natural resources and continue the life-cycle of products instead of relegating them to a landfill.

[[Chloroformic acid]]

CATEGORIES: Carboxylic acids, Chloroformates

Chloroformic acid is an unstable chemical compound with the formula ClCO2H. It is the single acyl-halide derivative of carbonic acid (phosgene is the double acyl-halide derivative). Chloroformic acid is also structurally related to formic acid, which has a hydrogen instead of the chlorine. Despite the similar name, it is very different from chloroform.
Chloroformic acid itself is too unstable to be handled for chemical reactions. However, many esters of this carboxylic acid are stable and these chloroformates are important reagents in organic chemistry. They are used to prepare mixed carboxylic acid anhydrides used in peptide synthesis. Like other related halocarbons, it is a potentially dangerous alkylating agent.
Important chloroformate esters include 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, fluorenylmethyloxycarbonylchloride, benzyl chloroformate and ethyl chloroformate.

SS Straßburg was a German association football club from the city of Straßburg, Elsass (today Strasbourg, Alsace in France).
The team was founded in 1900 as FC Frankonia 1900 Straßburg when the region was under German control. Following the end of World War I the territory of Alsace was returned to France and the team became part of that country's competition as Sport-Club Red-Star Straßbourg. In August 1940, after the Nazi conquest of the province, Frankonia collapsed, but was immediately re-constituted out of its former membership as Sportgemeinschaft Schutzstaffel Straßburg in September.Grüne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ISBN 3-928562-85-1
The formation of military clubs was common in Germany at the time, but the creation of an SS side required the permission of Schutzstaffel head Heinrich Himmler. SG became part of the Gauliga Unterelsass, a regional first division established in the territory of Elsass, without having to first qualify. The side was quickly strengthened by the addition of other SS members who were required to leave behind their original clubs to don the white and black kit bearing the SS rune as a crest.
In their second season, in what had since become the Gauliga Elsaß, SG easily won the division and advanced through the national playoffs to the quarterfinals, where they were put out by eventual champions FC Schalke 04, who emerged as the dominant side of the era. They also took part in the 1942 Tschammerpokal tournament, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and went as far as the third round before being crushed 1:15 by TSV 1860 München on their way to a cup triumph. Their turn in the national playoffs was the highpoint of the Straßburg side's history; they could earn only third and second place results in their next two campaigns. Play in the Gauliga Unterelsass never got underway in the 1944–45 season as Allied armies began their advance through Europe and into Germany, with SG disappearing in 1944.Grüne, Hardy (2001).

[[U.S. Route 44 in New York]]

CATEGORIES: U.S. Highways in New York, Transportation in Ulster County, New York, Transportation in Dutchess County, New York, U.S. Route 44

U.S. Route 44 (US 44) in the state of New York is a major east–west thoroughfare in the Hudson Valley region of the state. Its entire [tpl]convert|65.98|mi|2|adj=on[/tpl] length is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with the exception of the Mid-Hudson Bridge, which is maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority. The portion of the route in New York begins at an intersection with US 209 and New York State Route 55 (NY 55) near the hamlet of Kerhonkson and ends at the Connecticut state line near the village of Millerton. The road passes through rural parts of Ulster and Dutchess counties before crossing into Litchfield County, Connecticut.
Most of the route in Dutchess County was once part of the Dutchess Turnpike, an early road interconnecting Poughkeepsie to various settlements in Dutchess County. US 44 was designated [tpl]c.|1935[/tpl] and had no major changes in alignment until 2007, when it was relocated onto New York State Route 44A, a highway that bypassed the village of Millbrook to the northwest. The NY 44A designation was deleted as a result of the relocation, and signage for NY 44A was taken down in April 2008. US 44's original alignment through Millbrook became NY 984P, an unsigned reference route.

Jürgen Ehlers ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈjʏʁɡŋ̩ ˈeːlɐs|lang[/tpl]; December 29, 1929 – May 20, 2008) was a German physicist who contributed to the understanding of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. From graduate and postgraduate work in Pascual Jordan's relativity research group at Hamburg University, he held various posts as a lecturer and, later, as a professor before joining the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich as a director. In 1995, he became the founding director of the newly created Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.
Ehlers' research focused on the foundations of general relativity as well as on the theory's applications to astrophysics. He formulated a suitable classification of exact solutions to Einstein's field equations and proved the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern cosmology. He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and philosophy of physics and was an ardent populariser of science.

The Lex Trebonia was passed in 55 BC during the second joint consulship of Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great").  Sponsored by the tribune Trebonius, the legislation granted each outgoing consul an extended five-year proconsular command. Crassus received the province of Syria, with the barely disguised intention of launching an invasion of Parthia. Pompeius received the provinces of Nearer Spain and Further Spain, but remained in Rome and conducted his administration through legates.
At the same time, Gaius Julius Caesar's term as governor of the provinces Transalpine Gaul, Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum was extended, hostilities in Gaul having reignited. By law, Caesar could not run for a second consulship until 10 years after his first, and he wished not to return to Rome as a private citizen.

[[Flipism]]

CATEGORIES: Coin flipping, Decision theory, Fictional philosophies

Flipism, sometimes written as "Flippism," is a pseudophilosophy under which all decisions are made by flipping a coin. It originally appeared in the Disney comic "Flip Decision"Carl Barks: Flip Decision, Walt Disney Comics & Stories 149, Vol. 13, No. 5 (1953). by Carl Barks, published in 1953. Barks called a practitioner of "Flipism" a "Flippist" (with two P's).Information taken from Michael Barrier book "Carl Barks and the Art of the Comic Book", page MBAC-176. Information on novel taken from the Carl Barks Library (page 8C-532).  More information can be found in a "Lost in the Andes" article in The Carl Barks Library (set 1)
An actual coin is not necessary: dice or another random generator may be used for decision making.
Flipism can be seen as a normative decision theory, although it does not fulfill the criteria of rationality.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

[[Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame]]

CATEGORIES: American rodeo, Sports halls of fame, Museums in Fort Worth, Texas, American West museums in Texas, Sports museums in Texas

Now housed in the Historic Cowtown Coliseum in the Fort Worth Stockyards. The organization, dedicated to the sport of rodeo and the recognition of Texas' contribution to that sport, the TRCHF was founded in 1975 by Johnny Boren and a group of Belton, Texas, businessmen. Boren was the manager of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) Lone Star Circuit, the biggest circuit in Prorodeo's circuit system. Johnny Boren, a Ford automobile dealer in Belton, frequently had world champion cowboys across the desk from him at his dealership. Autographed photos of world champs adorned both his office and his home. He was a well-known bull rider and founder of the Old Timers Rodeo Association.
The Hall of Fame was first housed in several spots in the Belton-area, including a western wear store. Eventually, the Hall of Fame moved to the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, only a block or so away from the Ford dealership where it was born.
They currently have an induction ceremony usually in March or April, that takes place at the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, Texas every year.
The Hall of Fame is currently run by a Board Of Directors from all over the state of Texas. Funds are currently being raised for a permanent Hall of Fame building in Belton. The Hall contains pictures and biographies of famous Texas rodeo cowboys who helped to shape the sport from its inception until the present.
In 2005, the Hall of Fame inducted as members the former rodeo performer and promoter Dan Collins Taylor of Doole, Texas, and his wife, the Berva Dawn Sorensen Taylor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2011/07/19/news/20local_07-19-11.txt|title=Becky Orr, "Cowboy was boss of Chute 9 at CFD for 49 years''|publisher=wyomingnews.com|accessdate=August 4, 2011[/tpl]

Founded in 1996, First Folio, originally named First Folio Shakespeare Festival, is located on the grounds of the Mayslake Peabody Estate in Oak Brook, Illinois, USA.   First Folio utilizes the "Folio Method" as developed by Patrick Tucker (at one time of the Royal Shakespeare Company), who first introduced his approach to American actors, directors and teachers in a series of workshops sponsored by the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City at The Shakespeare Center beginning in 1982, which led to an awakened interest in the First Folio.Patrick Tucker, the author of Secrets of Acting Shakespeare: The Original Approach (Routledge Press, November, 2001), brought his first Acting Shakespeare workshop to New York City in the early 1980s, hosted by the Riverside Shakespeare Company.The First Folio of Shakespeare, Introduction by Doug Mostin, Applause Books, 1995, p. vii.

The First Folio Theatre is listed as a Major Festival in the book Shakespeare Festivals Around the World by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004.
First Folio currently has three difference performance venues on the grounds of the historic Mayslake Peabody Estate.

James Marion Asbell (born June 22, 1914 in Dallas, Texas) nicknamed "Big Train", was an outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Nicknamed "Big Train," his career was a brief one, consisting of a single season, the Cubs' World Series year of 1938.
After a college career that included stints at both Tulane and Rice, Asbell signed with the New York Giants. After some time in the minors, the Cubs took Asbell in the 1937 Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut with the Cubs on May 8, 1938. With the Cubs, Asbell appeared in just 17 games, playing only ten in the field. He committed no errors as a defender, but his offense was subpar, as he batted just .182 (6 for 33) with 2 doubles, 3 RBI, and no stolen bases. He played his last game as a Cub, and as a major leaguer, on October 2, 1938. He made no appearances with the club in the World Series.
Asbell died on July 6, 1967 in San Mateo, California.

Naye Prese ([tpl]lang-yi|נײַע פּרעסע[/tpl]) was a Yiddish-language communist daily newspaper published in Paris, France. The first issue was published on January 1, 1934. The initiative to start publishing Naye Prese was taken by a sector of Jewish members of the French Communist Party. Prior to the founding of Naye Prese there had been other Yiddish-language communist periodicals which had been banned by the French state authorities.Programme of ESSHC
Naye Prese was one of two daily Yiddish newspapers published in Paris during the interbellum period, the other being the pro-Zionist Parizer Haynt. Moreover, Naye Prese was the sole communist Yiddish daily in Europe at the time.Frankel, Jonathan/Diner, Dan (ed.). Dark times, dire decisions : Jews and Communism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 72, 173
The Jewish membership of the French Communist Party was rather limited, numbering around 200-300 at the time of the founding of Naye Prese. But communist ideas had widespread support amongst the Jewish communities in France. Initially Naye Prese had a readership of around 10,000. Many of its readers were émigré Polish Jews, who had been militants of the Communist Party of Poland but had not joined the French Communist Party after settling down in France. In 1936, after an intensive election campaign of the French Communist Party amongst the Jewish communities and the formation of the Popular Front government, the readership reached 20,000.
Leo Katz served as the chief editor of Naye Prese, before joining into exile in Mexico.EIAL V2 - The Last Battles of Old-World Ideologies in the Race for Identity and Communal Power: Communists vs. Bundists vs. Zionists in   Mexico, 1938-1951
Naye Prese was banned during the German occupation of France.Frankel, Jonathan/Diner, Dan (ed.). Dark times, dire decisions : Jews and Communism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 181
During the early 1950s, Naye Prese had a daily edition of 8,700. It was the largest of the three Yiddish left-wing dailies in Paris at the time. In the summer of 1951, French authorities ordered the deportation of the editor of Naye Prese, Jacob Gromb. Gromb, a Polish-Jewish immigrant who had become a French citizen in 1950, was charged by the authorities with not having 'assimilated enough' to French society. There was widespread protests against this decision, also outside of communist quarters. When the Gromb case was decided in court, the deportation order was revoked.http://69.20.59.207/AJC_DATA/Files/1953_9_WestEurope.pdf
On November 7, 1969, the Friends of Naye Prese issued a statement, with the backdrop of the 1968 Polish political crisis, condemning anti-Semitic policies of the Polish government.http://69.20.59.207/AJC_DATA/Files/1970_11_EastEurope.pdf
Naye Prese was closed down in 1993.Frankel, Jonathan/Diner, Dan (ed.). Dark times, dire decisions : Jews and Communism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 78Colloque sur la culture yiddish

This uncertainty perhaps stems from the many loose sculptures of deities that exist and the degradation of primary wall images.

Monmouth Town F.C. is a Welsh football club based in the historic town of Monmouth. The team currently play in the Welsh Football League Division One. The club is a member of Gwent County F.A.  On 8 August 2011, Monmouth Town F.C. entered into an agreement to be purchased by internet venture fivepoundfootballclub.com.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-14448234 |title=Monmouth FC chosen for web fans' investment plan. |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 January 2012 [/tpl] In September 2011 the Club established itself as a Community Interest Company, the first of its kind in Wales. The club's rally cry is "Kingfishers All The Way!"  
The Monmouthshire Beacon reports in 7 October 1876 that Monmouth Town FC will commence its season on 12 October. There is evidence to suggest that an ’association club’ was playing in all white at Dixton Road in the town in the year 1906. The Monmouth Beacon of 14 December recalls this and adds a comment about a period when football had been extinct in Monmouth.  Indeed research shows that Monmouth were joint champions of the Monmouth and District League in 1925/26 with Clearwell FC.
The next honour recorded by the Town was victory on the Monmouthshire Senior cup on the eve of war in 1940, defeating Lovell’s Athletic, (aka the Toffeemen) then about to lift the Southern League West title, 3-2 at Monmouth Sportsground which is still home today.
Nearly 20 years later, in 1958, the Town lifted the Monmouthshire Amateur cup beating Cefn Fforest 3 – 0 at Pontllanfraith. The following season saw victories in both the Monmouthshire senior and Monmouth Amateur cups.
Town's only appearance in the FA Cup was a 2nd preliminary round defeat away at Llanelli on 6 October 1945.
Silverware has been scarce since with wins in the Gwent amateur cup in 1984 and 1996 being highlights of many years gracing the fields of Newport and the Gwent Leagues with an occasional foray into the English Forest of Dean and Herefordshire leagues.
More recently the Town were relegated to the bottom tier of the Gwent County just three years ago. The returning Andrew Smith took up the reins and gained promotion in his first season in charge finishing runners up to Rogerstone. At the beginning of 2005/06 season the club adopted ‘the Kingfishers’ nickname and logo in homage to a peculiar legend outlined later.
The season ended with fourteen match winning run as Town clinched the Gwent County Division Two title ahead of Newport Civil Service.
2006/07 almost saw a repeat but were Town were pipped by Civil for the title. However, The Kingfishers were offered the chance to take the step into the Welsh league for the first time in their history.
The Kingfishers won the Division Three title in 2010/11 and followed it with The Division Two title in 2011/12, Dan MacDonald scoring a remarkable 44 goals.
Their first ever season in Division One ended with a seventh place finish after topping the table as late as March. The Kingfishers were also finalists in the Gwent Senior Cup for the first time since 1940 but lost out 1 - 0 to Caldicot Town.

Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) is the first Aladura Pentecostal church present in Nigeria and other countries. It has come into existence in the first half of the
20th century, in the then-British empire. It was formally established in 1941 after a split from the Apostolic Church which the original Aladura organization (Faith Tabernacle) had invited to Nigeria. Its growth was led by Joseph Ayo Babalola, a road construction driver who became its founder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greatrevivals.com |title=Great Revivalist |publisher=Great Revivals |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04[/tpl]
The revival led by Babalola resulted in thousands burning their traditional fetishes. This disturbed the colonial authorities, and allegations included witch-hunting and opposition to hospitals and medicine. Babalola was arrested and jailed.

Fredereric John "Lefty" Baczewski (born May 15, 1926) was a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. After some time in the independent minor leagues, Baczewski was purchased from his Shreveport club in October 1949 by the Cubs for $30,000 and a player to be named. He worked his way up through the Cubs' minor league system and made his debut with the parent club on April 26, 1953.
Baczewski appeared in nine games as a reliever, posting an ERA of 6.30 in ten innings, before he was traded with Bob Kelly to the Reds in exchange for Bubba Church. With the Reds, Baczewski was primarily a starter and had a very solid season, sporting an 11-4 record and completing 10 of his 18 starts while recording a solid 3.45 ERA. His winning percentage of .733 was good for sixth in the National League, and his ten complete games also placed in the league's top ten. He had secured his spot in the Reds' starting rotation for the 1954 season.
However, Baczewski's career would stall after his impressive rookie campaign. In 1954, he started 22 of his 29 games but was only able to break even with a 6-6 record as his ERA ballooned to 5.26. In 1955, Baczewski opened the season with the Reds but made just a single relief appearance, allowing 2 runs in one inning on April 16. He would never pitch in the majors again.

CATEGORIES: Astronomical objects discovered in 2008, Extragalactic astronomy, Supernovae

SN 2008D is a supernova detected with NASA's Swift X-ray telescope. The explosion of the supernova precursor star, in the spiral galaxy NGC 2770 (88 million light years away (27 Mpc), was detected on January 9, 2008, by Carnegie-Princeton fellows Alicia Soderberg and Edo Berger, and Albert Kong and Tom Maccarone independently using Swift.[ref]
</ref>  They alerted eight other orbiting and ground-based observatories to record the event. This was the first time that astronomers have ever observed a supernova as it occurred. 
The supernova was determined to be of Type Ibc. The velocities measured from SN2008D indicated expansion rates of more than 10,000 kilometers per second. The explosion was off-center, with gas on one side of the explosion moving outward faster than on the other. This was the first time the X-ray emission pattern of a supernova (which only lasted about five minutes) was captured at the moment of its birth. Now that it is known what X-ray pattern to look for, the next generation of X-ray satellites is expected to find hundreds of supernovae every year exactly when they explode, which will allow searches for neutrino and gravitational wave bursts that are predicted to accompany the collapse of stellar cores and the birth of neutron stars.
"Supernovae are the explosions of massive stars—stars more than 8 times the mass of the Sun—whose cores run out of nuclear fuel and collapse in on themselves to form a neutron star or a black hole. In the process they launch a powerful shock wave that blows up the star. Until now, observations of these objects have been of the aftermath, typically several days after the initial explosion."

The Labouchere was a paddle steamer in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, 
built in 1858 at Green's in Blackwall, London, England.Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Shipwreck Database Under the command of Captain J. Trivett it was mostly in service in British Columbia and the rest of the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s and 1860s. In 1859, its then-captain John Swanson was elected by a "celebrated" majority of one (there was only one qualified elector) in the colonial riding of Nanaimo for the Legislative Assembly of the Colony of Vancouver Island.British Columbia: From the earliest times to the present, Vol II, E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, p. 156.
By 1865-66 the Labouchere served the San Francisco to Victoria run. On its second run on that route, under the command of W.A. Mouat and carrying 100 passengers and cargo on behalf of Faulkner, Bell & Co., the Labouchere was grounded in heavy fog off Point Reyes after disembarking San Francisco  on April 14, 1866 and, after backing off the reef and staying offshore overnight, sank on the morning of the 15th. One of eight lifeboats was swamped, incurring the loss of two lives. Those in the lifeboats were picked up by Rescue ; 23 men who had stayed on board were rescued by the Italian fishing vessel Andrew  just before the Labouchere sank beneath the waves.The Labouchere - Paddle Steamer, at the Labouchere school of seamanship website.

[[Pakistan–Russia relations]]
CATEGORIES: Pakistan–Russia relations, Bilateral relations of Russia, Bilateral relations of Pakistan

Pakistan–Russian relations or Russo-Pakistan relations refers to the bilateral, historical, cultural, and international relations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Russian Federation. The Soviet Union and Pakistan first established the diplomatic and bilateral relations on 1 May 1948.Speech of H.E. Mr. Sergey Peskov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan at the Jubilee Function on the occasion of celebration of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Pakistan - Official Website of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
For the most of the Cold War, the Soviet Union relations with Pakistan have seen ups and downs during the different periods of Pakistan. In 1947-50s, Soviet Union enjoyed relatively healthy and strong relations with Pakistan when it was under the civilian control but the relations went ultimately cold soon after the U.S.-backed 1958 military coup d'état, although attempts to warm the relations were made after the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war and in midst of 1970s, the relations were quickly improved and warmed.
In response to ongoing Soviet support to communist Afghanistan regarding the Durand Line issue during the late 1970s and 1980s, Pakistan began to support Mujahideen rebels attempting to overthrow the Soviet-backed communist regime and was later supported by the United States, United Kingdom, China and Saudi Arabia. This later led to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
Due to rapidly shifting global geopolitical interests spurred by the end of the Cold War and the ongoing U.S.-led War on Terror, Pakistani public opinion towards Russia has fluctuated in recent years, with 18% viewing Russia favorably in 2007, falling to 11% in 2011 and rising to 20% in 2012,Pakistani Opinion of Russia Pew Research Global Opinion Project and according to the BBC World Service Poll, 9% of Pakistanis view Russian influence positively in 2010,2010 BBC World Service Poll BBC  14% in 2011,2011 BBC World Service Poll BBC falling to 12% in 2012,2012 BBC World Service Poll BBC and increasing to 18% in 2013.2013 BBC World Service Poll BBC
However, Pakistanis have generally rated Vladimir Putin's leadership poorly, with 7% expressing confidence in him in 2006, and only 3% in 2012,Pakistani Confidence in Putin and for the most part, a plurality of Russians have consistently rated Pakistan's influence negatively, with 13% expressing a positive view in 2008,2008 BBC World Service Poll BBC increasing slightly to 14% in 2010, and falling to 8% in 2013.

Earthquake simulation applies a real or simulated vibrational input to a structure that possesses the essential features of a real seismic event.  Earthquake simulations are generally performed to study the effects of earthquakes on man-made engineered structures, or on natural features which may present a hazard during an earthquake.
Dynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical – as with shake-table testing – or virtual (based on computer simulation).  In all cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, researchers prefer to deal with so called 'real time-histories' though the last cannot be 'real' for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements.

In 1981, the two collections merged, and in 1986, they opened to the public in the Louvre.
Today, the museum occupies 9,000 square meters and displays approximately 6,000 items at any time. It draws from its collections of over 81,000 works representing the history of costume from the French Regency period to the present (16,000 costumes and 35,000 fashion accessories), and textiles from the 7th century onwards (30,000 works), as well as examples of interior design, furniture, objets d'arts, wallpaper, tapestry, ceramic art, glassware, and toys from the Middle Ages to the present.
Important French fashion designers and textile artists whose works are held in the collection include Azzedine Alaïa, Pierre Balmain, André Courrèges, Christian Dior, Christian Lacroix, Jeanne Lanvin, Paul Poiret, Paco Rabanne, Yves Saint Laurent, Elsa Schiaparelli, Madeleine Vionnet, Sonia Delaunay, Raoul Dufy, and others.

CATEGORIES: 20th-century symphonies, Compositions by Wilhelm Furtwängler

Wilhelm Furtwängler's Symphony No. 3 in C-sharp minor was written between 1951 and 1954. It is in four movements:
At first, the four movements had programmatic headings: "Disaster," "Under compulsion to life," "Beyond" and "The conflict continues."Gottfried Kraus, liner notes to Orfeo d'Or CD C 406 961 B, translated to English by Lionel Salter. In the German original, Kraus gives the headings as "Das Verhängnis," "Im Zwang zum Leben," "Jenseits" and "Der Kampf geht weiter." At the time of his death, Furtwängler was still working on the last movement. In 1956, Joseph Keilberth conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in the première of the first three movements. Elisabeth Furtwängler did not allow the Finale to be performed until much later (a piece more complete than, say, the Finale of Bruckner's Symphony No. 9). Yehudi Menuhin conducted the public premiere of the whole piece in 1986, four years after a transmitted BBC studio performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Brian Wright.Lionel Salter's translation identifies this as January 25, 1956, "the centennial of Furtwängler's birth," but that's actually two years after his death. The German original says January 25, 1986, "Furtwänglers 100. Geburstag."

CATEGORIES: Museums in Stuttgart, History museums in Germany, 1869 establishments in Württemberg, Museums established in 1869

The Landesmuseum Württemberg (Württemberg State Museum) is the main historical museum of the Württemberg part of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It emerged from the 16th-century “Kunstkammer” (art chamber) of the dukes, later kings, of Württemberg who resided in Stuttgart. As a museum it was founded in 1869 by King William I.
The museum's main location is the Old Castle in Stuttgart. The nearby granary and the cellar of the New Castle also contain parts of the collections as well as Waldenbuch Castle outside of Stuttgart. The collections are grouped into three divisions:
Apart from these collections the museum regularly features special exhibitions.
The museum presents a whole range of archeological treasures and a notable collection of medieval art. It also includes the inventories of the former army and manufacturing museums. Some of the most valuable possessions of the museum were already acquired by the dukes for their art chamber: two of only four preserved Aztec feather shields from before 1521 and the oldest preserved card game, about 1430, richly decorated and expensive already at the time of production. Exhibits of local origin include a celestial globe of 1493 by Johannes Stöffler, a 11-digit mechanical calculator of 1774 by Philipp Matthäus Hahn, first to build functional calculators to Gottfried Leibniz' design for all four arithmetic operations, and, less unique, but probably the museum's most symbolic exhibit: the royal Württemberg crown of 1797.
The museum today has a further seven branches throughout Württemberg referring to special topics:
Several other former branches now belong to the separate Baden-Württemberg State Archeological Museum (Archäologisches Landesmuseum Baden-Württemberg), which has been founded in 1990 due to the ever increasing findings of archeological heritage in the state.

CATEGORIES: French anatomists, 1797 births, 1849 deaths, 19th-century French physicians, People from Orléans, French medical writers, 19th-century French writers

Jean-Baptiste Marc Bourgery (May 19, 1797 – June 1849) was a French physician and anatomist who was a native of Orléans.
In 1815 he began his studies in Paris, where he attended courses given by naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829). From 1817 to 1820 he worked as an interne at Parisian hospitals, and subsequently spent several years as a medical officer at the copper foundries in Romilly-sur-Seine. In 1827 he returned to Paris and received his medical doctorate.
In 1830 he began work on Traité complet de l’anatomie de l’homme comprenant la médecine operatoire., a masterpiece on human anatomy that was published in eight volumes. Bourgery worked on the atlas until his death in 1849, with the last volume being published posthumously. The finished work contained 2108 pages of folio-sized text and 726 hand-colored lithographs. The illustrative work was performed by Nicolas-Henri Jacob (1782–1871), who was a student of famed painter Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825).
The first five volumes of Traité complet de l'anatomie de l'homme dealt with descriptive anatomy; volumes six and seven covered surgical anatomy; and the last volume discussed general and philosophical anatomy. It is considered to be one of the most comprehensive and beautifully illustrated anatomical works ever published.

Each Director changes the focus of the programming creating exhibitions, publications and events that examine a diverse range of artists and ideas. These appointments along with guest curators permit the gallery to place an emphasis on the discursive structures of the environments that art is created in.  Regardless of the Director/Curator the Or Gallery maintains a commitment to contemporary art that is challenging and experimental. The gallery supports and exhibits artists whose work is critically, issue, and/or conceptually based.Food For Thought, Sara Edmunds, 2004 p.5

The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-Rays released very early on in its formation, rather than by the optical light emitted during the later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity.Gemini Observatory Media Release

CATEGORIES: Temnospondyls, Transitional fossils, Prehistoric amphibians of North America, Permian amphibians, Fossil taxa described in 2008

Gerobatrachus is an extinct genus of amphibamid temnospondyl (represented by the type species Gerobatrachus hottoni) that lived in the Early Permian, approximately 290 million years ago (Ma), in the area that is now Baylor County, Texas. When it was first described in 2008, Gerobatrachus was announced to be the closest relative of Batrachia, the group that includes modern frogs and salamanders. It possesses a mixture of characteristics from both groups, including a large frog-like head and a salamander-like tail. These features have led to it being dubbed a frogamander by the press. Some more recent studies place Gerobatrachus as the closest relative of Lissamphibia, the group that contains all modern amphibians including frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, or place modern amphibians far from Gerobatrachus within a group called Lepospondyli.

[[Graveyard Fields]]
CATEGORIES: Landforms of North Carolina, Pisgah National Forest, Blue Ridge Parkway, Protected areas of Transylvania County, North Carolina

Graveyard Fields is the name of a flat mountain valley in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina.  The valley - itself over 5,000 feet in elevation - is surrounded by mountains exceeding 6,000 feet in elevation, such as Black Balsam Knob, Tennent Mountain, and Sam Knob. These high peaks form the source of the Yellowstone Prong of the Pigeon River, which flows through Graveyard Fields valley.
The valley's name may originate from a time when a great windstorm felled hundreds of spruce and fir trees on its slopes.  These moss-covered stumps resembled graves.  Another theory says that, extensive logging during the early 1900s left stumps behind.  Mosses and lichens grew on the stumps, resembling an overgrown graveyard.
Later, during the time when this area was logged, major forest fires swept through the area.  These fires devastated the entire valley, and heated the soil enough to sterilize it.  Even now, plants have difficulty growing in the fire-ravaged soils, although some trees, shrubs, and grasslands are slowly beginning to thrive.

Rufus Rivers Meadows (born August 25, 1907 in Chase City, Virginia) was a left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds in 1926. He appeared in just one game, an 18-1 loss to the Chicago Cubs. Meadows faced the Cubs' final batter of the game, inducing an out to finish off the blowout loss by his Reds. He holds the record for facing the fewest batters by a pitcher who played only one MLB game.[tpl]cite web|title=Baseball-Reference|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/coffee.shtml|work=Cup of Coffee Pitchers|accessdate=1 May 2012[/tpl] He also batted once in the game and did not reach base, finishing with a lifetime batting average of .000 to match his lifetime ERA of 0.00. 
Meadows was only 18 when he had his brief moment as a major leaguer, and he was the second-youngest player to play in the National League that season, trailing only future Hall of Famer Mel Ott.
Meadows died May 10, 1970 in Wichita, Kansas.

[[The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook]]
CATEGORIES: 1954 books, Books by Gertrude Stein, Cookbooks

The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book, first published in 1954, is one of the bestselling cookbooks of all time. Written by Alice B. Toklas, writer Gertrude Stein's life partner, Toklas wrote this book as a favor to Random House to make up for her unwillingness at the time to write her memoirs, in deference to Stein's 1933 book about her, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. 
This work is as much of an autobiography as it is a cookbook, in that it contains as many personal recollections as it does recipes. The most famous culinary experiment contained therein is a concoction called Hashish Fudge.[tpl]cite web|last=Serif Books|title=The Alice B Toklas Cookbook – Extract|url=http://serifbooks.co.uk/books/cookery/recipes/?book=18|accessdate=1 May 2014[/tpl]  Made from spices, nuts, fruit, and Cannabis, Hashish Fudge quickly became a sensation in its own right. In the recipe, Alice described how it is called "the food of paradise" and goes on to suggest places where the cook might find the illegal ingredient named in its title. She stated that this was something that can liven up any gathering and is "easy to whip up on a rainy day." She cautions two pieces of it are quite enough and that one should be prepared for hysterical fits of laughter and wild floods of thoughts on "many simultaneous planes." 
Although later Toklas said that this recipe was given to her by a friend named Brion Gysin, her name is forever linked with marijuana brownies due to its great success. Particularly in the late 1960s, Toklas' brownies were referenced. For example, in the 1968 Peter Sellers movie I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, Toklas' cannabis brownies play a significant role in the plot. In a 1969 episode of the ABC-TV variety show Hollywood Palace hosted by Diana Ross & The Supremes, member Mary Wilson tells Diana that show guest and comedian Soupy Sales has asked The Supremes to bake him a pie, to which Diana Ross replies to her group mates: "A pie, huh?  Well, you better not use the recipe you got from Alice B. Toklas"! Also in 1969, an episode of "Bewitched" called "Tabitha's Weekend", Endora (Agnes Moorehead) makes a joke about eating Mother Stephens' (Mabel Albertson) raisin cookies when Tabitha asks if "Grandmama" would like one too.  When offered one, Endora says "They're not by chance from an Alice B. Toklas recipe?"  Mrs. Stephens says, "They're my recipe."  To which Endora says "Then I think I'll pass."

Robert Wydow (c. 1446 – 1505) was an English poet, church musician, and religious figure. 
Born in Thaxted, Essex, he was initially educated by his stepfather, who was the local schoolmaster. By 1455 or 1456, he was studying music and Latin in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, where he was a chorister.Bowers, Roger (2004). "Wydow, Robert (c.1446–1505)". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (subscription required). Oxford University Press. Retrieved on May 20, 2008. He was admitted to Eton College as a scholar, where he studied from about 1460 to 1464, when he returned to King's College, graduating in either 1467 or 1468.[tpl]acad|id= WDW464R|name=Wedow, Robert[/tpl] He followed in his stepfather's footsteps post-graduation, becoming schoolmaster for Thaxted. He also tutored the sons of nobility.Bowers, Roger. "Wydow Viduus, Robert". Grove Music Online (subscription required). ed. L. Macy. Retrieved on May 21, 2008. 
He came to the notice of Edward IV, who named him chaplain of the Black Prince's Chantry at Canterbury Cathedral in 1474, a position he held for four years. In either 1478 or 1479, he was awarded a Bachelor of Music degree from Oxford University; he is the earliest known recipient of this degree. During this period, degrees were conferred on recipients who had already distinguished themselves professionally; there was no residential study. Upon conclusion of Wydow's service at the Black Prince's Chantry, he was awarded benefices at Monks Eleigh, Suffolk (1479–81), Thaxted (1481–9), St Benet Paul's Wharf, London (1489–93), and Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire (1493–8). In 1497, he was appointed a canon of Wells Cathedral, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He was promoted to the office of subdean on 25 May 1500. He was buried at the south aisle of the cathedral on 4 October 1505.
Wydow's contemporaries held him in high esteem as a poet and musician. Raphael Holinshed called him an "an excellent poet", and John Leland described him as "easily the finest" of Latin authors of the time. However, only a few lines of his poetry survive.

Martial Bourdin (1868 - 1894) was a French anarchist, who died on 15 February 1894 when chemical explosives that he was carrying prematurely detonated outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich Park.
Although Bourdin sustained massive injuries, he remained alive and able to speak.  He did not, however, reveal his name, specific target, or motives. He was carried to the Seamen's Hospital nearby, where he died 30 minutes later.
Later, police investigators discovered that Bourdin had left his room on Fitzroy Street in London and traveled by tram from Westminster to Greenwich Park.  The police concluded that "some mischance or miscalculation or some clumsy bungling" had caused the bomb to explode in Bourdin's hand.[tpl] cite web | title = Propaganda by Deed - the Greenwich Observatory Bomb of 1894 | url = http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/astronomy-facts/history/propaganda-by-deed-the-greenwich-observatory-bomb-of-1894 | publisher = Royal Museums of Greenwich [/tpl]  Because he was found with a large sum of money, the police speculated that he had planned to leave for France immediately.
The police later raided the Club Autonomie in London -- a popular club for foreign anarchists, including Bourdin.

The Master of the Khanenko Adoration was a Flemish painter active at the end of the fifteenth century.  His style is influenced by those of Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling, and Robert Campin; additionally, echoes of the work of Joachim Patinir and Gerard David may be seen in some of his paintings.  His name is derived from an Adoration of the Magi, now in the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kiev, that once belonged to the Khanenko collection.  Also ascribed to him are a Madonna and Child in Stuttgart and an Adoration of the Magi in Saint-Omer, although both attributions have been disputed.

CATEGORIES: Mongol Empire, Nomadic groups in Eurasia, Golden Horde, 14th-century monarchs in Asia

Bayan (or Buyan; Naiyan Баян) (r.1302-1309) was one of most famous khans of White Horde. "Bayan" means "rich" and "buyan" means "good deed/act" (as in religion or belief) in the Mongolian language.
When Bayan became the khan, his cousin and relatives revolted against him. The latter, under his cousin Kobluk, were supported by Khaidu and Duwa. Bayan fought his rebel cousin, Koblek, and Kaidu's forces several times. He asked help from  Tokhta, ruler of the Golden Horde and the Blue Horde. Tokhta was angry with the situation, and warned Khaidu not to help the rebels. 
Buyan also tried to ally with Temur Oljeitu of the Yuan Dynasty, the suzerain of Mongol Empire, against the Chagatai Khanate and Khaidu. But the distance between them made it ineffective.René Grousset-The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, p.211 Finally, Bayan defeated his enemies and ruled his Horde till 1309. It is claimed that Circassians, Russians and Hungarians (probably Bashkirs) served in his army.Encyclopedia of Mongol Empire, see White Horde

[[Master of Nördlingen]]

CATEGORIES: German sculptors, Anonymous artists, 15th-century artists, 15th-century German people

The Master of Nördlingen was a German woodcarver active in Nördlingen in the 1460s.  His name comes from a group of wooden sculptures carved for the high altar of the Georgskirche in Nördlingen; these depict the Crucifixion, with figures of the Virgin, John the Apostle, two grieving angels, Saint George, and Mary Magdalene.  All are of walnut, and retain their original paint schemes.  Initially the altar had a pair of wings with painting by Friedrich Herlin; in 1683 these were removed and replaced by a Baroque housing.  Nothing further has been ascribed to the artist, although a third angel figure of doubtful attribution is now in a museum in Kaiserslautern.

Henk Peeters (8 December 1925 – 13 April 2013) was a Dutch artist.http://nos.nl/artikel/495349-kunstenaar-henk-peeters-overleden.html He was part of the ZERO movement.
Peeters was born in The Hague.  He studied Fine Art at the Koninklijke Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague and taught from 1957 until 1972 at the Art Academy in Arnhem, the Netherlands. 
Together with other Dutch artists, such as Jan Henderikse, Armando and Jan Schoonhoven, Peeters formed the NUL movement in the 1960s. This movement was opposed to the Cobra movement and wanted objective art, art that was divorced from any emotional value. Later on, the NUL movement joined up with the international movement ZERO. Members of this group included Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, and Yves Klein.
Henk Peeters exhibited from 1958 onwards, mainly in group exhibitions and nationally as well as internationally.  He died, aged 87, at Hall, near Brummen.

Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993),508 U.S. 366 Full text of the opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com. was a 1993 Supreme Court of the United States case. Decided June 7, 1993, the Court unanimously held that, when a police officer who is conducting a lawful patdown search for weapons feels something that plainly is contraband, the object may be seized even though it is not a weapon.  By a 6-to-3 vote, however, the court held that the officer in this case had gone beyond the limits of a lawful patdown search before he could determine that the object was contraband, making the search and the subsequent seizure unlawful under the Fourth Amendment. 
Associate Justice Byron White gave the opinion of the court.

[[Friedrich Herlin]]

CATEGORIES: 1500 deaths, 15th-century German painters, Year of birth uncertain, Year of birth unknown, Gothic painters, People from Bavaria

Friedrich Herlin (c. 1425/30 – 1500) was a German painter.  His earliest known work, depicting scenes from the Life of the Virgin, is dated 1459.  A signature on an altarpiece in Nördlingen, dating it to 1462, identifies him as being from Rothenburg, as do citizenship documents from 1467.  Nevertheless, it is possible that he lived there for only a short time, and that his origins lie in Ulm, where a painter named Hans Herlin lived and worked from 1449 until 1468.  Stylistically, he borrowed much from Rogier van der Weyden, indicating a great deal of familiarity with the art of the Netherlands and of Cologne.  The sculpture attached to the altarpiece of 1462, though officially listed as by the so-called "Master of Nördlingen", has been tentatively ascribed to Nicolaus Gerhaert, which if true would indicate extensive contacts to the highest artistic circles of the era.
Little else is known of Herlin, save that he died in Nördlingen in 1500.

[tpl]nihongo|Neku Sakuraba|桜庭 音操|Sakuraba Neku|ネク Neku[/tpl] is a fictional character in the Nintendo DS video game The World Ends with You. He is an antisocial teenage boy who claims he does not "get" people, and rarely interacts with others. Under mysterious circumstances, he finds himself participating in the Reapers Game and is forced to fight for his life, teaming up with a girl named Shiki Misaki. He allies himself with several other characters, including: Yoshiya Kiryu, who goes by Joshua; Daisukenojo Bito, who goes by Beat; Raimu Bito, who goes by Rhyme and is Beat's sister; and Sanae Hanekoma, an artist acting as a coffee shop owner.
Since appearing in The World Ends with You, Neku has received mostly positive reception. While some have described him as being emo and "whiny", his growth as a character has received praise, with G4TV describing it as growing from a mute teenager to a civil human, a concept that people over the age of 20 could identify with. He has been compared to several other characters created by Square Enix, including Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy VII, Squall Leonhart of Final Fantasy VIII, and Roxas of Kingdom Hearts, due to his "brooding" personality.

[[Lex Luthor (Smallville)]]
CATEGORIES: Fictional characters introduced in 2001, Superman in other media, Fictional businesspeople, Fictional murderers, Smallville characters, Fictional Presidents of the United States, Fictional characters from Kansas, Fictional American people of Scottish descent

Lex Luthor is a fictional character from the television series Smallville. He was a series regular from the pilot episode until the season seven finale, and has been played continuously by Michael Rosenbaum, with various actors portraying Lex as a child throughout the series. The character of Lex Luthor, first created for comic books by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1940 as nemesis of Superman, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar—this is only the third time the character has been adapted to a live action television series. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville television series, none of which directly continues from or into the television episodes.
In this 2001 series, Lex Luthor is sent to Smallville, by his father Lionel Luthor, to run the local LuthorCorp fertilizer plant. After driving his car off a bridge, he is saved by Clark Kent and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy. As the series unfolds, Lex's curiosity about Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship. Lex's relationship with his father is tension-filled from the start of the show, and eventually comes to an end when Lex murders his father in an effort to discover Clark's secret.
The Smallville incarnation of Lex Luthor is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks a fine line between good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.

Clark Kent is a fictional character on the television series Smallville. The character of Clark Kent, first created for comic books by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938 as the alternate identity of Superman, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, the fourth time the character has been adapted to a live-action television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by Tom Welling, with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the Smallville series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, Smallville[tpl]'[/tpl]s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen young adult novels.
In the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.
When developing Smallville[tpl]'s[/tpl] version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the "... bare essence ..." of Superman; he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also "... good to the core". In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ. Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple Teen Choice and Saturn Awards for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show's first season.

[[Material failure theory]]
CATEGORIES: Mechanical failure, Plasticity, Solid mechanics, Mechanics, Materials science, Materials degradation

Failure theory is the science of predicting the conditions under which solid materials fail under the action of external loads. The failure of a material is usually classified into brittle failure (fracture) or ductile failure (yield).  Depending on the conditions (such as temperature, state of stress, loading rate) most materials can fail in a brittle or ductile manner or both.  However, for most practical situations, a material may be classified as either brittle or ductile. Though failure theory has been in development for over 200 years, its level of acceptability is yet to reach that of continuum mechanics.
In mathematical terms, failure theory is expressed in the form of various failure criteria which are valid for specific materials.  Failure criteria are functions in stress or strain space which separate "failed" states from "unfailed" states.  A precise physical definition of a "failed" state is not easily quantified and several working definitions are in use in the engineering community.  Quite often, phenomenological failure criteria of the same form are used to predict brittle failure and ductile yield.

[[Golden age of physics]]

CATEGORIES: History of physics

A Golden age of physics appears to have been delineated for certain periods of progress in the physics sciences, and this includes the previous and current developments of cosmology and astronomy. Each "golden age" introduces significant advancements in theoretical and experimental methods. Discernible time periods marking a "golden age" of advancements are, for example, the development of mechanics under Galileo (1564–1642) and Newton (1642–1727). Another small epoch seen as a golden age is the unification of electricity, magnetism, and optics because of 19th century notables, including Faraday, Maxwell, and others.
Significant advancements in methods of investigation were introduced for celestial mechanics, which includes realizing a universal gravitational force, with the introduction of the telescope. Basing mechanics on experimental results was possible with the development of devices that could measure time, and tools for measuring distance. The advances in electromagnetism in the 19th century enamored physicists, as another golden age closed, and there was a reluctance to perceive further advancement. Hence, the progress of one era, termed a "golden age" has appeared to mark the completion of physics as a science. Yet, this perception has turned out to be erroneous. For example, around 1980, Stephen Hawking predicted the end of theoretical physics within 20 years. Around 2001, he amended his prediction to twenty years more from that year. Stephen Weinberg predicts a unified physics by 2050. Tadeusz Lulek, Barbara Lulek, and A. Wal – the authors of a 2001 book – believed themselves to be at the beginning of a new "golden age of physics".
Paul Davies notes that whilst "many elderly scientists" may regard the first 30 years of the 20th century as a golden age of physics, historians may well, instead, regard it to be the dawning days of "the New Physics".
The golden age of physics was the 19th century. According to Emilio Segrè, in Italy it came to an end in the 18th century, after the time of Alessandro Volta.  He reported in his autobiography that Enrico Fermi felt that it was coming to an end in 1933.  A golden age of physics began with the simultaneous discovery of the principle of the conservation of energy in the mid-19th century.  A golden age of physics was the years 1925 to 1927.  The golden age of nonlinear physics was the period from 1950 to 1970, encompassing the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam problem and others.  This followed the golden age of nuclear physics, which had spanned the two decades from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s.  A golden age of physics started at the end of the 1920s.
The golden age of physics cabinets was the 18th century, with the rise of such lecturer-demonstrators as John Keill, John Theophilus Desaguliers, and William Whiston, who all invented new physics apparatus for their lectures.

CATEGORIES: 1812 births, 1873 deaths, Florida Supreme Court justices, People from Petersburg, Virginia, Florida Democrats, Florida lawyers

Samuel J. Douglas ([tpl]#formatdate:October 10, 1812[/tpl] – [tpl]#formatdate:November 14, 1873[/tpl]) was an American politician and jurist. A Democrat originally from Virginia, he served on the Florida Territorial Court of Appeals (during the era of Florida Territory) 1841–45 and the Florida Supreme Court 1866–68.
Douglas was born in Petersburg, Virginia. He graduated from the University of Virginia and entered into the practice of law in Southampton County, Virginia. 
President John Tyler, a family friend, appointed Douglas to the Florida Territorial Court of Appeals on October 12, 1841, after a mutual friend refused the post and recommended Douglas instead. He subsequently appointed him to a four-year term on February 15, 1842. 
This was a tumultuous time in Florida history, and Douglas met the task of restoring the rule of law to curb both criminal offenders and planters and businessmen trying to escape responsibility for their debts. His firmness made him sufficiently unpopular that after statehood, the Florida Legislature did not reappoint him to the Bench. He then opened a legal practice in Tallahassee until he was appointed Collector of Customs at Key West in 1849. 
In 1847, he married  Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Brown, the daughter of Governor Thomas Brown, after the death of his first wife. He opened a law office in 1853, and practiced law on Key West until outbreak the Civil War. His secessionist tendencies made him persona non grata to Federal authorities, and he returned to Virginia. He served the Confederate States of America as a military judge, and returned to Florida after the cessation of hostilities.
In the summer of 1865, he became a private secretary to Governor William Marvin. In 1866, Governor David S. Walker appointed Douglas to replace Justice Augustus E. Maxwell. He was one of four Justices appointed by Governor Marvin. In the uncertainty of Florida under Federal occupation, Douglas' efforts centered on resolving conflicts Florida and military officials. In 1868, he left the Court to return to private practice. 
He died November 14, 1873 in Tallahassee of a stroke.

Johann Veit (17 June 1852, Berlin – 2 June 1917 near Schierke) was a German gynecologist. He was the son of obstetrician and gynecologist Gustav Veit (1824-1903).
In 1874 he earned his medical degree at Humboldt University in Berlin, and in 1879 became an assistant physician at the university Frauenklinik. While still a student, he served as a medic during the Franco-Prussian War.
In 1893 he attained the title of professor extraordinarius (associate professor), afterwards serving as a professor at the Universities of Leiden (1896), Erlangen (1902) and Halle (1904). At Halle he served as university rector in 1911-12.
Veit is renowned for adapting the knowledge of immunology into the field of gynecology. He was successful in treatment of cancer with radium, and was involved in training nurses and midwives for service in the German colonies and diaconal hospitals in the Middle East.Catalogus Professorum Halensis (biography) 
During his tenure in Berlin, Veit worked closely with Carl Arnold Ruge (1846-1926) in establishing gynecological histopathology standards, particularly involving the setup of microscopic diagnostics for early detection and analysis of uterus carcinomas.  
His written works included publications on female reproductive anatomy, gynecological diseases and ectopic pregnancy. With Robert von Olshausen (1835-1915), he was co-editor of Karl Schroeder's Lehrbuch der Geburshülfte.Pagel: Biographical Dictionary

Laurence Curran Hodgson (November 6, 1874 – March 24, 1937) was an American newspaper journalist, poet, and politician from Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
Hodgson was a newspaper reporter and columnist, writing at different times for the Minneapolis Times and the St. Paul Dispatch-Pioneer Press. He had a column that appeared daily on the back page of the Dispatch called "Cabbages and Kings," a reference to Lewis Carroll's poem, "The Walrus and the Carpenter."
He commonly wrote under the pen name "Larry Ho." The name came about when he had written his first feature article for the Times. He was signing his name, "Larry Hodgson," but his pencil broke after the first "o." The city editor, James Gray, reportedly said, "Better let it go at that–'Larry Ho.'"
He served as secretary to both St. Paul mayors Winn Powers and Vivian R. Irvin, and upon the expiration of Irvin's term, he was elected mayor by a large majority. He served two non-consecutive terms as mayor from 1918 to 1922, and from 1926 to 1930.
Hodgson also ran for governor in 1920, but came third in the race, garnering only 81,293 votes.[tpl]cite web|title=Minnesota vote for governor since 1857|url=http://www.sos.state.mn.us/index.aspx?page=653|publisher=Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State|accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl]

[[Ars Conjectandi]]
CATEGORIES: 1713 books, Mathematics papers, 1713 in science, Statistics books

Ars Conjectandi (Latin for The Art of Conjecturing) is a book on combinatorics and mathematical probability written by Jakob Bernoulli and published in 1713, eight years after his death, by his nephew, Niklaus Bernoulli. The seminal work consolidated, apart from many combinatorial topics, many central ideas in probability theory, such as the very first version of the law of large numbers: indeed, it is widely regarded as the founding work of that subject. It also addressed problems that today are classified in the twelvefold way, and added to the subjects; consequently, it has been dubbed an important historical landmark in not only probability but all combinatorics by a plethora of mathematical historians. The importance of this early work had a large impact on both contemporary and later mathematicians; for example, Abraham de Moivre.
Bernoulli wrote the text between 1684 and 1689, including the work of mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat, and Blaise Pascal. He incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations—the aforementioned problems from the twelvefold way—as well as those more distantly connected to the burgeoning subject: the derivation and properties of the eponymous Bernoulli numbers, for instance. Core topics from probability, such as expected value, were also a significant portion of this important work.

[[Chinese ritual bronzes]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese bronzeware, Chinese art, Bronze Age in China, Bronze Age art, Art terminology

Sets of ritual bronzes are the most impressive surviving objects from the Chinese Bronze Age.  From around 1650 BCE they were deposited as grave goods in the tombs of royalty and the nobility, and were evidently produced in very large numbers, with documented excavations finding over 200 pieces in a single royal tomb.  They were produced for an individual to use in ritual offerings of food and drink to his ancestors in family temples or ceremonial halls over tombs, or rather ritual banquets in which both living and dead members of a family participated; early literary records speak of these.  On the death of the owner they would be placed in his tomb, so that he could continue to pay his respects in the afterlife; other examples were cast specifically as grave goods.Rawson, 44-60
The ritual bronzes were probably not used for normal eating and drinking; they represent larger, more elaborate versions of the types of vessels used for this, and made in precious materials. Apart from table vessels, weapons and some other objects were made in special ritual forms. Another class of ritual objects are those, also including weapons, made in jade, which was probably the most highly valued of all, and which had been long used for ritual tools and weapons, since about 4,500 BCE.Rawson, 44-60
At least initially, the production of bronze was probably controlled by the ruler, who gave unformed metal to his nobility as a sign of favour.Rawson, 33-34

It became the debut single for the band, and was released on EMI's Parlophone label, on 16 October 1982, the same day as the 20th anniversary re-release of Love Me Do by The Beatles, who made this EMI label world famous. The original vinyl issue of 101 Dam-Nations by Scarlet Party on Parlophone R 6058, reached number 44 in the UK chart, and is at present deleted, However, the recording has since appeared on many compilations, and is now available to download.

[[Full Court]]

CATEGORIES: Courts by type

A Full Court (less formally, full bench) refers to a court of law consisting of a greater-than-normal number of judges. Thus, in relation to a court usually presided over by a single judge, a Full Court would comprise a bench of three (or more) judges; for a court which, like many appellate courts, normally comprises three judges, a Full Court of that court would involve a bench of five (or more) judges. The expression originated in England but seems largely to have fallen into disuse there; however it is still used in ScotlandE.g., in the Court of Criminal Appeal. and in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia,See, for example, the Judiciary Act 1903 (Aust.) section 19 in relation to the High Court of Australia. New Zealand,See the Judicature Act 1908 (NZ). South Africa, India, Pakistan etc. Although possible, a Full Court typicallyExceptions being where the participation of all the appointed judges is the usual composition for main hearings, as with the High Court of Australia. does not involve the participation of all the existing judges of the court (a practice known, in the United States, as the court sitting en banc).
The term reflects the practice, before permanent appeal courts were established, of appeals from decisions of trial courts being heard by several judges of the same court (usually excluding the judge who gave the decision appealed from). Technically, a judgment of a Full Court is at the same level of the judicial hierarchy as the decision appealed from, and under the doctrine of precedent mayDepending on how the doctrine of precedent applies to the particular court. not bind future courts at that level; however the greater number of judges involved and the fact that it is an appeal may make it almost as persuasive, in practice, as a judgment of the same number of judges in a higher court. 
The historical trend to create separate courts of appeal, with permanent rather than ad hoc appellate judges, has reduced the need for the use of Full Courts. However they are still sometimes found in cases of great significance where there is either no possibility or no likelihood of a further appeal.Recent (rare) examples at the level of the House of Lords include the second Pinochet extradition case  and the challenge to the use of evidence obtained by torture, in both of which a panel of seven judges sat rather than the usual five.  The UK Supreme Court, which in 2009 succeeded to the judicial functions of the House of Lords, has adopted a more frequent practice of sitting as a bench of seven or even nine judges in important cases; however, it does not appear to use the terms "full court" or full bench" in reference to this practice.

CATEGORIES: Banach spaces, Functional analysis

In the mathematical field of functional analysis, the space bs consists of all infinite sequences (xi) of real or complex numbers such that

Furthermore, with respect to metric induced by this norm, bs is complete: it is a Banach space.
The space of all sequences (xi) such that the series
is convergent (possibly conditionally) is denoted by cs.  This is a closed vector subspace of bs, and so is also a Banach space with the same norm.
The space bs is isometrically isomorphic to the space of bounded sequences ℓ∞ via the mapping

Mesa Power, a company controlled by former Texas oilman, T. Boone Pickens, planned to build the world's largest wind farm, called the Pampa Wind Project, as part of the Pickens Plan. The proposed 4,000 MW facility was to be located near Pampa, Texas, which is on the Texas Panhandle, and stretch to the east, spanning [tpl]convert|400000|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] in five counties. This would provide enough power for 1.5 million average homes. Mesa Power placed an order for 667 wind turbines from General Electric — the world's largest wind turbine order for a single location.  The first phase of the project, 1000 MW, was planned to go online before 2011 before the project was halted. Mesa Power places world’s largest single-site wind turbine purchase orderPickens Bets $2 Billion on Wind Power Project[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2009[/tpl] Lease payments for the land used by the turbines were expected to cost $65 million a year. The total cost of the project was estimated at $8–10 billion.
By way of comparison, as of May 2008, the largest U.S. wind plant was the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center with a capacity of 736 MW.
On March 2, 2009, Mesa announced that it was proceeding with the first phase of the project, but had put off work on the later phases, and canceled 120 of 197 wind leases.[ref]

In July 2009, Pickens delayed (but did not cancel) the project, citing the lack of transmission capacity to the site and a poor credit market.Pampa wind farm delayed, not canceled, Pickens says[ref]

Breaking Away is a 1980 American comedy-drama television series that was based on the 1979 film of the same name. It was created by Steve Tesich, who wrote the original film, and the film's director Peter Yates served as Executive Producer. 
As a prequel, the series was set during the year prior to the events of the film. Shaun Cassidy took over the role of Dave Stohler (played by Dennis Christopher in the film), a young man mad about bicycle racing and all things Italian. Barbara Barrie, Jackie Earle Haley and John Ashton reprised their roles from the film. The television series was set in Bloomington, Indiana, but was actually shot in Athens, Georgia.

While heavily promoted by ABC, it was overlooked by TV audiences once it got on the air and suffered low ratings. It was cancelled after eight episodes were filmed, though only seven episodes aired during its original run. ABC showed reruns of the show during the summer of 1981, and it was also rerun by the Arts & Entertainment cable channel during 1985–1987.

Heywood was born in Liverpool, Lancashire to Benjamin and Phoebe Heywood, née Ogden. He was educated at Warrington Academy, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, though as a Unitarian did not attend college chapel, and could not graduate as he would not subscribe to the Church of England's 39 Articles.G. M. Ditchfield, ‘Heywood, Samuel (1753–1828)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 29 Dec 2008. Heywood is not mentioned at all in Venn, J. & J. A., Alumni Cantabrigienses. He studied law at the Inner Temple, rising to prominence as a lawyer and barrister. He was called to the Bar in 1778. Based at Lancaster, Lancashire, he was appointed Serjeant-at-Law (1795) and also Chief Justice of the Carmarthen Circuit of Wales (1807). He was one of very few religious dissenters holding a national public office at this time. He was a fierce opponent of the high church aspects of Anglicanism.

[[Strip road]]
CATEGORIES: Types of roads

A strip road is a dirt road with two narrow, parallel strips of asphalt, one for each wheel. Roads of this kind are found in parts of southern Africa, particularly Zimbabwe.
When two cars on a strip road approach each other from opposite directions, each is expected to move away from the centre of the road and use only one strip until the other car has passed.
Asphalt strip roads were built in Southern Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was then known, from 1933 onwards as a relatively inexpensive way of opening up the country for development. Asphalt was chosen after an early experiment with concrete strip roads proved too costly. 
By 1938, strip roads covered a total distance of 1,890 kilometres, including an unbroken stretch linking the capital, Salisbury (today called Harare), with the southern border town of Beitbridge. By 1945 the total exceeded 3,300 kilometres.From Dirt Tracks to Modern Highways: Towards a History of Roads and Road Transportation in Colonial Zimbabwe, by Alois S. Mlambo.

After World War II, many of the strip roads were replaced with full-width asphalt roads but some remain, particularly in more remote areas.
In neighbouring Zambia, the phrase "strip road" sometimes refers to a road with a single strip of asphalt in the middle, wide enough for one vehicle.Zambia: The Bradt Travel Guide http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=170

CATEGORIES: 15th-century painters, 15th-century Czech people, Czech painters, Anonymous artists, Czech expatriates in Austria, Czech expatriates in Germany, People from Moravia

The Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece (sometimes called the Master of Raigern) was a Bohemian painter active in the region around Olomouc and Brno before 1420.  Likely of Moravian extraction, he derives his name from an altarpiece that once hung in the church of Saint Maurice in Olomouc; since disassembled, some of its panels are now in Rajhrad.  These depict scenes from the Passion and from the Legend of the True Cross, and were painted before 1420.  Two scenes, the Transportation of the Cross (Image) and the Crucifixion, are believed to be by his hand, while the rest are products of his studio.  Also ascribed to him are the altarpiece of Náměšť, also dating to before 1420 and today found in Brno, and an Altarpiece of Saint Jacob of about 1430, today dispersed between Prague, Brno, Vienna and Nuremberg.
The Master influenced the work of artists even beyond Bohemia; work by the Master of the Saint Lambrecht Votive Altarpiece indicates that his style was known even in Vienna.  Some historians conflate him with the Master of Ambrass, but not all agree with this assessment.

[[Exit (Alice album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1998 albums, Alice (singer) albums, Italian-language albums

Exit is the fourteenth studio album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in 1998 on WEA/Warner Music.
After the musically experimental and lyrically introspective albums Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi (1992) and Charade (1995) Alice released Exit in 1998, her most pop-oriented and melodic studio album since the late 1980s. As Allmusic wrote in their review: "the album often suggests Sarah McLachlan in a duet with Enigma".
The lead single "I Am a Taxi" was a lyrically minimalistic up-tempo dance groove with influences from contemporary R&B and electronica, and the single included further dancefloor friendly remixes. The second single release, "Open Your Eyes", was an English/Italian language duet with Skye Edwards, lead singer of British electronica and trip-hop band Morcheeba, recorded shortly after the release of their 1998 album Big Calm (#18 UK). "Open Your Eyes" was co-written by Alice, producer Francesco Messina, singer-songwriter Juri Camisasca and Peter Hammill of Van der Graaf Generator and was again one of the most accessible and chart-oriented tracks the singer had recorded since Il Sole Nella Pioggia. The promo video showed the two singers performing the song sitting in a rowing boat on a sunny summer's day in London's Hyde Park. Third single "Dimmi Di Sì" ("Tell Me Yes") was a midtempo ballad which juxtaposed subtle club beats and ambient keyboard effects against acoustic guitars. Exit also included a second duet between Alice and Italian alternative rock band Bluvertigo's Morgan, "L'immagine" ("The Images"), and the two were to duet again on both Personal Jukebox in 2000 and Viaggio in Italia in 2003. The one minute eighteen seconds "Il cielo sopra il cielo" was an excerpt from the ambient/crossover group project Devogue's eponymous 1997 debut album, a forty-five minute sound collage which had featured vocals by Alice on five of the thirteen titles. 
The acoustic track "1943", written by Alice's longtime collaborator Mino di Martino, and lyrically influenced by the works of German poet and playwright Else Lasker-Schüler, draws parallels between the horrors of the Holocaust and the at the time on-going war in The Balkans, and its so called ethnic cleansing. When playing the song live on the following Exit tour Alice specifically urged her audiences to donate money to organisations helping refugees from the former Yugoslavia coming to Italy. She later also performed the song in Italian manifestations against the Iraq War. 
Exit closes with a cover version of French poet, composer, singer and musician Léo Ferré's "L'Étranger" ("The Stranger"), a poem by Charles Baudelaire set to music by Ferré and first released on his 1967 album Léo Ferré Chante Baudelaire. 
Both the "I Am A Taxi" and "Open Your Eyes" singles included the non-album track "Da Lontano".
Both "Open Your Eyes" and "Dimmi Di Sì" were later included in the 2000 career retrospective Personal Jukebox.

[[Master of Ambrass]]
CATEGORIES: Czech painters, Anonymous artists, 14th-century painters

The Master of Ambrass was a Bohemian painter active probably in Prague at the end of the fourteenth century. He was the creator of  the Wiener Musterbuch, a set of silverpoint studies and subjects all dated to the same period, which were used as models in painters' studios. Among the subjects are bust-length images of Christ, the Virgin, various saints, the Crucifixion, and the Annunciation. The pictures are collected in groups of four, affixed to fourteen small framed panels. Three independent designs also exist, depicting a philosopher and astronomer, a sibyl and John the Evangelist, and the Three Magi; these, too, were probably part of the set. Such is the realism of the designs that it is believed the Master had contact with an artist of the Franco-Flemish school. Also attributed to his hand, dubiously, is an Annunciation at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Stylistically, the Master's work bears some similarities to that of the Master of the Pähl Altarpiece. He is sometimes conflated with both the Master of the Gerona Martyrology and the Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece, but this attribution is not universally accepted.

CATEGORIES: Czech painters, Manuscript illuminators, Anonymous artists, 14th-century painters

The Master of the Gerona Martyrology was a Bohemian painter active at the end of the fourteenth century.  His output is fairly poorly known; some historians have conflated him with either the Master of Ambrass or the Master of the Rajhrad Altarpiece.  This view is not universally accepted, and a number of museums have work believed to be by members of his studio, including pieces of illuminated manuscripts.

[[Deep dyslexia]]
CATEGORIES: Alexia (condition), Aphasias, Learning disabilities, Neurological disorders, Reading

Deep dyslexia  is a form of alexia that disrupts reading processes that were functioning normally before the individual suffered a head trauma to the dominant hemisphere (usually left). Deep dyslexia may occur as a result of a head injury, stroke, disease, or operation.[tpl]cite book| last=Harley| first=Trevor A.| title=The psychology of language: from data to theory| publisher=Taylor & Francis| year=2001| pages=189–195| isbn=978-0-86377-867-4 |oclc = 469913878 [/tpl] This injury results in the occurrence of semantic errors during reading and the impairment of nonword reading.[tpl]cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Lori|coauthors=McEwen, Shannon; Westbury, Chris; Libben, Gary|title=Semantics and semantic errors: Implicit access to semantic information from words and nonwords in deep dyslexia|journal=Brain and Language|year=2003|volume=84|issue=1|pages=65–83|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(02)00521-7|accessdate=19 March 2013[/tpl]
The term dyslexia comes from the Greek words ‘dys’ meaning ‘impaired’, and ‘lexis’ meaning ‘word’ and is used to describe disorders of language concerning reading and spelling.
Numerous models and hypotheses have been proposed in attempt to explain the broad range of symptoms experienced by deep dyslexics, but a definite consensus has yet to be reached. The proposed models and hypotheses have helped in treatment of some suffering patients, but only with certain specific symptoms. Additionally, the recovery seen is not experienced equally in all patients.

TAGIBook initiative targets the basic Arab user whether at home, school, university, urban or rural regions.
The TAGIBook initiative, along with other social TAG projects such as community Knowledge Society (TAGKS); aims at increasing literacy levels throughout the Arab world and providing the target population with education and future opportunities based on hard work and merit.
The value of this project is that it does not resemble traditional computer projects, which are present in a number of Arab countries, the difference is that this project specifically addresses the needs of Arab communities, and merges four main components: hardware, software, connectivity, and training. These characteristics result in making this computer project unique in the world.

[[Wolseley Ten]]
CATEGORIES: Wolseley vehicles, Vehicles introduced in 1939

The Wolseley Ten was a light saloon car produced by Wolseley Motors Limited in 1939 and 1945 to 1948 .
The ten horsepower class of cars was an important part of the market in 1930s Britain and Wolseley entered the sector with their 10/40 of 1936 based on the contemporary Morris Ten.  Both Morris and Wolseley were part of the Nuffield Organisation. The 10/40 ceased production in 1937 and it was not until February 1939 that Wolseley introduced a new car the Ten.
The new car was again based on the Morris Ten, this time the 1938 Series M but with an important difference. Whereas the Morris car had a semi unitary construction, the Wolseley had a substantial steel section chassis with cruciform bracing. Many of the steel body pressings were shared. To keep the weight down, the wheelbase at [tpl]convert|90|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] was [tpl]convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] shorter than the Morris.  Suspension was not independent and used semi elliptic leaf springs all round. Lockheed hydraulic drum brakes were fitted. The 1140 cc engine designated XPJW was also slightly more powerful than the one in the Morris delivering [tpl]convert|40|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] as against [tpl]convert|37|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |last=Wood |first=Jonathan |title= Badge Engineering |year=November 1999 |publisher=The Automobile (magazine) |id=ISSN 0955-1328[/tpl]
As the car was intended to compete in the up-market sector, it was well equipped with leather upholstery, pile carpets and walnut trim. The seats were early users of Dunlopillo foam rubber, rather than traditional metal coil springs, possibly the first mass-produced car to use this new material. The steering column was adjustable for both angle and reach. At launch the car was priced at £215, £40 more than the Morris with the option of a built-in Jackall system that could hydraulically lift a wheel off the ground for tyre changing an extra £5.
In June 1939 the saloon was joined by a factory-built two-door drophead coupé priced at £270, but very few seem to have been made. London dealer Eustace Watkins also offered their own drophead version. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, production of Wolseley cars, including the Ten, eventually stopped. 5261 of the model had been made before production ceased in early 1941.[tpl]cite book |last=Sedgwick |first=M. |coauthors= Gillies|title=A-Z of Cars of the 1930s|year=1989 |publisher=Bay View Books |location=Devon, UK |isbn=1-870979-38-9[/tpl]
Production restarted in September 1945 but without the drophead version. the price had risen considerably to £474 (partly due to higher taxes) against the Morris's £378. The Ten was finally dropped in 1948 after 2715 more had been built[tpl]cite book |last=Robson |first=Graham |title=A to Z of British Cars 1945-1980 |year=2000 |publisher=Herridge |location=Devon, UK |isbn=0-9541063-9-3[/tpl] when the first of the post war designs arrived. The new small Wolseley was the 4/50 but with a 1.5 litre engine was a larger car and not a real replacement. With Morris Motors (owners of Wolseley's parent company the Nuffield Organisation) merging with the Austin Motor Company to form the British Motor Corporation in 1952, this sector of the market would be left to Austin and Morris.

Philip Donnellan (9 February 1924 – 15 February 1999) was an English documentary film-maker. 
Described in his Guardian obituary as "one of the greatest of all documentarists", Donnellan worked with the BBC for over four decades, producing around 80 documentary films and programmes, most reflecting working-class lives.
The son of an Irish headmaster, Donnellan grew up in Surrey. After World War II, in which he fought in Burma, he became a journalist, then a BBC radio announcer. He began interviewing working people, such as the fisherman Sam Larner, who had a vast repertoire of traditional songs. The two programmes Donnellan made for the BBC of these songs introduced them to Ewan MacColl. 
From there, Donnellan diversified into television, focusing on working people; his first film was Joe The Chainsmith, and his 1962 Private Faces was a portrait of a Durham miner. He also filmed public figures such as Konrad Adenauer, Jawaharlal Nehru and Charles de Gaulle; these were well received but he found them less satisfying. His continual addressing of political issues led to many editorial disputes, but Donnellan kept his film-making base at Pebble Mill in Birmingham, which meant he could present his films to the BBC controllers as faits accomplis.
Donnellan continued to be entertaining and provocative: Where Do We Go From Here? dealt with the question of the 'Gypsy menace' (travelling people), Gone For A Soldier (1980) was a 105-minute montage of ordinary soldiers' diaries and letters, and he made film versions of the radio ballads Shoals Of Herring (1972), The Fight Game and The Big Hewer (1973) with MacColl and Peggy Seeger. He co-founded and chaired the West Midlands Gypsy Liaison Group.

Flower in the Gun Barrel is a 2008 documentary film focusing on the process of reconciliation and forgiveness in post-genocide Rwanda. The film depicts both the current conditions in Rwanda and the build up to the genocide in 1994. It is unique in that it illustrates the complex challenges of average citizens attempting to forgive the neighbors who slaughtered their families. It is a testament to what human beings are capable of. The topic of forgiveness, and the difficulty of coming to terms with those who have killed one's parents, siblings, children and neighbors, is a universal theme that comes to life through the example of Rwanda.

[[Arthur Storey and the Department of Historical Correction]]

CATEGORIES: BBC Radio programmes, British radio drama

Arthur Storey and the Department of Historical Correction is believed to be BBC radio's first truly interactive radio drama, broadcast live during BBC7’s Big Toe Radio Show between 14 November and 18 November 2005. The series incorporated characters and plot suggestions phoned, texted, faxed and e-mailed by young listeners. 
With the exception of the first episode, which established the main characters and the Department of Historical Correction (founded to return historical characters appearing in the present through temporal rifts to ‘their right time and place’), each episode was written in a hotel room overnight by author Philip Ardagh, incorporating as many of the listeners’ ideas as was feasible. The script was then discussed between Ardagh, producer Nicky Grishotti and director Paul Arnold the following morning, in time for any rewrites and tweaks before the actors arrived for a mid-morning run-through.
These episodes were then performed live in the Big Toe studio -- including the music -- after which Ardagh took calls and comments from listeners. Each episode was then replayed near the conclusion of each show to encourage further ideas. As the week progressed, more and more of the show was given over to listener feedback live on air.
The idea of an interactive show of this type was Paul Arnold’s and he and Nicky Grishoti came up with the title ‘Arfur Story’ the idea being that the listener had to ‘provide the other arf’. Ardagh added flesh to the bones by creating The Department of Historical Correction, the idea being that familiar characters could be easily introduced without the need for ‘back story’. (“Everyone knows who Florence Nightingale is, so once her name is suggested, she can become a part of the action.”) He also tweaked the hero’s name to Arthur Storey.
Though questioning whether memorable drama could be made by committee, Paul Donovan of The Sunday Times described Arthur Storey as "a live daily serial about time travel, based on fantastical suggestions (“Mary, Queen of Scots hits Albert Einstein over the head with a frying pan”) sent in by Big Toe’s core audience of 8- to 12-year-olds and hammered into shape by the children’s author Philip Ardagh. ... The truly original feature of BBC7’s serial was that its listeners, not the professional writer, determined both the fate of the characters and the outcome. It was all utter nonsense, like a game of consequences, fun and fast ..."[tpl]Fact|date=May 2008[/tpl]

Matthias Klostermayr, known as Bavarian Hiasl (in German Bayerische Hiasl, in Austro-Bavarian Boarische Hiasl) (3 September 1736—6 September 1771) was a renowned German outlaw, poacher and social rebel who had come to be described, particularly in accounts written in the English-speaking world, as the Bavarian Robin Hood.
A native of the municipality of Kissing near Augsburg (his name, in Austro-Bavarian, on the baptismal register is Mattheus Klostermair), Bavarian Hiasl became an outlaw, first as a poacher and ultimately as the Robin Hood-like leader of a gang of robbers who, during the 1760s, plundered, sacked and robbed in the region between Munich, Augsburg and Swabia. Although, by 1771, he was captured and put to death by breaking wheel, his mythical accumulated treasure was never found, and legends surrounding its purported whereabouts have placed it somewhere near one of his hideouts, an old cave in Kuchelschlag Wood or on Jexhof Farm.
In Bavaria he has been a folk hero, with books, songs, musicals and a modern multimedia museum in Kissing ("Hiasl Erlebniswelt", or "the World of Hiasl"), which recreates for visitors the life and times of the "German prince of forests", the "Bavarian Robin Hood", whose gruesome execution took place in Dillingen an der Donau. Ten years later, in 1781, Friedrich Schiller is presumed to have based Karl Moor, the tragic protagonist of his first play, The Robbers, on the Bavarian Hiasl who, in the 2000s, nearly 250 years after his death, still captures the imagination.

Georg Friedrich Strass ([tpl]lang-fr|Georges Frédéric Strass[/tpl]; 29 May 1701, Wolfisheim bei Strasbourg - 22 December 1773) was an Alsatian jeweler and inventor of imitation gemstones. He is best known as the inventor of the rhinestone, called strass in many European languages, from a particular type of glass he found in the river Rhine.
He used mixtures of bismuth and thallium to improve the refractive quality of his imitations, and altered their colors with metal salts. The imitations were, in his view, so similar to real gems that he invented the concept of the "simulated gemstone" to describe them. He considerably improved his gems' brilliance by gluing metal foil behind them. This foil was later replaced with a vapor-deposited mirror coating.
Strass opened his own business in 1730, and devoted himself wholly to the development of imitation diamonds. Due to his great achievements, he was awarded the title "King's Jeweler" in 1734.
He was a partner in the jewellery business of Madame Prévot. He continued improving his artificial gemstones during this time. His work was in great demand at the court of King Louis XV of France, and he controlled a large market for artificial gems.
Wealthy through his businesses, he was able to retire comfortably at age 52.

The Military Service Act 1916 was an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom during the First World War.  It was the first time that legislation had been passed in British military history introducing conscription.  
The Bill which became the Act was introduced by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in January 1916. It came into force on 2 March 1916. Previously the British Government had relied on voluntary enlistment, and latterly a kind of moral conscription called the Derby Scheme.
The Act specified that men from 18 to 41 years old were liable to be called up for service in the army unless they were married, widowed with children, serving in the Royal Navy, a minister of religion, or working in one of a number of reserved occupations. A second Act in May 1916 extended liability for military service to married men, and a third Act in 1918 extended the upper age limit to 51.
Men or employers who objected to an individual's call-up could apply to a local Military Service Tribunal.  These bodies could grant exemption from service, usually conditional or temporary. There was right of appeal to a County Appeal Tribunal.

In Canadian history, the Military Service Act was a 1917 act passed by the Canadian parliament in an effort to recruit more soldiers. The First World War was going badly, casualties were enormous, and Canada's contribution in manpower compared unfavourably with that of other countries. Voluntary enlistment had been uneven, and the military believed they could not maintain the Canadian Corps at full strength without conscription. Encouraged by English Canadians and the British, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden introduced the Military Service Act. Riots broke out in Quebec. The act was unevenly administered, and there were numerous evasions and many exemptions. By the end of the war only 24,132 conscripts had reached the front. The act's military value has been questioned, but its political consequences are clear. It led to Borden's Union government and drove most of his French Canadian supporters into opposition, as they were seriously alienated by this attempt to enforce their participation in an imperial war.Military Service Act - The Canadian Encyclopedia On April 20, 1918, an order-in-council was passed that removed exemptions from the Military Service Act. This left farming operations across Canada short of much-needed labour.

The Military Training Act 1939 was an Act of Parliament passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 26 May 1939, in a period of international tension that led to World War II. The Act applied to males aged 20 and 21 years old who were to be called up for six months full-time military training, and then transferred to the Reserve. There was provision for conscientious objectors. It was the UK's first act of peacetime conscription and was intended to be temporary in nature, continuing for three years unless an Order in Council declared it was no longer necessary.
On 27 April 1939, Leslie Hore-Belisha, Secretary of State for War, persuaded the cabinet of Neville Chamberlain to introduce a limited form of conscription as a result of the deteriorating international situation and the rise of Nazi Germany.
Men called up were to be known as 'militiamen' to distinguish them from the regular army. To emphasise this distinction, each man was issued with a suit in addition to a uniform. The intention was for the first intake to undergo six months of basic training before being discharged into an active reserve. They would then be recalled for short training periods and attend annual camps.
There was one registration under the Act, of the first cohort of liable males, on Saturday 3 June 1939, and call-up for these men followed. However, the Act was superseded on the outbreak of war in September 1939 by the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939.

The National Service Act 1948 was an Act of Parliament which extended the British conscription of World War II into peacetime, in the form of National Service. After a first version of the act had been approved in 1947, to be implemented 1 January 1949, the Cold War and the Malayan Emergency caused a revised and extended version to be approved in December 1948, only days before it came into force.[tpl]cite web|title=National Service – History|publisher=British Armed Forces and National Service|url=http://www.britisharmedforces.org/ns/nat_history.htm|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011[/tpl]
The act was a modified version of the National Service Act of September, 1939, which it superseeded, and mainly aimed to address whether National Service would continue after the war. The National Service Act of September 1939 did not address this issue.
The National Service Act 1948 applied to all healthy young males who were not registered as conscientious objectors, as it did not affect neither the exemption for, nor the possibility to register as, conscientious objectors.

[[Göta highway]]
CATEGORIES: Roads in Sweden

Göta highway  (Swedish: Göta landsväg) was the only road between Stockholm and south of Sweden. Dating back at least to the middle ages, and some parts even back to the Viking Age, the highway is the oldest known road from Stockholm to the south. Göta highway lost importance after the year 1670, when the new highway via Hornstull came in use.
Göta highway started in the centre of Stockholm at the Old Castle of Stockholm in Gamla Stan and led through Södermalm (here, the street is now named Götgatan) and the south suburbs of the city via the present-day Huddinge Municipality, Botkyrka Municipality and Salem Municipality to the city of Södertälje, and then further on to Götaland, one of the three lands of Sweden.
Portions of the highway as it once was, have been saved to posterity in only a few places. For example, it can be seen crossing the Årsta field (Årstafältet) in Enskede-Årsta, south of Södermalm. On Årsta field there is a 900 meter long part of Göta landsväg, and where it passed the Valla brook there is a stone-arched bridge that was built in the 18th or 19th century. It originally was a wade or a simpler wooden bridge. Since long in ruins, it was restored in 1998 after a model of a similar bridge on another part of the highway in  Botkyrka. The Göta highway on Årsta field is an ancient monument.

Viburnum lantanoides (also called Hobblebush,  Witch-hobble, and Moosewood) is a perennial shrub of the family Adoxaceae growing 2–4 meters (6–12 ft) high with pendulous branches that take root where they touch the ground.  These rooted branches form obstacles which easily trip (or hobble) walkers – hence the common name.
The shrub forms large clusters of white to pink flowers in May–June. The flowers on the outer edge of the clusters are much larger (3–5 cm across). The whole cluster is typically 10 cm across. It has large, cardioid leaves which are serrate, 10–20 cm long.  The bark is gray-brown and warty and the fruit is a drupe which is red, turning to black when ripened.
The flowers provide nectar for the Celastrina ladon (Spring Azure) butterfly.  Mammals and birds feed on its fruit, twigs, and leaves.  The large showy flowers along the edge of the cluster are sterile, while the small inner flowers have both male and female parts.http://www.usanpn.org/Viburnum_lantanoides

Computerman are a four piece indie synthpop band from Nottingham, although they are often referred to as a Leicester band due to two members heralding from rural South Leicestershire. They released their debut single with Must Destroy Records[tpl]Cite news | title = Computerman | periodical = BBC | publication-date = 2005-12-13 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/12/09/computerman_interview_feature.shtml | postscript = [/tpl] (once home to The Darkness and Do Me Bad Things) and have completed two national tours of the United Kingdom, including supporting Bristol's The Fallout Trust on their February 2006 tour. 
Formed from the ashes of two Leicester bands Carolgees and The Martells, Computerman released their debut single 'No More Broken Hearts / Watch More Television' in December 2005 which entered the Indie Singles chart at number 28 under the London label, 'Must Destroy'. A super-limited 10" remix of 'Watch More Television' was released in March 2006. The band's second single proper 'All Runways' was intended to follow in May 2006, with a promotional video, final mixes, artwork and a remix by label-mates Colon Openbracket being produced. However, the single was delayed and the band commenced work on their debut album. 
Computerman began recording sessions for their first studio album late in 2006. The working title was 'Death Of The Great Romantic'. Rob Crich, guitarist and keyboard player, left the band on January 30, 2007, having completed his contribution to the album sessions. Mixing of the album was completed during May 2008 following a long hiatus for the band, during which time Adam Pickering also joined Leicester band Minnaars.
Following a period of uncertainty the band decided to call it a day and never released the album, although some tracks have been circulated online.
The band hope to release the album for download at some stage in the future and play a show to draw a line under the final chapter of Computerman.

 Packera plattensis, also known as prairie ragwort or prairie groundsel is a species of the genus Packera and family Asteraceae.  It used to be a Senecio.
Prairie Groundsel is found throughout the tallgrass prairie region, and it is one of the earliest flowering prairie wildflowers.  It is easily confused with golden ragwort or Packera aurea which has a hairless stem and heart-shaped basal leaves, and Senecio integerrimus, which has leaves that are mostly entire instead of fern-like, and much larger basal leaves.Sylvan T.

Aviadvigatel OJSC (Russian: ОАО "Авиадвигатель", lit. Aeromover) is a developer and builder of aero-engines for  Ilyushin Il-76MF, Ilyushin Il-96, Tupolev Tu-204, Tupolev Tu-214, and other aircraft.  It also designs and builds  high-efficiency gas turbine units for  electric power stations and for gas pumping plants.
Perm Motors Joint Stock Company (JSC), the founder of Perm motor constructors, was founded June 1, 1934  when an engine design and manufacturing factory was built at Perm Krai, Russia. The factory was originally known as OKB-19 - Soloviev, or the  Soloviev Design Bureau.OKB is the Russian acronym for "Опытное конструкторское бюро" - Opytnoe Konstructorskoe Byuro, meaning Experimental Design Bureau.
The firm was headed by Arkady Dmitrievich Shvetsov from its foundation date in 1939. Starting in early 1950s the Company was headed by Pavel Alexandrovich Soloviev, Mr.Shvetsov's successor, and was engaged in development of new gas turbine engines. Since 1989, and up to June, 2001, with a break in 1995-1997, the enterprise was headed by Yuri Evgenievich Reshetnikov. 
The first engine to be built at OKB-19 was a licensed variant of the Wright R-1820-F3 Cyclone 9, designated the Shvetsov M-25 radial engine. Other Shevtsoy designed piston engines produced at OKB-19 were the M-11, M-71 ASh-2, ASh-21, ASh-62, ASh-73 and ASh-82. In just four years OKB-19 was Russia's major manufacturer of aircraft engines.
During World War II the Plant exceeded its original design capacity by a factor of 12, producing more than 32,000 engines for Lavochkin La-5, Sukhoi Su-2 and Tupolev Tu-2s. In the 1950s the factory transitioned from piston engines to jet engines. The Plant has consolidated its positions and has become a regular partner and supplier of products for  Tupolev, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Mil, and Myasishchev.
Perm Engine Company was established in 1997 as a subsidiary of Perm Motors Company inheriting the gas turbine production facility and the rich traditions of the largest company of the West Ural. In June 2001 Alexander A. Inozemtsev, General Designer, became the General Director of  Aviadvigatel Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC).  Starting in October 2006 he was the Managing Director & General Designer.
In October 2003, "Perm Motors Group Management Company" was established to: 1) coordinate the corporative relations and management of the Perm Motors Group companies, 2) resolve strategic marketing matters 3)  investment planning.
"Aviadvigatel" OJSC was merged into the Perm Engine Company, Perm Motors Group.Aviadvigatel's history
The company currently offers several versions of the Aviadvigatel PS-90 engine that powers Ilyushin Il-96-300, -400, T, Tupolev Tu-204, Tu-214 series and the Ilyushin Il-76-MD-90. The modification PS-90A-76 is instaled on Ilyushin Il-76 military and commercial transport airplanes. There are two modern variants of the PS-90A:
The company is currently developing the new Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine for the new Russian Irkut MS-21 airliner.

CATEGORIES: Alkaloids found in Apocynaceae, Chemical nomenclature

Ajmalan is a parent hydride used in the IUPAC nomenclature of natural products and also in CAS nomenclature.[tpl]IUPAC natural products 1999[/tpl]. It is a 20-carbon alkaloid with six rings and seven chiral centres.
The name is derived from ajmaline, an antiarrhythmic alkaloid isolated from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentinaSiddiqui, S.; Siddiqui, R. H. (1931). J. Indian Chem. Soc. 8: 667–80. which is formally a dihydroxy-derivative of ajmalan. The –an ending indicates that ajmalan is partially saturated. Ajmaline itself is named after Hakim Ajmal Khan, a distinguished practitioner of the Unani school of traditional medicine in South Asia.Ahmed Nasim Sandilvi (2003). "Salimuzzaman Siddiqui: pioneer of scientific research in Pakistan." Daily Dawn, 2003-04-12. Retrieved on 2007-07-19.
The absolute configuration of the seven chiral carbon atoms in ajmalan is defined by convention, as is the numbering system. The stereochemistry is the same as that in naturally-occurring ajmaline, and corresponds to (2R,3S,5S,7S,15S,16R,20S) using conventional numbering.
Ajmalan can be systematically named as
or as
Note that the numbering of the atoms in the systematic names is different from the conventional numbering of ajmalan.The numbering is also different between the von Baeyer name and the fusion name, given the different conventions which apply to the two methods of nomenclature.
The ajmalan skeleton is similar to those of certain other alkaloids, and ajmalan could also be given the following semisystematic names:
However, the relative complexity even of these names justifies the use of ajmalan as a defined parent hydride in alkaloid nomenclature.

Its rendering method was similar to that of FPrime in that it displayed a continuously refined rendered image until final production quality image was achieved. This differs to traditional rendering methods where the rendered image is built up block-by-block.
It was developed by Holomatix Ltd, based in London, UK. As of December 2011, the Rendition product has been retired and is no longer available or being updated. The product is no longer mentioned on the developer's web site, either. The successor is SprayTrace.

Arthur Frederick Dicks (1935–1994) was a designer working in the field of theatre and dance, as well as an accomplished actor and artist. He became the first head of design at NIDA, (National Institute of Dramatic Art) in Australia.
Born in London, Dicks lived through the Blitz, and was eventually rehoused in the country when his home was destroyed. In his teens he became involved in repertory theatre and acted with Laurence Olivier and Judi Dench; some of these actors he stayed in contact with for the rest of his life. As well as working on his drama skills, he began work as an artist for a prestigious advertising agency.
He decided to travel in his twenties and ended up in New York where he went to work for a leading fashion magazine. An assignment in Louisiana in 1951 led to his taking a yearlong break in New Orleans, living in the Pontalba Apartments and a friend's plantation house at White Castle, where he began a series of travel painted diaries.
By the mid-1950s he was back in London where he signed up with the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was assigned to bomb disposal and sent to Iraq. Again he did many detailed drawings and photos of his travels.
After the RAF, Dicks returned to London where he married and returned to the theatre.  Both he and his wife acted all over the United Kingdom. They also had a daughter.  He often not only acted but was involved in designing the sets and costumes. This new direction saw him working as a set and costume designer in England, USA and Africa, spending some time in Nairobi.
By the mid-1960s Dicks arrived in Hollywood with introductions to David Niven and the English set of actors. He quickly started work with designer Bill Travilla and liaised with Edith Head on two productions as well. By now he had two daughters, but his wife and children returned to London.

Sister Paula González, S.C., Ph.D., (born 1932) entered the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati in 1954. She earned her doctorate in biology at the Catholic University in Washington, DC, and was a biology professor at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, Ohio, for 21 years. 
Since 1972, Sister Paula has been freelancing as a futurist and environmentalist, working for more than three decades to promote sustainable living. She supported the work of the Alternate Energy Association of Southwestern Ohio, including serving as president for a while. She has developed audiotape courses in Earth-healing; has written several articles and book chapters on ecospirituality, conservation, renewable energy, and spiritual ecology; and has reached thousands in person by giving over 1800 presentations.
Sister Paula designed and did much of the work of converting a former chicken barn into "La Casa del Sol," a [tpl]convert|1200|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] super-insulated, passive-solar house she shares with another Sister of Charity. When the temperature dropped below zero in the winter of 1985, the home temperature dropped to no lower than 50 degrees without any heater running. Sister Paula's success with solar energy earned her the nickname "Solar Nun."
Sister Paula founded EarthConnection, an environmental learning center where tours, internships, and environmental educational programs have been conducted. Located on the grounds of her congregation’s motherhouse, the EarthConnection Center was completed in 1995 and continues to showcase various renewable-energy technologies including daylighting, passive and active solar thermal, grid-tied photovoltaic, and geoexchange energy systems. The systems are not only impressive in their variety, but also notable for the unusual "solar-assisted geothermal" configuration, where summer heat is transferred from solar thermal collectors to an insulated bed of earth around the building for use the following winter.
The American Solar Energy Society's Ohio Chapter, Green Energy Ohio, gave Sister Paula their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. 
In 2007, Sister Paula and Keith Mills founded Ohio Interfaith Power and Light, a coalition of religious people responding to the climate-change crisis. Ohio Interfaith Power and Light is an affiliate of The Regeneration Project's national Interfaith Power and Light campaign, which has programs in 26 states involving over 4000 congregations (as of May 2008).

The Pictish Free State was a micronation initiative started by Brian Robertson AKA Robbie the Pict in 1977. Apparently created to further knowledge of Pictish culture, Robertson started the project with one acre of his own land on the Isle of Skye. Since then the Pictish Free State has grown to over [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl] through supporters donations. Robbie, under 'Pictish High Commission' auspices, has in the past been in conflict with HM Government over his use of Pictish diplomatic registration plates and non-compliance with UK laws.http://www.highlanderweb.co.uk/robpict.htm
For a time in the early 1990s Robbie was to be found in Tallinn, Estonia where he sought political asylum. Robbie ultimately felt that he had been undermined by the influence of MI6 on the serving Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trivimi Velliste, to prevent a scenario of his being created a cause célèbre by the official granting of political asylum status - Robbie held, and still holds the belief, that Velliste's Soviet past cast a shadow on his ability to escape compromise by informed intelligence services.
Robertson was a candidate for Member of the European Parliament in 1999. He had a website.

For many years the line was owned by major railway operator Kintetsu but control was transferred to Sangi in 2003.
At Kuwana Station, a short walk from Nishi-Kuwana Station, passengers can transfer to the Kansai Main Line, the Kintetsu Nagoya Line, and the Yōrō Line.
The name Hokusei (北勢) means "northern Mie".  It is a kanji abbreviation of "north" (北) and "Ise" (伊勢).  Ise (as opposed to "Mie") is used in the name because the northern and central parts of present-day Mie Prefecture were called Ise Province during the Edo era before the modern prefecture system was established; it is common for regional companies like railways to use these old province names.

CATEGORIES: Digenea, Animals described in 1906, Parasites of equines, Parasites of mammals

Schistosoma indicum is a species of digenetic trematode in the family Schistosomatidae. The parasite is widespread in domestic animals in India and other Asian countries.
Schistosoma indicum was discovered by the British scientist R. E. Montgomery,[tpl]cite journal|last=Montgomery|first=R. E.|title=Observations on Bilharziosis among animals in India. I|journal=Journal of Tropical Veterinary Science|year=1906|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–46|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Journal_of_Tropical_Veterinary_Science.html?id=sK8XAAAAYAAJ[/tpl]  in 1906, from a horse from Mukteswar, Uttar Pradesh, India. This blood-fluke causes hepato-intestinal schistosomiasis in many domestic animals (sheep, goat, water buffalo, cattle, camel, horse, donkey, dog, but not pigs).[tpl]Cite doi|10.1186/1756-3305-3-57[/tpl] It was responsible for an outbreak of pulmonary schistosomiasis, in 1981, in sheep in Rajasthan, leading to considerable mortality. S.indicum caused considerable mortality in the sheep flocks in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka but it was misdiagnosed as Rinder Pest,[tpl]cite journal|last=Chandra|first=D|coauthors=Singh KP, Singh R, Samanta S and Rasool AR|title=Schistosomiasis in sheep flocks in southern states of India|journal=Journal of Veterinary Pathology|year=2003|volume=27|pages=93–94[/tpl] highlighting the problem of proper diagnosis of the infection in domestic animals. S.indicum has been detected from almost all the states of India and  is more wide spread than Schistosoma spindale.[tpl]cite book|last=Agrawal|first=Mahesh Chandra |title=Schistosomes and Schistosomiasis in South Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xD6XJaDiWPEC|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-81-322-0539-5[/tpl]
The parasite's most important intermediate host is a freshwater snail Indoplanorbis exustus[tpl]cite book|last=Srivatava|first=HD|title=Studies on Schistosoma indicum. Research Series No. 34|year=1962|publisher=Indian Council of Agricultural Research|url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19642203373.html;jsessionid=ABE7A55259808C8DE8E5D397E2508667|coauthors=Dutt SC[/tpl]  that is the sole natural intermediate host for S. indicum (and other two Schistosoma species) on the Indian sub-continent. Earlier another snail (Lymnaea luteola) was also implicated in transmission of S. indicum, but subsequent research refuted that possibility.
A variant of S. indicum, rather than Schistosoma haematobium, was suggested to be responsible for human schistosomiasis in Gimvi village, Ratnagiri district, India,[tpl]cite journal|last=Gaitonde|first=BB|coauthors=Sathe BD, Mukerji S, Sutar NK, Athalye RP, Kotwal BP and Renapurkar DM|title=Studies on schistosomiasis in village Gimvi of Maharashtra|journal=Indian Journal of Medical Research|year=1981|volume=74|pages=352–357[/tpl] but was later disputed by other scientists. The main reasons were the use of a different intermediate host (Ferrissia tenuis) and final host (man) with difference in location (urinary system) which is not possible for any variant.  Terminal-spined S. indicum-like eggs have been detected in human stools. Dr. M. C. Agrawal demonstrated cross-immunity against Schistosoma incognitum by immunising the host against S. indicum.

In mathematical analysis, and especially functional analysis, a fundamental role is played by the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with values in the real or complex numbers.  This space, denoted by C(X), is a vector space with respect to the pointwise addition of functions and scalar multiplication by constants.  It is, moreover, a normed space with norm defined by
the uniform norm.  The uniform norm defines the topology of uniform convergence of functions on X.  The space C(X) is a Banach algebra with respect to this norm. [tpl]harv|Rudin|1973|loc=§11.3[/tpl]

He spent the rest of his career in minor league baseball, including nine seasons (1939–1947) in the highly competitive Pacific Coast League for the Sacramento Solons (1939–1940) and San Francisco Seals (1941–1947).
Ogrodowski's 119 Major League hits included 25 doubles, four triples and four home runs. After managing in the farm systems of the Boston Braves and St. Louis Browns, Ogrodowski died at age 44 in San Francisco, California.

The 2008–09 season was Newcastle United's 16th consecutive season in the top division of English football. This season saw the club relegated from the Premier League to the Championship, the first time the club had been relegated since 1989.
Things had looked reasonable for Newcastle at the start of the new season, but a major falling out between Kevin Keegan and the board saw Keegan resign as manager. This led to an awful run of form under caretaker manager Chris Hughton and the surprise appointment of Joe Kinnear was made to try to help the team out. A health scare saw Kinnear have to leave his office as manager in February. Under Hughton and Colin Calderwood, the club went on another horrible run of form as they were sucked deeper into the relegation battle. Ex-player Alan Shearer was appointed as a temporary manager for the last 8 matches of the season but he was only able to win one of these games and Newcastle were relegated.

[[Ælfflæd, wife of Edward the Elder]]
CATEGORIES: 10th-century English people, 9th-century women, 10th-century women, Anglo-Saxon royal consorts, House of Wessex

Ælfflæd (fl. early 10th century) was the second wife of Edward the Elder, king of the Anglo-Saxons from 899 to 924.
Ælfflæd was the daughter of an ealdorman Æthelhelm, probably ealdorman Æthelhelm of Wiltshire who died in 897. Genealogist David H. Kelley and historian Pauline Stafford have identified him as Æthelhelm, a son of Edward's uncle, King Ethelred I.Stafford, pp. 324-325Kelley, pp. 63-93 Other historians have rejected the idea, arguing that it does not appear to have been the practice for Æthelings (princes of the royal dynasty who were eligible to be king) to become ealdormen, that in a grant from King Alfred to Ealdorman Æthelhelm there is no reference to kinship between them, and that the hostile reception to King Eadwig's marriage to Ælfgifu, his third cousin once removed, shows that a marriage between Edward and his first cousin once removed would have been forbidden as incestuous.Yorke, pp. 33-34; Foot, 2011, p. 37 n. 25
Ælfflæd married King Edward around 899. She only attested one charter, dated 901, where she was described as conjux regis. She never attested as queen. and although she was previously thought to have been consecrated as queen when Edward was crowned in 900, this is now thought unlikely.Foot, 2011, pp. 11, 37 n. 26 In 1827 the tomb of St Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral was opened, and among the objects found were a stole and manciple which had inscriptions showing that they had been commissioned by Ælfflæd for bishop Frithestan of Winchester. However, they had been donated by her step-son king Æthelstan to Cuthbert's tomb, probably in 934.Foot, 2011, pp. 121-123
Ælfflæd had two sons, Ælfweard, who became king of Wessex on his father's death in 924 but died himself within a month, and Edwin, who was drowned in 933. She also had five or six daughters, including Eadgifu, wife of Charles the Simple, king of West Francia, Eadhild, who married Hugh the Great, duke of the Franks, and Eadgyth, wife of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor.Foot, 2011 pp. xv, 38, 41, 44 In around 967 Hrotsvitha, a nun of Gandersheim, wrote a eulogy of the deeds of Otto I in which she contrasted the nobility of Eadgyth's mother with the inferior descent of Æthelstan's mother.Foot, 2011, p. 30
Edmund I, the future king who was a son of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu, was born in 920 or 921, so Ælfflæd's marriage must have ended in the late 910s. According to William of Malmesbury, Edward put aside Ælfflæd in order to marry Eadgifu, a claim which Sean Miller viewed sceptically,Miller, Edward the Elder but it is accepted by other historians.Williams, Ælfflæd; Sharp, p. 82; Foot, 2010, p. 243 She is reported to have retired to Wilton Abbey, where she was joined by two of her daughters, Eadflæd and Æthelhild, and all three were buried there.Sharp, p. 82; Foot, 2011, p. 45

The Chiefdoms of Sierra Leone are the third-level units of administration in Sierra Leone. The paramount chiefs and the ruling families in the chiefdoms were recognized and empowered by the British colonial administration when it organized the Protectorate of Sierra Leone in 1896.Tristan Reed and James A. Robinson, The Chiefdoms of Sierra Leone, Scholar, Harvard University, 15 July 2013, Document available online, accessed 30 April 2014 Typically, chiefs have the power to "raise taxes, control the judicial system, and allocate land, the most important resource in rural areas."
The hereditary paramount chiefs and their sub-chiefs have effectively been the sole local government in Sierra Leone until 2004, when the World Bank sponsored creation of elected local councils. Local notables, known as the Tribal Authority, elect paramount chiefs for life from among the ruling families in each chieftaincy recognized by the British administration in 1896. Some chieftaincies have several ruling families, and the differences among them in terms of economic progress has been subject to study in 2013.Daron Acemoglu, Tristan Reed. and James A. Robinson. "Chiefs: Economic Development and Elite Control of Civil Society in Sierra Leone", Stanford University, 29 August 2013, accessed 30 April 2014 They found there was a positive relationship between the number of ruling families in a chieftaincy and educational, health and economic outcomes in terms of human capital.Acemoglu et al.

CATEGORIES: Etymology, English language

In lexicography, antedating means finding earlier citations of a particular term than those already known.James Gleick: Cyber-Neologoliferation. The Oxford English Dictionary meets Cyberspace, New York Times Magazine, 5 November 2006
Historical dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary provide citations meant to show the evolution of every word, beginning with the earliest known usage. Antedating is a key task in lexicography and a popular sport. By indicating limitations of dictionaries they raise important questions of the consistency of editorial policies and the exhaustiveness and accuracy of dictionary material. The issue has thus been addressed in several major studies as well as in hundreds of papers tracing individual words, some of which are by-products of historical or linguistic research.Mirosława Podhajecka: Antedating headwords in the third edition of the OED: Findings and problems
Similar activities are postdating (finding more recent evidence of words than is currently quoted) and interdating (intermediate evidence where large gaps in dating evidence exist).Oxford English Dictionary homepage: Contribute to the OED
To encourage and facilitate this process, dedicated submission forms are available on the internetOxford University Press homepage: OED Submission Form and regular appeals to the public for investigation are being made.Oxford English Dictionary homepage: About the OED Appeals The appeal Wordhunt was part of the TV show Balderdash and Piffle on BBC.

[[Lex Agraria]]

CATEGORIES: Roman law

The Lex Agraria can refer to a Roman law proposed in 133 BC during the Tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus. The law involved the redistribution of public land, previously owned by the Senatorial class, to the lower classes in Ancient Rome, using money bequeathed to Rome in the will of Attalus III of Pergamum to purchase the land and provide resources with which the Plebieans could start lives farming the land rather than suffering from debt and unemployment in the city. The law was most unpopular with the upper classes, and as a result of this, plus various other factors, Gracchus was murdered by a group of Senators later in the year. However, the law was passed that same year as a result of heavy pressure on the Senate from the Roman populace.
The "Lex Agraria" can also refer to a law passed in 111 BC between March 15 and the harvest season.Roman Statutes edited by M.H. Crawford. London: University of London 1996 pg. 55 This statute recognized the land claims made in Italy, Africa, and Greece since the earlier Lex Agraria of 133 BC.Johnson, Coleman-Norton & Bourne, Ancient Roman Statutes, Austin, 1961, pp. 50-57, n. 51

The Lex Cornelia de Maiestate was a Roman law passed by Sulla during his dictatorship from 81 to 80 BC using the tribune Cornelius.
The law, relating to the control of governors and their forces in the provinces, stated among other things that a governor could not leave his province during his time in office, with or without his army.
The Law was designed to prevent both corruption and rebellion of governors, but was thwarted just 4 years later in 77 BC during the revolt of Lepidus, a rogue proconsul who left his province of Cisalpine Gaul with his army and marched towards Rome.

[[Margin classifier]]
CATEGORIES: Classification algorithms, Statistical classification

In machine learning, a margin classifer is a classifier which is able to give an associated distance from the decision boundary for each example.  For instance, if a linear classifier (e.g. perceptron or linear discriminant analysis) is used, the distance (typically euclidean distance, though others may be used) of an example from the separating hyperplane is the margin of that example.
The notion of margin is important in several machine learning classification algorithms, as it can be used to bound the generalization error of the classifier.  These bounds are frequently shown using the VC dimension.  Of particular prominence is the generalization error bound on boosting algorithms and support vector machines.

CATEGORIES: 1982 novels, American fantasy novels, Works published under a pseudonym

As it is Written is an Oriental fantasy novel by pulp writer De Lysle Ferrée Cass mistakenly republished under the name of Weird Tales writer Clark Ashton Smith.  It was first published in 1982 by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in an edition of 1,250 copies (1200 of which were for sale), all of which were signed by the illustrator, R.J. Krupowicz. The book includes an introduction by Will Murray and an afterword by Donald Sidney-Fryer.  The novel was discovered in the files of The Thrill Book magazine, where it had been accepted in 1919, by Murray and Daryl S. Herrick.
Based on various evidence including handwriting and typewriter comparisons, and similarities of subject matter and style, they believed the novel to be the work of Clark Ashton Smith using Cass as a pseudonym.  Murray showed the manuscript to Donald M. Grant and Sidney-Fryer who both agreed it to be the work of Smith.  It was only after Grant published the novel that the attribution to Smith was discovered to be spurious.
Murray has speculated that Smith and Cass may have come into correspondence Murray, Will. "As It Was Not Written, or The Curious Conundrum of De Lysle Ferrée Cass".

CATEGORIES: 1908 births, 1978 deaths, American jazz trombonists

Alton "Slim" Moore (1908-1978) was an American jazz trombonist.
Moore began on baritone horn before settling on trombone by age 17. He played with local bandleaders and territory bands in his youth, such as those of Georgia Barlowe, Eddie Lemon, Gonzelle White, and Gene Coy. He moved to New York City early in the 1930s, playing with Jack Butler, Charlie Skeete, and Bobby Neal. He switched ensembles frequently in New York, and in 1938 did a short tour of Cuba with Leon Gross's orchestra. Toward the end of the decade Moore moved up to play in more high-profile bands such as those of Fats Waller, Coleman Hawkins, Hot Lips Page, and Charlie Johnson. He played with Ella Fitzgerald and Benny Carter in the early 1940s, and with Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong later in the decade.
By the 1950s Moore had reduced to part-time playing, after an extended stay in the band of Stafford "Pazuza" Simon. He played with Fletcher Henderson in 1957, and in the 1960s played in the Prince Hall Symphonic Band in New York as well as other big band revival outfits.
In addition to trombone, Moore also occasionally recorded on trumpet, tuba, euphonium, and did some scat singing on his records with Fats Waller.

Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov ([tpl]lang-ru|Никола́й Евге́ньевич Ма́рков[/tpl]), known as Markov II or Markov the Second ([tpl]lang-ru|Марков Второй[/tpl])Because he was the younger of two Duma members named Markov. (2 April 1866-25 April 1945, Wiesbaden),Марков Николай Евгеньевич (1866-1945) by Roman Romov [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] was a Russian right wing political figure who was a leading figure in the Union of the Russian People (UPR).
Born in Kursk, Markov came from a land-owning background but was also a trained engineer. He entered politics in 1905 when he formed a defence group for the upper middle classes called the Party of Civil Order, whilst also starting the journals Kurskaia Byl and Zemschchina.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 255 He became a founder of the UPR and was noted as its most formidable leader, using his membership of the State Duma of the Russian Empire to attack both capitalism and socialism, as well as launching frequent attacks on the Jews, whom he predicted would be wiped out in a mass pogrom. In 1911, during the discussions of the draft of the new Statute on Military Service he launched an attack on Jews in the military service, recommending the removal of Jews from the militaryYohanan Petrovsky-Shtern, "The "Jewish Policy" of the Late Imperial War Ministry: The Impact of the Russian Right", in "Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 3.2 (2002) pp. 217-254" - "The Talmud provides us with innumerable passages that make clear how observant Jews should avoid the fulfillment of any promise or any oath. The Jews mock and jeer at oaths. Now, if a soldier does not respect an oath, violates an oath, and even considers that his religious cult approves his scorn of an oath, it is obvious that we can get nothing but evil from him... It is shocking that the War Ministry hesitates to cut this sore out of the noble pure body of the Imperial Russian Army."
He became URP leader in 1910 following the departure of Aleksandr Dubrovin and his followers and took over editorship of the pro-Vladimir Purishkevich journal Vestnik Soyuza Russkogo Naroda. He used his position to argue for a restoration of absolutism and in the First World War supported a separate peace treaty between Russia and Germany, even attempting to get the Germans involved in a conspiracy to save the House of Romanov after the revolutions.
He fled to Germany following the October Revolution and set up the émigré Russian Monarchist Union, although he became more associated with the far right of the monarchist movement when he expressed his admiration for Italian fascism. He conspired to have Cyril of Coburg crowned Tsar, a man whose wife, Viktoria Feodorovna, was close to far right former German Imperial Army general Erich Ludendorff.Walter Laqueur, Russia and Germany: A Century of Conflict, 1990, p. 74 Markov also played a leading role in the conspiracy that resulted in the murder of Constitutional Democratic Party politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov.
He published his memoirs, Voiny temnykh sil of dark forces, in 1928 and soon thereafter became a follower of the Nazi Party. He would go on to argue that the URP had shared many characteristics with the Nazi Party, although this has been rejected given that the URP was little more than anti-Semitic populism.H. Rogger, Jewish Policies and Right Wing Politics in Imperial Russia, 1986 His anti-Semitism grew more pronounced in the 1930s and he undertook lecture tours and propaganda duties for the Nazis on the subject.

Euro starter kits are packs of euro coins of all the eight denominations sealed in a plastic bag. The scope of these kits is primarily to familiarise the citizens of that nation that is going to join the eurozone with the new currency, the euro. Another objective is to fill up cash registers well in advance of €-Day. Usually these kits are available from the local banks some weeks before the euro changeover.[tpl]Cite web|author=WebDNA Studio |url=http://eurocoinscollectionmalta.freehostia.com |title=Euro Coins Collection Malta |publisher=Eurocoinscollectionmalta.freehostia.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl]
Mainly there are two types of starter packs; business starter kits and kits for the general public. The difference is in the number of coins per pack. Business kits are intended for retailers, thereby they contain around 100 euro or more of coins and are normally contained in rolls, whereas, the mini-starter kits are intended for the general public and usually these kits have a small volume of coins.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://jore.neuf.fr/starter%20kit.html |title=La page n'existe plus |publisher=Jore.neuf.fr |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://euromuenzen.com/starterkits/ |title=Euro Starterkits |publisher=Euromuenzen.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://eurocollection.ning.com |title=The €uro Coins Collection Network |publisher=Eurocollection.ning.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2011[/tpl]

"Time to Change" is a song recorded in 1972 by The Brady Bunch Kids, the children characters on 1970s television situation comedy The Brady Bunch. The song and another Brady Bunch Kids song, "We Can Make the World a Whole Lot Brighter", were featured in The Brady Bunch episode "Dough Re Mi", which aired on January 14, 1972.
Written by Raymond Bloodworth, Billy Meshel and Chris Welch, "Time to Change" features solos by Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick, who portrayed the Brady's eldest children Greg and Marcia, respectively, on the TV series. The song can be classified as an example of a novelty "bubblegum pop" record.
"Time to Change" was released as The Brady Bunch's second single, with "We Can Make the World a Whole Lot Brighter" as the B-side. The song performed poorly on the pop charts, failing to reach the Billboard Hot 100.
The original recording of "Time to Change" is currently found on their greatest hits album, It's a Sunshine Day: The Best of The Brady Bunch, and a re-recorded version was released on the soundtrack to A Very Brady Sequel.

[[John White Howell]]
CATEGORIES: IEEE Edison Medal recipients, 1937 deaths, Rutgers University alumni, Stevens Institute of Technology alumni, 1857 births

John White Howell (December 22, 1857 - July 28, 1937) was an American electrical engineer who spent his entire professional career (1880 to 1930) working for Thomas Edison, specializing in the development and manufacturing of the incandescent lamp.  
In 1924 Howell was a recipient of the IEEE Edison Medal for his contributions towards the development of the incandescent lamp. Howell later co-authored the book History of the Incandescent Lamp, the authoritative source for the identification and description of Edison lamps.
Howell attended Rutgers University, College of the City of New York, and the Stevens Institute of Technology. 
John W. Howell, electrical engineer, was born at New Brunswick, New Jersey, December 22, 1857, son of Martin Armstrong and Abigail Lucetta (Stout) Howell. His earliest paternal American ancestor was Edward Howell, who came to America from Marsh Gibbon, England, Prior to 1639, received a land grant of 500 acres at Lynn, Massachusetts, and was a founder of Southampton, Long Island, New York, in 1640.
From Edward and his wife Frances ---, the line of descent was through Richard and Elizabeth (Halsey) Howell; Stephen and Mary (Stout) Howell, and Martin Armstrong and Jane (White) Howell, the grandparents of John White Howell. His grandfather Howell was a ship-owner and railway official and his father was an inventor of note and manufacture.
Mr. Howell was educated at the College of the City of New York (1874–76), Rutgers College (1876–78) and Stevens Institute of Technology (1878–81). In his last year at Stevens he wrote a thesis on “Economy of Electric Lighting by Incandescence,” giving original and accurate data on the efficiency of dynamos and lamps, carrying capacity of conductors, drops in house wiring, and allied subjects. Published in booklet form under the title of “Incandescent Electric Lights,” in 1882, it was at once translated into several languages.
As a result of this paper, Mr. Howell entered the employ of Thomas A. Edison at the then recently established Edison Works at Menlo Park, New Jersey, in the engineering department in July 1881, being first engaged in the preparation of equipment for the photometric measurement and testing of incandescent lamps and developing methods and procedure for their manufacture on a commercial scale. 
In 1890 Mr. Howell provided key technical evidence in one of the most important of Edison's many patent infringement trials;Matthew Josephson "Edison, A Biography" pp 357-358, (1959) the trial of Edison Electric Light Co. vs. The United States Electric Lighting Company, sometimes referred to as "the great carbon filament suit"Matthew Josephson "Edison, A Biography" pp 359, (1959) or "the great filament suit".The Electrical Engineer, July 19, 1893, pp 61 The United States Electric lighting Company was being sued by Edison for infringing on Edison's high resistance carbon filament patent. As part of their defense, lawyers for U.S. Electric Lighting Company contended that Edison's patent was invalid because they claimed the circa 1879 hand-made lamps described in the original 1880 patent could not be reproduced using materials and methods described in the patent. In response, two of Edison's lab technicians tried and failed in their attempts to hand-make the lamps for the court.John W. Howell "Stories for my Children", pp 25, (1930) Mr. Howell was then put to the task. He succeeded in making thirty to forty working "tar putty" carbon filament lamps, replicas of Edison's original breakthrough lamp design, as described in Edison's fundamental patentJohn W. Howell "Stories for my Children", pp 26, (1930)
. In rendering his decision in favor of Edison's patent, the judge on the case said that Mr. Howell's testimony had completely refuted the claims that the patent did not give sufficient information to enable a man skilled in the art to make the lamps.John W. Howell "Stories for my Children", pp 26, (1930) 
Edison showcased his victory in this famous trial at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. There, inside one of the many lamp cases on display at the Edison exhibit of the General Electric Company were displayed two of the "tar putty" carbon filament lamps made by John W. Howell for the 1890 trial, as well as the tools used by Howell to make said lamps.The Electrical Engineer, July 19, 1893, pp 61 
Seven of Mr. Howell's hand-made 1890 patent trial "tar putty" lamps survive today in a collection of rare, historic lamps discovered in 2004.http://www.edisonian.com/
In 1893 Mr. Howell was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works of the General Electric Company, which had taken over the Edison lamp works, holding that position until his retirement in 1931. From 1900 until his death he was a member of the advisory council of the research laboratory of the General Electric Company at Schenectady, New York.
Soon after taking up his work in the Edison laboratories at Menlo Park, Mr. Howell invented the first reliable electric current pressure indicator, known as the Howell voltmeter, which was the standard for central station switchboards until the development of the Weston voltmeter in 1890.
Besides inventing this pioneer electric current measuring device he improved existing devices and originated much new apparatus used in the manufacture of electric lamps, and left a permanent impress on the art of electric lighting in many directions.
Through the years he was intimately associated with inventions which increased lamp manufacturing from an initial rate of 35,000 lamps a year to 3,000 lamps a minute.Obituary of John W. Howell, Newark New Jersey Star Eagle, July 1937
In 1885, as a result of exhaustive tests of lamp life, he determined  the relative lives of lamps at different initial candle powers, obtaining an exponent of efficiency which was the subject of an important paper read before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1888. He also invented an automatic machine for treating the carbon filament which eliminated the grave fire hazards of former process and which for many years was used in electric lamp manufacture, both in this country and in Europe; a four-head vertical sealing-in machine (1896) which was the first modern glass working machines used in the electric lamp industry; and, in collaboration with William Russell Burrows, a stem making machine (1901) which superseded the hand method of making electric lamp stems. In all, some fifty patents were granted him.  
Besides making valuable original contributions to the literature of his profession, Mr. Howell assisted, by his discussion of the papers of others, in developing many important themes relative to method of electrical distribution, photometric standards and allied subjects, and he was co-author, with Henry Schroeder, of the “History of the Incandescent Lamp” (1927).
In recognition of his contributions to the development of the incandescent lamp, he was awarded the Edison Medal by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1924, the citation stating: “In the evolution and development of that lamp he has rendered invaluable service. For forty-three years he has carried on an enormous amount of research work which has given the incandescent lamp its present universal usefulness. As the lighting branch was for many years the foundation, the parent, of the light and power industry, as we known it today, it is certain that Mr. Howell has played a most important and distinguished part in the scientific progress of his day.”
In 1930 Mr. Howell published his memoirs Stories for my Children.
Mr. Howell was given an honorary E.E. degree by Stevens Institute of Technology in 1899 and an honorary Sc.D. degree by Rutgers University in 1925 and Stevens Institute of Technology in 1932.
He was a member of the board of managers of the Howard Savings Institution of Newark, New Jersey; a trustee of the Newark (New Jersey) Museum Association, and the Marcus L. Ward Home, at Maplewood, New Jersey; a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the Illuminating Engineering Society, Franklin Institute, International Electro-Technical Commission, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Edison Pioneers (president, 1923–1924), Theta Xi, the Essex and Essex County Country clubs of Newark, Adirondack League Club of Herkimer County, New York, Maidstone Club at Easthampton, Long Island, New York, and the Mid-Pines Country Club of Knollwood, North Carolina.
Mr. Howell was an Episcopalian in religion and for many years was a vestryman of Grace Church in Newark. Politically he was an independent. 
Modest, generous, gentle, Mr. Howell was everywhere recognized as a master of his art, who never lost his leadership through over a half a century of fruitful activity and who retained always the friendship of Thomas Edison.
He was married twice: (1) in Newark, New Jersey,  January 25, 1889, to Mary Cortlandt, daughter of Edward Cortlandt Drake, a merchant, of that place; she died in 1890; (2) in Newark, New Jersey, April 23, 1895 to Frederica Burckle, daughter of Robert Gilchrist, lawyer and attorney general of New Jersey. By the second marriage he had five children; Frederica Burckle, wife of Albert Blake Williams; John White; Jane Augusta Appleton, wife of Elijah Parish Lovejoy; Cornelia Margaret, wife of Nathan Comfort Starr, and Robert Gilchrist Howell.
Mr. John W. Howell’s death occurred in New York city, July 28, 1937.

Bingham created the KCET Science and Society Unit.  There he wrote and produced the Frontiers of the Mind series, which included "The Addicted Brain", "The Sexual Brain", "The Time of Our Lives", and "Inside Information".Holdings: Frontiers of the Mind http://newcatalogue.library.unisa.edu.au/vufind/Record/54292 (21 May 2009)  He has co-authored two books, Wild Card (1974) and The Origin of Minds: Evolution, Uniqueness, and the New Science of the Self (Harmony, 2002).
In 1996, Bingham hosted and co-wrote the PBS television series The Human Quest (1996). Philip Hefner wrote that the series "represents some of the best and most sensitive popular discussion of cutting-edge science available".Stories Science Tells: Defining the Human Quest by Philip Hefner, The Christian Century http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=126 (27 May 2009)  The Human Quest episode The Nature Of Human Nature won a Writers Guild of America Award. The Human Quest was built on the conceptual framework of evolutionary psychology which Bingham began to distance himself from in the mid-1990s.Edge Question 2008: What Have You Changed Your Mind About? Why?
From 1995-96, Bingham was a visiting associate at Caltech in Biology and interacted with neuroscientists, including evolutionary neuroscientist, John Allman. Bingham and Peggy La Cerra presented an alternative to the model of evolutionary psychology in their book, The Origin of Minds, (Harmony, 2002). This model was based on the concept of adaptive representational networks (ARN). According to this theory, these networks encode the history of an individual's behavioral successes and failures in relationship to the energy costs of any particular behavior. Hence, memory becomes an accounting mechanism for computing the energy costs of behavior.Human Nature Review, 2000, Vol 3, 440-447 http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/03/lacerra.html La Cerra and Bingham called this model "Theoretical Evolutionary Neuroscience.".The adaptive nature of the human neurocognitive architecture: An alternative model, PNAS http://www.pnas.org/content/95/19/11290.abstract After the publication of "The Origin of Minds," Bingham turned his attention to developing a platform for science communication; he has not published any further work in the field of neuroscience.
In 2003, Roger Bingham and Terry Sejnowski initiated a science education project that became known as The Science Network.Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science? http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 (21 May 2009) The Science Network (TSN) is a web-based organization concerned with science and its impact on society.

[[Mediatrix of all graces]]
CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic Mariology, Marian dogmas, Titles of Mary

Mediatrix of All Graces is a special Marian title that some Roman Catholics give to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the mother of Jesus Christ, encompassing the belief that all the graces and blessings that her son gives come through her.
This attributes to her a role more extensive than the role of mediation or intercession attributed to her in Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy and for which the title "Mediatrix" is used.Jill Dubisch, In a Different Place (Princeton University Press 1995 ISBN 9780691029672), p. 236
The Second Vatican Council referred in its document Lumen gentium to Mary as "Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix and Mediatrix". It did not use the phrase "Mediatrix of all graces". 
The establishment of Mediatrix of all graces as a dogma is still being debated among Catholic theologians, given that it goes further than the use of the title Mediatrix and the doctrine of Mary having a higher level of saintly intercession (due to her special relationship with her son Jesus), but has not received Vatican approval.Mark Miravalle, 1993, Introduction to Mary, Queenship Publishing ISBN 978-1-882972-06-7, pages 110-111, 207-208L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English 25 June 1997, page 10

The clothes started selling on March 10, 2004, and from the beginning in only one store called Weekday.

CATEGORIES: Plays by Bertolt Brecht, Compositions by Paul Dessau, 1943 plays, Plays set in China

The Good Person of Szechwan (German: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan, first translated less literally as The Good Woman of Setzuan)The title of the play is translated as The Good Person of Szechwan by John Willett in vol. 6 of Brecht's Plays, Poetry and Prose series edited by John Willett and Ralph Manheim.  The play first appeared in English as The Good Woman of Setzuan (1948; revised 1961) by Eric Bentley and has been translated as The Good Person of Sichuan (1990) by Michael Hofmann, and more recently as The Good Soul of Szechuan (2008) by David Harrower. See Willett and Manheim (1994), Bentley (2007), Hofmann (1990), and Harrower (2008). is a play written by the German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht, in collaboration with Margarete Steffin and Ruth Berlau.Willett (1967, 50-1). The play was begun in 1938 but not completed until 1943, while the author was in exile in the United States. It was first performed in 1943 at the Zürich Schauspielhaus in Switzerland, with a musical score and songs by Swiss composer Huldreich Georg Früh.Willett (1967, 51). Today, Paul Dessau's composition of the songs from 1947–48, also authorized by Brecht, is the better-known version. The play is an example of Brecht's "non-Aristotelian drama", a dramatic form intended to be staged with the methods of epic theatre. The play is a parable set in the Chinese "city of Sichuan".Brecht seems to have become aware that Sichuan was actually a province over the course of several drafts (appended in Willet 1994) and the version eventually published by Suhrkamp has "The capital of Sezuan" (though there are no details that suggest the action might take place in Chengdu).  Bentley introduced the spelling Setzuan as a transcription of the German Sezuan (and defends it in the forward to the 1999 printing); other translators have used the names Szechuan or Szechwan.

The Common Schools Act of 1871 was legislation of the Canadian Province of New Brunswick, passed by the 22nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, which replaced the Parish Schools Act of 1858.  The legislation aimed to abolish church-run schooling in New Brunswick and replace it with a system of government-run "common schools".  This suited many Protestants very well, since they were divided into numerous denominations that could not agree. But the act was stridently opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and its adherents, and a series of clashes between New Brunswick Catholics and the provincial government culminated in the shooting of two people following riots at Caraquet in 1875, after which the act was substantially amended to implement a joint religious/secular schooling system.

" was an American radio and television announcer, perhaps best known as the "Voice of NBC News."
Hanrahan's broadcasting career dated back to the 1940s, when he worked at WELI radio in New Haven, Connecticut,"Out of the Mouth of Radio Legend Bud Finch," by J.R. Morton.  Hamden Daily News, December 19, 2005.  Retrieved on May 22, 2008.

Hanrahan's early television credits include The Nat King Cole Show, for which he was one of the announcers during its short-lived 1956–57 run.  He also did a few other entertainment-based shows over the years, including two December episodes of Saturday Night Live in 1981 (the December 5 episode with host Tim Curry and musical guest Meat Loaf and the December 12 episode with host Bill Murray and musical guests The Spinners and The Yale Whiffenpoofs) on which he substituted for Mel Brandt (who was hired to be an announcer for that season following the brief departure of Don Pardo).Saturday Night Live "Not-So-FAQ - The Cast and Crew" ("Q: How many announcers have there been?")Saturday Night Live FAQ: General Questions ("Subject: Didn't somebody else announce in the early 80's?")
But Hanrahan's biggest claim to fame was as announcer for numerous NBC News programs, including the Huntley-Brinkley Report and its successor, NBC Nightly News, up until his retirement in 1983.  He handled announcing duties for the network's coverage of political conventions, space launches, assassinations, and other major stories during his tenure.  His voice became as familiar to a generation of viewers as those of fellow staff announcers Don Pardo, Bill Wendell, Wayne Howell, and Hanrahan's eventual successor as Nightly News announcer, Howard Reig.
Hanrahan died on August 7, 1996 in Fairfield, Connecticut, at the age of 77.

Richard Paul "Red" Smith (May 18, 1904 – March 8, 1978) was an American player and coach in both professional baseball and professional football. A native of Brokaw, Wisconsin, Smith stood 5'9" (175 cm) tall, and weighed 215 pounds (97 kg). A catcher in baseball, he batted and threw right-handed. He played under three of the early 20th century's most famous American sporting coaches—football's Knute Rockne and Curly Lambeau, and baseball's John McGraw.
Smith attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played football for Rockne and captained the Fighting Irish varsity baseball team. In [tpl]by|1927[/tpl], he turned professional in both sports. He appeared in one game for the New York Giants of baseball's National League, where he recorded one putout and made no errors in the field, but did not record an official at bat. He was then farmed to the Jersey City Skeeters of the AA International League. That turned out to be Smith's only game as a Major League Baseball player, although he played in the minor leagues throughout much of the next decade. In the autumn of 1927, he also turned professional in football with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League, where he played five games. In the NFL, he also played for the New York football Giants and the New York football Yankees.
Smith continued as a coach in both sports after his playing career ended. He was football coach at Georgetown University (1930) and the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1933–35), athletic director at Seton Hall University (1931–32) and an assistant coach for the Packers and Giants from 1936 to 1944.
In baseball, he managed in three Class D minor leagues—the Bi-State League, KITTY League and Wisconsin State League—from 1936 to 1938 and in 1941–42. He also served as a coach for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association (1939–40; 1943–44). In [tpl]by|1945[/tpl] he returned to the majors as a coach for the pennant-winning Chicago Cubs, working under Charlie Grimm, who had been his skipper in Milwaukee. Smith served on the Cub coaching staff through [tpl]by|1949[/tpl]. He then returned to the minor-league Brewers as the team's business manager, briefly filling in as manager in 1952, and moved with the franchise to Toledo, Ohio, when it became the Toledo Sox in 1953. He left baseball in 1955, when the Toledo franchise moved to Wichita, Kansas. He then worked in the brewery industry.
Every January there is a fund raising banquet held in Appleton, Wisconsin, that is named in his honor.
Red Smith died in Toledo in 1978 at age 73.

The Chicago Blizzard of 1979 was a major blizzard that affected northern Illinois and north-west Indiana, United States on Saturday, January 13 – Sunday, January 14, 1979. [tpl]convert|16.5|in|cm|1[/tpl] of snow fell on January 13 alone, setting a new record for snow in one calendar day in Chicago. By the end of January 14, [tpl]convert|18.8|in|cm|1[/tpl] of snow had fallen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lot/?n=Jan_wx_trivia |title=January Weather Trivia |date=2005-11-29 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |author=National Weather Service (Romeoville, IL)[/tpl] The cold weather and snowfall throughout the rest of January and February resulted in frozen tracks throughout the Chicago 'L' and Metra systems. Commuters crowded onto CTA buses, quickly overwhelming capacity, resulting in bus commutes usually taking 30 to 45 minutes taking up to several hours. 
To avoid huge snowdrifts in the streets, the overcrowded buses were obliged to take numerous detours, adding additional time to the commute. Deployment of plows was significantly delayed and when they finally appeared they struggled to keep up with the snowfall. Much of the snow remained unremoved throughout the next 2 months, causing ongoing public transit delays and significant problems with trash collection.  The city's inadequate response to the blizzard was blamed primarily on mayor Michael Bilandic, who had assumed the post after the 1976 death of Richard J. Daley.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zAM1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=A08KAAAAIBAJ&dq=bilandic%20blizzard&pg=6311%2C1192586|work=Bangor Daily News|date=April 4, 1979|accessdate=June 17, 2012|location=Bangor, ME|page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zAM1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=A08KAAAAIBAJ&dq=bilandic%20blizzard&pg=1990%2C1236911|work=Bangor Daily News|date=April 4, 1979|accessdate=June 17, 2012|location=Bangor, ME|page=10[/tpl] Newspaper articles at the time blasted Bilandic; Jane Byrne, Bilandic's main political rival in the Democratic primary (who had previously worked with Bilandic in the Daley administration and been fired by Bilandic when the two could not get along), capitalized on this and went on to defeat Bilandic in the February 27 primary.

The Smiley face murder theory (variations include Smiley face murders, Smiley face killings, Smiley face gang, and others) is a theory advanced by two retired New York City detectives, Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte, that a number of young men found dead in bodies of water across several states over the last decade did not accidentally drown, as concluded by law enforcement agencies, but were victims of a serial killer or killers. The term smiley face became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that the police had discovered graffiti depicting a smiley face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases.

[[Optima (grape)]]

Optima is a white wine grape that was created by viticulturalist Peter Morio at the Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding in the Palatinate in 1930.Wein-Plus Glossar: Optima, accessed on January 22, 2013Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Optima, accessed on May 22, 2008 Morio crossed a Riesling x Silvaner cross with Müller-Thurgau. The Riesling x Silvaner is sometimes mentioned as Rieslaner, but more often just as "a Riesling x Silvaner".[tpl]cite encyclopedia |editor=Jancis Robinson | encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Wine |edition= Third Edition |title=Optima |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=495 [/tpl] Due to the random element of genetic recombination involved in sexual reproduction of plants, no two crosses of the same parent grape varieties will be identical, so there is a difference between the Riesling x Silvaner cross Rieslaner, and each other such cross.
Optima received varietal protection and was released for general cultivation in 1970 and 1971, respectively. Its name is derived from the Latin language word for "the best".
Optima ripens very early, even before other varieties which are considered as early ripening, such as Müller-Thurgau. Its late budding made it popular in the Mosel region, since it thus was less prone to frost damage. It can also grow on poor sites, where more demanding grape varieties such as Riesling do not ripen very reliably. It also easily achieves very impressive must weights, resulting in its use as a booster of Prädikat levels and sweetness in cheap German blended wines, primarily in Rheinhessen and Mosel. This use is similar to the variety Ortega.
Varietal wines made from Optima grapes are usually yellow-green in colour, can show aromas similar to Riesling, but are lower in acidity. For this reason they have been described as "flabby and undistinguished", and as mentioned above, primarily used in blends.
German plantings of Optima peaked at [tpl]convert|420|ha[/tpl] in 1990, but in similarity with many other new breeds of white German grapes, Optima has lost popularity in recent years. It is now grown on less than [tpl]convert|100|ha[/tpl] of vineyards in Germany. The remaining plantations are found primarily in Mosel and Rheinhessen.
It is known under the synonyms (breeding codes) Geilweilerhof 33-13-113 and Gf. 33-13-113.
Optima was used in a crossing to produce the grape variety Orion.

[[Clean feed (TV)]]
CATEGORIES: Film and video technology, Television terminology

In television technology, a clean feed is a video signal that does not have added graphics and text. This video signal is used in sport production to allow different television stations to add their own digital on-screen graphic image on a common signal, or in news broadcasting to produce two or more different streams, each one with the same picture but in different languages.
A clean feed is a signal which has not come from the main output of the video switcher, such as the output of a vision mixer before the downstream keyer stage - the clean feed is identical to the main program output but without any captions keyed into it. Modern production equipment can actually put different keys on multiple outputs, allowing them to go to the clean feed or not. The most sophisticated vision mixers (or production switchers, according to the American nomenclature) can generate a clean feed output for any of their mix/effects (ME) buses.
The term "clean feed" is also used to refer to backhaul feeds of television programming sent via communication satellite or other transport (such as a national fiber-optic network) sent from another TV station or remote television production truck on-location,  which does not carry any television advertisements or break bumpers, or in some cases, lower-third graphics or superimposed chyron text.

[[Health insurance coverage in the United States]]

[[File:Health uninsurance rates in the United States by state, 2009.svg|thumb|300px|Percentage of people without health insurance coverage by state, according to the United States Census Bureau (2009).
[tpl]legend|rgb(255, 255, 210)|4–10%[/tpl]]]
The number of persons without health insurance coverage in the United States is one of the primary concerns raised by advocates of health care reform. A person without health insurance is commonly termed uninsured (regardless of insurance of objects unrelated to health), and this article uses the term in this sense as well. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2009 there were 48.6 million people in the US (15.7% of the population) who were without health insurance."Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009." U.S. Census Bureau. p. 22. Issued September 2010. The percentage of the non-elderly population who are uninsured has been generally increasing since the year 2000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://covertheuninsured.org/factsheets/display.php?FactSheetID=101 |title=Percentage of Nonelderly Americans Without Health Insurance Coverage, 1987-2006 |accessdate=2008-01-21 |format= |work=CovertheUninsured.org, a project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019085933/http://covertheuninsured.org/factsheets/display.php?FactSheetID=101  |archivedate = 2007-10-19[/tpl]
The causes of this rate of uninsurance remain a matter of political debate. Rising insurance costs have contributed to a trend in which fewer employers are offering health insurance, and many employers are managing costs by requiring higher employee contributions. Many of the uninsured are the working poor or are unemployed. Others are healthy and choose to go without it. Some have been rejected by insurance companies and are considered "uninsurable". Some are without health insurance only temporarily. Some choose faith-based alternatives to health insurance.

CATEGORIES: 1561 deaths, Spanish Dominicans, Spanish missionaries, 16th-century Spanish people, Year of birth unknown

Pedro Angulo (died 1561) was a Spanish Dominican missionary in Guatemala, in the sixteenth century.
He was a native of Burgos in Spain, and came to America in 1524 as a soldier, but joined the Dominican order in 1529. He became a companion of Bartolomé de las Casas in Guatemala, Central America in general, and the Greater Antilles (Santo Domingo). He was made Provincial of the Dominicans for Chiapas and Bishop of Vera Paz, but died soon afterwards. 
Angulo was one of the principal figures of the earliest Indian Missions in Southern Mexico and Guatemala, and more successful than Las Casas. He visited tribe after tribe, and lived and taught among them. He resorted to charts on which biblical subjects were allegorically represented. These he carried with him through the wilderness to use as illustrations for his discourses to the natives. 
He was proficient in Nahuatl and Zutuhil, and wrote several tracts on religious subjects in the latter.

King Swamp is the self-titled debut album of the British rock band King Swamp.  Originally released in May 1989, the album was well received by critics.  But, its failure to peak even in the top-150 on the Billboard 200 proved to be a bad omen.  When their second album failed to chart anywhere in the U.S. or the U.K., the band split up.  Despite the failure of the album to find a commercial audience, it did have the unique distinction of being featured on the 1980s TV show Miami Vice.  The track 'Year Zero' was used during the pre-credit car chase sequence of the two-hour finale episode titled 'Freefall' (first aired on May 21, 1989).

Pg. 20. was an American business magnate, best remembered for the endowments of his substantial collections of books and original manuscripts from Native American and colonial-era history and ethnology, which were donated to the Newberry Library and Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Ayer had over time built an immense fortune out of supplying timber to the 19th century’s fast-growing railroad industry. However, it was a chance encounter in his youth with a book that inspired Ayer's lifelong investments of time and money that resulted one of the largest collections of historical and American literature accumulated by the early 20th century. That book was William H. Prescott’s famous History of the Conquest of Mexico, which Ayer first read in a small library attached to a silver mine south of Tucson Ayer had been guarding as part of his military service. By his own account, he was indelibly marked by what he read and it became the foundation for his insatiable interest in Indian Americana literature.Ayer (1950)

A purebred dog typically refers to a dog of a modern dog breed with a documented pedigree in a stud book and may be registered with a breed club that may also be part of a national kennel club.[tpl]Citation |others= The Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff |title= Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher= G&C Merriam Company |location= Springfield, MA U.S.A. |pages= 274 |quote= A breed is a group of domestic animals related through common ancestors and visiblily similar in most characteristics, having been differentiated from others by human influence; a distinctive group of domesticated animals differentiated from the wild type under the influence of man, the sum of the progeny of a known and designated foundation stock without admixture of other blood. |year= 1967[/tpl]
Purebred dog may also be used in a different manner to refer to dogs of specific dog types and landraces that are not modern breeds. An example is cited by biologist Raymond Coppinger, of an Italian shepherd who keeps only the white puppies from his sheep guardian dog's litters, and culls the rest, because he defines the white ones as purebred. Coppinger says, "The shepherd's definition of pure is not wrong, it is simply different from mine."[tpl]Citation | last =Coppinger | first =Raymond | author-link = | last2 =Coppinger | first2 =Lorna | publication-date =2001 | title =Dogs, A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior & Evolution | publication-place =New York | publisher =Scribner | pages =138 | isbn =0-684-85530-5 | year =2001 [/tpl] However, the usual definition is the one that involves modern breeds.

It states that a particular class of games has a mixed value, provided that at least one of the players has a strategy that is restricted to absolutely continuous distributions with respect to the Lebesgue measure (in other words, one of the players is forbidden to use a pure strategy).
The theorem is attributed to the Indian mathematician Thiruvenkatachari Parthasarathy.

Coventry-Eagle was a British bicycle and motorcycle manufacturer. Established as a Victorian bicycle maker, the company began under the name of Hotchkiss, Mayo & Meek.  The company name was changed to Coventry Eagle in 1897 when John Meek left the company .http://www.classicmotorhistory.com/index.php?p=1_6_Motorcycle-Publications, Classic Motor History.  By 1898 they had begun to experiment with motorised vehicles and by 1899, had produced their first motorcycle.  The motorcycles were hand built from components and finished carefully, Coventry-Eagle motorcycles proved reliable and by the First World War the range included Villiers Engineering and JAP engines.[ref]
</ref>
During the early 1920s, the models changed depending on what engines were available and the company swapped between five engine manufacturers - Villiers, JAP, Sturmey-Archer, Blackburne and Matchless.[tpl]cite book|last=Tragatsch|first=Erwin|title=The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles|year=2000|publisher=Quantum Publishing|location=London|isbn=1861603428|pages=560[/tpl]  The model Flying 8 was probably the most iconic bike of its time and bore a resemblance to the contemporary Brough Superior.  During the depression of the 1930s, the company concentrated on producing two-strokes. Production continued until the start of the Second World War in 1939.[ref]
</ref>
In the 1930s they had launched a range of sporting bikes under the "Falcon" brand. After the war, and not of a scale to continue competitive motorcycle manufacture, the company concentrated on their racing bicycles. It was under this marque that the company relaunched itself as Falcon Cycles, now a division of Tandem Group.

The statue depicts a Confederate soldier standing ready.  It is made of white marble, and stands atop a granite pedestal and limestone base.  On the pedestal is part of the Bivouac of the Dead, written by Theodore O'Hara, who is also buried in Frankfort Cemetery.Civil War in Kentucky
Frankfort would be the only Union state capital captured in the war.  Confederate general Kirby Smith would capture the town on September 3, 1862, and would continue a Confederate force until the Battle of Perryville, which forced the Confederacy away from any future control of Kentucky during the American Civil War.  This would cause the Union citizenry to build two forts to protect Frankfort.  These forts prevented John Hunt Morgan from recapturing the city for the Confederacy in 1864.Confederate Invasion of Kentucky, late 1862

Foguang Temple (Chinese: 佛光寺) is a Buddhist temple located five kilometres from Doucun, Wutai County, Shanxi Province of China. The major hall of the temple is the Great East Hall, built in 857 AD, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). According to architectural records, it is the third earliest preserved timber structure in China. It was rediscovered by the 20th-century architectural historian Liang Sicheng (1901–1972) in 1937, while an older hall at Nanchan Temple was discovered by the same team a year later.'Discovered' in this context means that while the temple was known to local people, its importance was unknown to the academic community. The temple also contains another significant hall dating from 1137 called the Manjusri Hall. In addition, the second oldest existing pagoda in China (after the Songyue Pagoda), dating from the 6th century, is located in the temple grounds.Qin (2004), 342.

[[Calosoma]]

CATEGORIES: Calosoma, Carabinae, Biological pest control

[tpl]italic title[/tpl]

Calosoma is a genus of large ground beetles that occur primarily throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and are referred to as caterpillar hunters or searchers. Many of the 167 species are largely or entirely black, but some have bright metallic coloration. They produce a foul-smelling spray from glands near the tip of the abdomen. They are recognizable due to their large thorax, which is almost the size of their abdomen and much wider than their head.Powell & Hogue (1979), California Insects. p. 262.
In 1905, Calosoma sycophanta was imported to New England for control of the Gypsy Moth. The species is a voracious consumer of caterpillars during both its larval stage and as an adult, as are other species in the genus. For this reason, they are generally considered beneficial insects. Several species of this beetle, most notably calosoma semilaeve (also known as black calosoma) are especially common in the California area.

George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron, later George Gordon Noel, 6th Baron Byron, FRS (22 January 1788 – 19 April 1824), commonly known simply as Lord Byron, was an English poet and a leading figure in the Romantic movement. Among Byron's best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the short lyric She Walks in Beauty. He is regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential.
He travelled all over Europe especially in Italy where he lived for seven years and then joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire, for which Greeks revere him as a national hero.
He died one year later at age 36 from a fever contracted while in Missolonghi in Greece.
Often described as the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantics, Byron was celebrated in life for aristocratic excesses, including huge debts, numerous love affairs with both sexes, rumours of a scandalous incestuous liaison with his half-sister, and self-imposed exile.

This 350 MW thyristor-valve back-to-back HVDC station (with a winter overload rating of 435 MW) was completed in 1985 and connects the 315 kV Quebec transmission system with the 345 kV system in New Brunswick.
Madawaska was built by General Electric and is based on their earlier design of the world's first fully thyristor valve link, the 320 MW Eel River back-to-back HVDC station near Dalhousie, NB. However, instead of using synchronous condensers for voltage control and reactive power supply to the thyristors, Madawaska uses switched filter and shunt reactor banks connected to the high voltage busses on each side.
The above information is based on my personal experience (as System Operations Engineer) with New Brunswick Power, serving as their on-site representative at Madawaska during its commissioning over the summer and fall of 1985.  I had previously submitted information on Madawaska HVDC on a page that was deleted from the 'world list of HVDC stations'.

Once the largest town (1895-1900) on the western coast of Canada,[tpl]fact|date=March 2011[/tpl] Shoal Bay was a hub for mining and forestry. Gold was mined in the hillsides above the town and the surrounding areas. When mining slowed in the early 20th century there was an economic shift towards timber and fishing. Shoal bay survived as a small town supporting a school and market until the 1950s when the school closed and families moved to more developed communities such as Campbell River. 
Today, Shoal Bay exists only as a small resort, offering moorage at the government wharf, a small pub/cafe, and accommodation.

It was built in 1901-1902 during the administration of the Kingdom of Hungary (part of Austria-Hungary), according the plans of Marcell Komor and Dezső Jakab replacing a smaller and less elaborate synagogue. It is one of the finest surviving pieces of religious architecture in the art nouveau style.http://www.duke.edu/religion/graphic/subotica.html It served the local Neolog community.
In 1974 the synagogue was designated a Monument of Culture; in  1990 it was designated a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.
The synagogue has long been plagued by conservation issues, though a decade-long partnership between the government and World Monuments Fund that ended in 2010 rendered the building watertight after years of water infiltration.

They are often erroneously described as posthumous.  In general, these études display little of the technical brilliance of most of the composer's Op. 10 and 25, though they do retain Chopin's original formula for harmonic and structural balance.

[[Gruta de Moinhos Velhos]]

CATEGORIES: Caves of Portugal

The Gruta de Moinhos Velhos, is one of the most important cave systems known in the Portuguese Maciço Calcário Estremenho, with about 9 km in extension. It is characterized by the existence of two fóssil paragenetic main conduits of about one decametre in diameter with dendritic tributaries, and a set of semi-active passages in a dendritic pattern at the north and angulate at the south. The fossil zone has a drop of 100 metres and the thickness of intermediate zone varies from 80 metres upstream to 60 metres downstream. Water flows in syngenetic galeries, from the northern to the southern quadrant, towards Gruta da Pena spring.
It's possible to distinguish four genetic phases in the cave system development. The first one is represented by superficial phreatic galleries of small diameter, the second one by the Galeria Gémea paragenetic main conduit, the third one by the Galeria Grande and his tributaries and the last one by the active and semi-active galeries of the lower cave levels.
This cave is inhabited by several endemic trogobionts: the ground-beetle Trechus lunai, the cave spider Nesticus lusitanicus and by several stygobionts, being the isopod Proaellus lusitanicus the most abundant.

The 1989 Sugar Bowl was the 57th edition of the annual game. It featured the fourth ranked Florida State Seminoles and the seventh ranked Auburn Tigers. The game was a defensive slugfest, with the final score Florida State 13, Auburn 7.
Florida State played well on its first offensive possession. Running back Dayne Williams capped an 84-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, making the early score Florida State 7, Auburn 0. That would mark the only touchdown Florida State would score in the game. Auburn quarterback Reggie Slack first pass of the game was intercepted by strong safety Stan Shiver at the Auburn 44-yard line. Florida State would cap the ensuing four play drive with a 25 yard Bill Mason field goal making it 10-0 Florida State.
At the end of the first quarter, Florida State defensive back Dedrick Dodge intercepted a Reggie Slack pass at the Auburn 38-yard line. Florida State's ensuing drive was capped by Mason's second field goal of the game, a 31 yarder, more than 3 minutes into the second quarter. That would be Florida State's last score of the game. With 4 minutes and 9 seconds left in the 1st half, Reggie Slack threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Walter Reeves, on a playaction pass, making it Florida State 13, Auburn 7. There would be no more first half scoring.
The game was filled with several mistakes from Florida State. Running back Sammie Smith score on a 69-yard touchdown run was wiped out by a holding penalty. Despite the penalty, he would still finish the game with a game high 115 yards rushing. Florida State had first and goal at the Auburn 4-yard line, but came up empty after a fake field goal missed. These errors nearly cost Florida State the game.
With 3:30 left in the game, Auburn drove from its own 4-yard line to Florida State's 22-yard line. With 5 seconds left, after a defensive pass interference penalty, Reggie Slack's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Deion Sanders, sealing Florida State's win.

The 1988 Sugar Bowl was the 54th edition to the annual game. It featured the fourth ranked Syracuse Orangemen, and the sixth ranked Auburn Tigers. The Syracuse Orange entered the game unbeaten for the first time since winning the national championship in 1959. The game was a defensive battle, and ended in a 16–16 tie, helping Syracuse cap an unbeaten season. Don McPherson was given game's Most Outstanding Offensive Player award, going 11-of-21 for 140 yards and one touchdown. He was sacked five times by the Auburn defense.
Auburn cracked the scoreboard first, following a 17-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff Burger to wide receiver Lawyer Tillman, catapulting Auburn to a 7–0 lead. Tillman would finish the game with 6 receptions for 125 yards. In the second quarter, Syracuse tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass form All-American quarterback Don McPherson to wideout Deval Glover.

Syracuse fans were outraged by Auburn's decision to tie the game, while Auburn fans found the choice uncontroversial. In protest of the decision by Auburn to tie the game, a Syracuse radio station mailed Auburn coach Pat Dye 2,000 ugly ties, which Dye autographed and auctioned off, raising $30,000 for the Auburn general scholarship fund.Olin Buchanan, "Auburn's Dye has no regrets about tie", June 13, 2006.

CATEGORIES: Spanish admirals, People of the Spanish–American War

Manuel de la Cámara y Libermoore (or Livermoore) was a rear admiral of the Spanish Navy during the Spanish-American War.
Immediately after the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in April 1898, the Spanish Navy ordered major units of its fleet to concentrate at Cadiz to form the 2nd Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Manuel de la Cámara.The Spanish-American War Centennial Website: Pelayo One mission of the squadron, in the absence of any other direction, was to guard the Spanish coast against raids by the United States Navy.
On 1 May 1898, the Spanish Navy's squadron in the Philippines under Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasaron was destroyed by the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay.  The Spanish Ministry of Marine began to consider options for redressing the situation there.  Two of Spain's most powerful warships, the battleship Pelayo and the brand-new armored cruiser Emperador Carlos V were not available when the war began, the former undergoing reconstruction in a French shipyard and the latter not yet delivered from her builders.  But both were rushed into service and assigned to Cámara's squadron.Nofi, p. 58
On 15 June 1898, de la Cámara finally received his orders: He was to sail immediately for the Philippines, escorting a convoy carrying 4,000 Spanish Army troops for reinforcement of the Philippines, and destroy Dewey's squadron there.Nofi. p.168 His orders directed him to depart Cadiz with Pelayo, Emperador Carlos V, auxiliary cruisers Patriota and Rapido, destroyers Audaz, Osado, and Proserpina, and transports Buenos Aires, Panay, Alfonso XII, and Antonio Lopez, and four colliers.  He was to detach Alfonso XII and Antonio Lopez near Gibraltar after dark so that they could proceed to the Caribbean, then take the rest of his force to the Philippines via Gibraltar, Port Said, Suez, Socotra (at which point the colliers were to be detached to return to Cartagena), the Laccadive Islands, and Ceylon. After that, he was told to coal either along the coast of Sumatra or in Singapore or Batavia, and then either make an optional stop at Labuan, Borneo, or proceed directly to Mindanao.  Once in the Philippines, he was to disperse (to places such as Balabac, Jolo, Basilan, and Zamboanga) or concentrate his squadron as best he saw fit to ensure safe arrival of the troops and then deal with Dewey's squadron.Cervera's papers, p. 151-154
de la Cámara sortied from Cadiz on 16 June 1898,Nofi, p. 273 passed Gibraltar on 17 June 1898Nofi, p. 168 (first detaching Alfonso XII and Antonio Lopez for their independent voyages to the Caribbean as ordered), and arrived at Port Said on 26 June 1898.Cervera's papers, p. 154 There he requested permission to transship coal, which the Egyptian government finally denied on 30 June 1898 out of concern for Egyptian neutrality. Working behind the scenes, the  U.S. acting vice counsul to Egypt, diplomat Ethelbert Watts, dissuaded Egyptian and British authorities from permitting de la Cámara to access coal owned by Spain, while at the same time acquiring a lien over coal available in Suez from other sources.French Ensor Chadwick, "The relations of the United States and Spain: the Spanish-American War," Volume 2, p. 388 (1911).
By the time de la Cámara's squadron arrived at Suez on 5 July 1898,Nofi, p. 282 the squadron of Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete had been annihilated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, freeing up the U.S. Navy's heavy forces from the blockade of Santiago de Cuba.  Fearful for the security of the Spanish coast, the Spanish Ministry of Marine recalled Cámara's squadron on 7 July 1898.Nofi, p. 283 de la Cámara departed Suez on 11 July 1898 for Spain, where the 2nd Squadron was dissolved on 25 July 1898.

[[List of indigenous names of Eastern Caribbean islands]]
CATEGORIES: Caribbean islands, Indigenous topics of the Caribbean, Caribbean culture

This list of the indigenous names of the Eastern Caribbean islands is a compilation of the indigenous names that were given by Amerindian peoples to those islands before the Europeans started naming them. The islands of the Caribbean were settled for over 4,000 years (estimate) before European arrival in 1492. The Eastern Caribbean islands were dominated by two main cultural groups: the Arawaks and the Kalinago, or Caribs. Individual villages of other distinct cultural groups were also present on the more southerly, larger islands. The large island of Trinidad in particular was shared by both Kalinago and Arawak groups.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the Arawaks arrived first, settling the islands as they travelled North from the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Kalinago people, who proved to be more dominant in warfare, had begun a campaign of conquering and displacement of the Arawaks at the point of European arrival. Also starting at the southern end of the archipelago, they had worked their way north, reaching as far as the island of Saint Kitts by the 16th century. 
The islands north of the Saint Kitts 'borderline' had Arawak names, the islands South had Kalinago names. The island of Barbados was uninhabited at the point of European arrival, but evidence suggests that Barbados followed the same pattern of displacement as witnessed on neighbouring islands, but that is was abandoned for unknown reasons. The only indigenous name on record for Barbados is one documented as the name used by Arawak peoples on Trinidad in reference to that island.

Blyth Power Station (also known as Cambois Power Station) refers to a pair of now demolished coal-fired power stations, which were located on the Northumberland coast in North East England. The two stations were built alongside each other on a site near Cambois in Northumberland, on the northern bank of the River Blyth, between its tidal estuary and the North Sea. The stations took their name from the town of Blyth on the opposite bank of the estuary. Blyth A Power Station was built and opened first but had a smaller generating capacity than its sister station, Blyth B Power Station, which was built to its west four years later. The power stations' four large chimneys were a landmark of the Northumberland skyline for over 40 years; the A Station's two chimneys each stood at [tpl]convert|140|m[/tpl]; the B Station's two chimneys were taller, at [tpl]convert|170|m[/tpl] each.
Construction of the B Station began shortly after the A station was completed. The stations were built during a period in which there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480 megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250 MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730 MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000 homes.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref]
The A Station first generated electricity in 1958, a year after the creation of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and the stations operated until 2001. They were operated by the successors of the CEGB, including National Power, following the privatisation of the UK's power industry. After their closure in 2001, the stations  were demolished over the course of two years, ending with the demolition of the stations' chimneys on 7 December 2003. As of 2009, the site is still covered in debris from the demolition. RWE Npower have proposed the construction of a clean coal-fired power station on the site. However, as of November 2009, these plans have been postponed.[ref]

[[Soil structure interaction]]

CATEGORIES: Structural engineering, Earthquake and seismic risk mitigation, Earthquake engineering

Most of the civil engineering structures involve some type of structural element with direct contact with ground.  When the external forces, such as earthquakes, act on these systems, neither the structural displacements nor the ground displacements, are independent of each other.  The process in which the response of the soil influences the motion of the structure and the motion of the structure influences the response of the soil is termed as soil-structure interaction (SSI).Tuladhar, R., Maki, T., Mutsuyoshi, H. (2008). Cyclic behavior of laterally loaded concrete piles embedded into cohesive soil, Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, Vol. 37 (1), pp. 43-59 
Conventional structural design methods neglect the SSI effects.  Neglecting SSI is reasonable for light structures in relatively stiff soil such as low rise buildings and simple rigid retaining walls.  The effect of SSI, however, becomes prominent for heavy structures resting on relatively soft soils for example nuclear power plants, high-rise buildings and elevated-highways on soft soil.Wolf, J. P. (1985). Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey
Damage sustained in recent earthquakes, such as the 1995 Kobe Earthquake, have also highlighted that the seismic behavior of a structure is highly influenced not only by the response of the superstructure, but also by the response of the foundation and the ground as well.Mylonakis, G., Gazetas, G., Nikolaou, S., and Michaelides, O. (2000b). The Role of Soil on the Collapse of 18 Piers of the Hanshin Expressway in the Kobe Earthquake, Proceedings of 12th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, New Zealand, Paper No. 1074  Hence, the modern seismic design codes, such as Standard Specifications for Concrete Structures: Seismic Performance Verification JSCE 2005 Japan Society of Civil Engineers. Standard Specifications for Concrete Structures – 2002: Seismic Performance Verification. JSCE Guidelines for Concrete No. 5, 2005 stipulate that the response analysis should be conducted by taking into consideration a whole structural system including superstructure, foundation and ground.

[[Margaret Stokes]]
CATEGORIES: 1832 births, 1900 deaths, Irish antiquarians, Members of the Royal Irish Academy, People from Dublin (city), Irish Protestants

Margaret McNair Stokes (March 1832–20 September 1900) was an Irish antiquarian noted for her illustrations. 
Born in Dublin, she was the daughter of Dr William Stokes and his wife Mary (née Black). One brother, Whitley Stokes, was a leading Celticist, a second, Sir William, followed their father into medicine and was a leading surgeon. Important figures in the field of antiquities such as artist Sir George Petrie, lawyer and poet Sir Samuel Ferguson, Edwin Wyndham-Quin, 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, and historians James Henthorn Todd and William Reeves were frequent visitors to the Stokes family home, and this is said to have begun Margaret's interest in Irish antiquities.
Her first published works were illustrations and illuminations for an 1861 edition of Ferguson's poem The Cromlech at Howth; the title page conflated parts of the illuminations on two pages of the Book of Kells. In the 1870s she edited Dunraven's Notes on Irish Architecture (3 volumes, 1875–1877) after the author's death in 1871. Her Early Christian Art In Ireland (1887, 2nd edition 1911) was well regarded, and if reviewer Oscar Wilde was unmoved by Stokes' prose, he praised her illustrations. She produced two works on early medieval Irish saints in Europe, Six Months in the Apennines (1892) and Three Months in The Forest of France (1895). Her  High Crosses of Ireland was incomplete at her death.
She was elected an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1876 and of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. 
She died at her home in Howth, County Dublin in 1900. Her papers are with Trinity College Dublin and the National Gallery of Ireland holds a chalk portrait by Walter Osborne.

Dos is the second album of Latin rap artist Gerardo.  It was released on September 15, 1992 on Interscope Records.  Unlike Mo' Ritmo, Gerardo's Dos was critically panned.  Alex Henderson, for instance, wrote that "this sophomore effort was a disappointment."  Likewise, Ron Wynn from Allmusic said in regards to Gerardo trying to follow up to the same success of Mo' Ritmo, "that you can only ride a fluke so long."
However, the album contains "Ven Michu Michu", a Spanish version of "Here Kitty Kitty", also from the album. A video was made for the song, and it is one of Gerardo's better known songs.

Peter Millar (1929 – 2003) was an American illustrator, cartoonist, and drag racer best known for his work with CARtoons and DRAGtoons magazines. Millar often used the pen names Arin Cee and Millarkey.  
What most aren't aware of is that Pete was a brilliant bronze sculptor with his main emphasis on early western art depicting dramatic scenes of horseback riding; featuring cowboys, bronc riders, mountain men, native Americans, and more, all of which are rare and highly collectible worldwide.  His pieces are signed and numbered, usually limited to 200-300 per sculpture. They often sell for thousands and one of his pieces was recently being offered in an art gallery in a famous Las Vegas casino.
His sculpting began after his daughter brought home some clay for a school art project! He had fun with the clay and progressed from there.  He was eventually commissioned by major gallery's to produce works for their clientele. If you find a Millar bronze then cherish and hang onto it for it is a very rare and valued find indeed!
Millar co-created the Petersen Publication CARtoons magazine in 1959, which ended its run in 1991. The first issue of CARtoons included the story of the hot rod community as a social collective and introduced the term Rumpsville. He worked on the project until 1963, when he was replaced by Hot Rod Magazine editor and Stroker McGurk creator Tom Medley.
In June 1963 Millar founded DRAGcartoons under the Millar Publications label. He worked on this project well into the 1970s . Millar Publications also produced four issues of the popular Ed "Big Daddy" Roth Magazine.

[[Minimum resolvable contrast]]

CATEGORIES: Image processing, Optics

Minimum resolvable contrast (MRC) is a subjective measure of a visible spectrum sensor’s or camera's sensitivity and ability to resolve data.  A snapshot image of a series of three bar targets of selected spatial frequencies and various contrast coatings captured by the UUT (Unit Under Test) are used to determine the MRC of the UUT, i.e. the visible spectrum camera or sensor. A trained observer selects the smallest target resolvable at each contrast level. Typically, specialized computer software collects the inputed data of the observer and provides a graph of contrast v.s. spatial frequency at a given luminance level. A first order polynomial is fitted to the data and an MRC curve of spatial frequency versus contrast is generated.Electro Optical Industries, Inc. (2005) EO TestLab Methodology.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
Iron making began in Upstate South Carolina just before the Revolutionary War. The iron making furnaces were located in areas that had deposits of iron ore and limestone, forests to supply wood to make charcoal, and water power to operate the bellows. In the 1850s, the local iron works faced increased competition from Northern furnaces using anthracite coal to produce iron that could be easily transported by rail.Edgar, Walter, ed. The South Carolina Encyclopedia, University of South Carolina Press, 2006, p. 485, ISBN 1-57003-598-9Early Ironworks of Northwestern South Carolina
The furnace was constructed around 1807. In 1834, it was purchased and rebuilt by the South Carolina Manufacturing Company, which was located in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. The furnace was operated until around 1850. Although the furnace has partially collapsed, parts of it are over [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] tall. In addition to the furnace, the road bed, a flat unloading area above the furnace, and heaps of ore, charcoal, and slag remain on the site.

The work featured thirteen lightning bolts ranging in height from 13 to 30 feet shooting into the ground on a site 180×160 feet. On a main sign like structure were four boxes 8×10×2 feet with images silk screened on the back dealing with social issues contemporary in nature. In front of these images and protected by clear LEXAN panels were neon tubes of a graffiti image that Lawless found on the side of a condemned building. These figures were a pun on the Planters Peanut character dressed up with a top hat and cane that could be interpreted as dancing penises. In the fourth box which was part of a sixty-second sequence the character removes his top hat and takes a bow to the crowd. Behind and above the main steel structure that held these boxes were four rows of brightly painted tin stars that spun in the wind, an obvious metaphor for the cosmos.
The sculpture was built in Buffalo, New York, over a period of two years and dedicated in November 1984. Construction of the work on its site started on October 6, and it was completed and lit on November 15. Some city officials found the work to be offensive, and Mayor Jimmy Griffin (politician) ordered it removed on November 20, 5 days later. Initial attempts at removing the sculpture began under the cover of night by a sign company with no knowledge of handling sculpture and resulted in significant damage to the work. The destruction of the sculpture was stopped when a New York State Supreme Court Justice, Vincent Doyle, issued an injunction and publicly denounced the actions of the Mayor in a hearing the following day.  Lawless sued, claiming that his rights were being infringed; the city contended that the sculpture, as erected, was not representative of the model they had been presented with. Billie Lawless won the lawsuit but was awarded no damages.
The sculpture was eventually removed from Buffalo and relocated to Chicago at Sculpture Chicago 1985, where it stood unmolested for ten years.
It is currently in storage in Cleveland, Ohio[ref]

[[Rio Grande Glaze Ware]]

CATEGORIES: Pueblo ceramics, Archaeology of the Americas, Pre-Columbian art

Rio Grande Glaze Ware is a late prehistoric and historic pottery tradition of the Puebloan peoples of New Mexico. The tradition involved painting pots with black paint made with lead ore; as the pots were fired the black paint fused and sometimes ran. The tradition lasted from AD 1315 to 1700. Rio Grande Glaze Ware was made or used in a number of villages from the Santa Fe area to the north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, and from the valley of the Rio Puerco east to the upper Pecos River Valley.
Archaeologists divide Rio Grande Glaze Ware into arbitrary types with much shorter life spans, primarily to help them date sites. Individual potsherds are assigned to types based on a combination of attributes, beginning with vessel rim profiles and proceeding to painted designs or vice versa.

Iowa scored on a 13-yard touchdown run from tailback Mike Saunders, opening up a 6-0 lead, for the first quarter's only points. In the second quarter, Saunders added a 5-yard run, putting the Hawkeyes up 13-0. Ty Detmer's 9 yard scoring strike to Peter Tuipuloto making it 13-6. In the fourth quarter, Detmer found Scotty Anderson for a 27 yard strike, as BYU evened the score at 13-13.
With 4:19 remaining in the game, BYU got the ball on their 23-yard line. After six plays, the Cougars reached the Hawkeye 18-yard line. The ensuing play resulted in Detmer's only interception when his pass deflected off his intended receiver and was intercepted by co-Defensive MVP Carlos James. Iowa then settled for the tie by not trying to advance the ball with their offense.
It was the first tie ever in the Holiday Bowl, and it was also the lowest scoring Holiday Bowl. It was the final college game for Detmer, who won the Heisman Trophy the previous season. This is also the last tie football game in major college football bowl history.

[[Timurite movement]]
CATEGORIES: History of the Soviet Union and Soviet Russia, Free labor, Child labour, Philanthropy, Youth organizations based in the Soviet Union

The Timurite movement or Timur movement (Тимуровское движение) was an altruistic youth volunteering movement in the Soviet Union promoted via mass youth organizations of Little Octobrists and Young Pioneers. The participants of the movement were called Timurites (тимуровцы, timurovtsy)."Timur Movement Among Soviet Youth", in: The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History, vol. 54, Academic International Press.
The idea of the movement was borrowed from the popular novel for youth Timur and His Squad by Arkady Gaidar. The youngster Timur and his squad clandestinely did good deeds: helped the families of the Red Army soldiers and combated the local gang of young  hooligans headed by Mishka Kvakin. At first Timur's squad was taken for hooligans as well, but eventually they earned gratitude. It was written in 1940, and quickly gained popularity, as other Gaidar's books. The same year a movie was released based on the novel. When the German invasion of the Soviet Union started in 1941, teams of Timurites all over the country, in addition to helping the families of soldiers, did large amounts of unskilled work: cleaning railways from snow, preparing firewood, loading/unloading cargo, etc.Jane Miller, "Eccentric Propositions: Essays on Literature and the Curriculum", 1984, ISBN 0-7100-9987-8, p. 48. Their activities were widely reported in newspapers and by radio.
The book was an obligatory part of school curriculum in the Soviet Union.
Later the Timurite movement was centralized and organized, with Central Staff and Congresses.
Timurite teams were also created in other socialist states: GDR, People's Republic of Bulgaria, People's Republic of Poland, North Vietnam and Czechoslovak Socialist Republic."Timurite movement"

The Soviet Story is a 2008 documentary film about Soviet Communism and Soviet–German collaboration before 1941 written and directed by Edvīns Šnore and sponsored by the UEN Group in the European Parliament.
The film features interviews with western and Russian historians such as Norman Davies and Boris Sokolov, Russian writer Viktor Suvorov, Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, members of the European Parliament and the participants, as well as the victims of Soviet terror.
Using these interviews together with historical footage and documents the film argues that there were close philosophical, political and organizational connections between the Nazi and Soviet systems before and during the early stages of World War II.[tpl]cite news |title=Telling the Soviet story |url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11401983  |work=The Economist |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2008-06-03 [/tpl] It highlights the Great Purge as well as the Great Famine, Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Katyn massacre, Gestapo-NKVD collaboration, Soviet mass deportations and medical experiments in the GULAG. The documentary goes on to argue that the successor states to Nazi Germany and the USSR differ in the sense that postwar Germany condemns the actions of Nazi Germany while the opinion in contemporary Russia is summarized by the quote of Vladimir Putin: "One needs to acknowledge, that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century".

[[German presidential election, 2009]]
CATEGORIES: Presidential elections in Germany, 2009 elections in Germany

An indirect presidential election was held in Germany on 23 May 2009. The President of Germany was elected by the Federal Assembly, which is made up of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of members nominated by the state Landtags.See Bundesversammlung for more details and references
The incumbent Horst Köhler (supported by CDU/CSU and FDP) stood for reelection and faced Gesine Schwan (supported by SPD and Alliance '90/The Greens).Bundespräsident Köhler will nochmals antreten (International, NZZ Online)
The Left (successor of the Party of Democratic Socialism) indicated they might be prepared to support Schwan if the SPD agreed to be open to cooperation with the Left on the federal level,http://www.n-tv.de/BundespraesidentenWahl_Linke_bieten_Tausch_an/020820082116/1003215.html but ultimately decided they would present their own candidate.http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1216918300242 The party nominated party activist and TV actor Peter Sodann on 14 October 2008; and it was left undecided whether the party would support Schwan if Sodann was eliminated after the first round of voting. 
Frank Rennicke was nominated as the joint candidate of the NPD and its sister party the DVU.
Following the Hesse state elections in January 2009, which strengthened CDU and FDP, and the Free Voters' promise to support Köhler, his reelection was seen as likely; however, CDU/CSU, FDP and Free Voters only had a slim majority in the Federal Assembly (50.16%), which made the election very competitive. In the end, Köhler was reelected in the first round of voting by 613 votes, which was exactly the minimum number of votes necessary. His nearest rival's, Social Democrat Gesine Schwan, received 503 votes making a second round unnecessary.[tpl]cite news   | title = German president wins re-election| publisher = BBC  | date = 23 May 2009  | url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm | accessdate = 23 May 2009[/tpl]  It has been seen by some as an important indicator for the federal elections in September.

A rodeo queen is a female representative and "face" of the sport of rodeo. She represents her rodeo, association, or region for a standard time of usually 12 months and is usually required to wear a cowboy hat, crown, and banner with her title on it. Being a rodeo queen requires skills in western style horse riding, public speaking, rodeo knowledge, appearance, and personality. Rodeo Queens spend their time professionally representing their title at various rodeos, parades, public events, television interviews, radio interviews, school events, and charity events.
There are three nationwide pageants in the United States, Miss Rodeo America, Miss Rodeo USA, and the National High School Rodeo Association Queen Contest.  In addition most states have their own pageants.  There are a number of qualifying pageants, local pageants, and contests for specific rodeo events.  Australia also hosts rodeo queens.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.qt.com.au/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3773365|publisher=The Queensland Times|title=Quest hopeful chases charity cash|date=May 23, 2008|author=Andrew Korner[/tpl] Rodeo associations can also hold queen pageants and crown rodeo queens such as Miss Rodeo New York and Miss Pennsylvania High School Rodeo Queen.
Most pageants require contestants to be single, childless, unmarried, under a certain age, and female. The most common major categories are appearance, horsemanship, knowledge, and personality, with a number of subcategories.  The winner is usually chosen from a field of multiple contestants and judged by a panel of qualified judges in each event. The young lady with the most amount of points will win the title.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rodeoroyalty.com/Coordinator/coordinating.htm|publisher=Rodeo Royalty|title=Coordinating the Rodeo Queen Pageant|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl]

Jen Stark (born 1983 in Miami, Florida) is a contemporary artist whose majority of work involves creating paper sculptures. She also works with drawing and animation. Her work draws inspiration from microscopic patterns in nature, wormholes, and sliced anatomy.Wired , Jen Stark's Paper Sculptures Explore Fractals, Wormholes, and Dead Bodies, May, 2008.  She studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), graduating Magna Cum Laude with a BFA majoring in Fibers with a minor in Animation.Official website , Jen Stark, May, 2008. 
Stark’s ideas are based on replication and infinity, echoing patterns and intelligent designs found in nature. Since expanding her medium from paper to include wood and even mirrors, Jen Stark's oeuvre of optically and methodologically baffling sculptures and drawings has enjoyed a renaissance of context. Her signature creations combine a variety of materials that have acted as a catalyst for more established spiritual proclivity as expressed through hypnotic mandala-like configurations. Jen Stark has exhibited her works in various galleries around the U.S. as well as the Girls' Club Collection, FL, the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale, FL and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Miami. She was a recipient of the prestigious South Florida Cultural Consortium's Visual and Media Artists Fellowship in 2008. Stark lives and works in Miami, Fl.

The EP reached number four in the New Zealand music charts, despite being listed in the singles chart (New Zealand has never had a separate EP chart), and stayed in the top 20 for nearly six months. 
As Flying Nun's first major success, it was largely responsible for the label's continued survival and the start of its growth into New Zealand's most important independent label.Dix, J.

[[15 Penn Plaza]]

CATEGORIES: Pennsylvania Plaza, Skyscrapers in Manhattan

15 Penn Plaza, also known as the Vornado Tower, was a proposed 68-story tower in the Midtown Manhattan district of New York City planned by Vornado Realty Trust. It would have had 430 units and 2,050,000 square feet (190,451 m²) of floor space.Satow, Julie. "Developers in New York Try to Ease Prickly Relations", The New York Times, March 15, 2011. Accessed March 17, 2011. "Mr. Paley’s first big deal in New York City has been an agreement with Vornado Realty Trust to develop 15 Penn Plaza, a proposed office tower that would replace the Hotel Pennsylvania on Seventh Avenue between 32nd and 33rd streets. Vornado is hoping to construct" a [tpl]convert|205,0000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] office building, "exceeding what is allowed under the current zoning." The Hiller Group is the designer. Despite only having 68 floors, it would be just 34 feet (10 m) shorter than the 81-year-old Empire State Building, which has 102 floors.
The Empire State Building's owner, Anthony Malkin, asked the City Council on August 24, 2010, to deny permission for the construction of the Vornado Tower. Malkin's reasoning is that the new building would alter the skyline and obscure the view of the western side of the Empire State Building. Located at Seventh Avenue between 32nd and 33rd Streets on the site of present-day Hotel Pennsylvania, opposite Pennsylvania Station – a major transit hub for the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, Amtrak and the New York City Subway – the proposed building would add a concourse improving access within Penn Station and adding several new subway entrances.Bagli, Charles V. "A Fight on New York’s Skyline", The New York Times, August 23, 2010. Accessed August 24, 2010. In exchange for increases in height and density for the building, Vornado would undertake $100 million in transit-related improvements that would reopen the "Gimbels passageway", which was blocked off in 1986 and would reconnect Penn Station to Herald Square at Sixth Avenue and the 34th Street – Herald Square station ([tpl]NYCS Herald Square[/tpl] trains) and the 33rd Street terminal of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train, which provides access to Hoboken and Journal Square trains. An updated passageway would be built to the standards of "the elegant and efficient passageways at Grand Central and Rockefeller Center" and would also have integrated access to the proposed New Jersey Transit terminal that would be constructed as part of the Access to the Region's Core tunnel that was to be constructed under the Hudson River.via Bloomberg News. "Vornado plans $100 million on Penn Station transit upgrades", The Star-Ledger, August 23, 2010. Accessed August 24, 2010.
The building would have been [tpl]convert|1216|ft[/tpl] in height, [tpl]convert|900|ft[/tpl] away, and [tpl]convert|34|ft[/tpl] shorter than the Empire State Building. Anthony and Peter Malkin, owners of the historic structure, had requested the creation of a 17-block exclusion zone that would prohibit large buildings from being built that would obstruct views of the Empire State Building and suggested that the proposed skyscraper be limited to [tpl]convert|825|ft[/tpl] in height. While Manhattan Community Board 5 voted overwhelmingly against the proposed project, the New York City Planning Commission approved the plan, which would allow the building to be 56% larger than standard zoning rules provide under special regulations that encourage the development of high-density office space near transit hubs. Opinion is divided about the plan, with Henry Stern, former Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation said the proposed building "could do irreparable harm" to the city, Daniel Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership joined union and construction officials in saying that "If there's anywhere a building of this size and bulk should be built, it's at Penn Station.
On August 25, 2010, in a 47–1 vote, the City Council voted to approve construction of the building, despite what The New York Times described as "a fierce public relations, advertising and lobbying campaign" by the owners of the Empire State Building to derail the project. The Council's zoning and land use committees approved the project and the full council overwhelmingly voted to approve the plan, with the only dissenter, Brooklyn Councilmember Charles Barron, voting in the negative as a protest against the absence of a guarantee by Vornado to hire minority and female construction workers.Bagli, Charles V. "New Skyscraper to Rival Empire State Building", The New York Times, August 25, 2010. Accessed August 25, 2010.
According to New York Post the building project has been suspended, with Vornado Realty Trust announcing it will instead renovate the Hotel Pennsylvania - the intended site for the 15 Penn Plaza tower - delaying the skyscraper until it becomes financially feasible to start construction. New York Post, December 14, 2011:Time-out seen in skyline war
On March 4, 2013, Vornado announced that it was abandoning plans to build the tower; instead it will "invest aggressively" into the Hotel Pennsylvania to make it into "a really profitable, really good hotel for our purposes."[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324539404578342754211087498.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Long Live Hotel Pennsylvania[/tpl]

[[WAI-ARIA]]

CATEGORIES: Accessible information, Ajax (programming), Web 2.0

[tpl]strong|WAI-ARIA[/tpl] (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a technical specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages, in particular, dynamic content and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript and related technologies. As of March 2014, it was a Recommendation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ |title=Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl]
Web developers increasingly use client-side scripts to create user interface controls that cannot be created with HTML alone. They also use client-side scripts to update sections of a page without requesting a completely new page from a web server. Such techniques on websites are called rich Internet applications. These user interface controls and content updates are often not accessible to users with disabilities, especially screen reader users and users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device. WAI-ARIA allows web pages (or portions of pages) to declare themselves as applications rather than as static documents, by adding role, property, and state information to dynamic web applications. ARIA is intended for use by developers of web applications, web browsers, assistive technologies, and accessibility evaluation tools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php |title=WAI-ARIA Overview |publisher=W3.org |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2012-12-06[/tpl]
WAI-ARIA describes how to add semantics and other metadata to HTML content in order to make user interface controls and dynamic content more accessible. For example, with WAI-ARIA it is possible to identify a list of links as a navigation menu and to state whether it is expanded or collapsed. Although originally developed to address accessibility issues in HTML, the use of WAI-ARIA is not limited to HTML: in principle, it can also be used in other markup languages such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG 1.2 Tiny added support for WAI-ARIA in the 15 September 2008 working draft.See SVG 1.2 Tiny: role attribute and SVG 1.2 Tiny: Extensible metadata attributes.
The Web Accessibility Initiative has published an overview of WAI-ARIA that introduces the subject and guides readers to the WAI-ARIA Suite documents:
The ARIA specifications editors have included Lisa Seeman, Rich Schwerdtfeger, James Craig, Michael Cooper and Lisa Pappas.

The offense was punishable by more than one year, but South Carolina considered it a misdemeanor, not a felony. Burgess then pleaded guilty for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine in Federal Court. At his sentencing, the judge applied to Burgess the "prior conviction" statute, which required a minimum twenty-year sentence for anyone with a prior "felony drug conviction." In Burgess' appeal to the Court he maintained that since South Carolina considered his first offense a misdemeanor the "prior felony drug conviction" did not apply. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal, holding that "felony" refers to any offense that is punishable for more than a year even if another jurisdiction classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.

The Marylander was a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) afternoon passenger train between New York City and Washington, D.C., operated by the B&O in partnership with the Reading Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey between Jersey City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Other intermediate cities served were Wilmington, Delaware, and Baltimore, Maryland.Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., Royal Blue Line.

Operating as #524 northbound and #525 southbound, the trains were called the New York Express and the Washington Express, respectively, in the 1910s and 1920s. The Marylander and its predecessors offered a high level of passenger amenities, such as parlor cars with private drawing rooms, full dining car service, deluxe lounge cars, and onboard radio and telephone service.

[[Communication-enabled business process]]

CATEGORIES: Business process

The goal of a communication-enabled business process (CEBP) is to optimize business process by reducing the human latency that exists within a process flow. For example, a mortgage approval process may be experiencing human latency because the person assigned to providing an approval is on vacation or busy working on something else. To reduce this latency, CEBP leverages unified communications  capabilities (i.e. UC services) by embedding them into the business process flow. The result is a more efficient, more automated closed-loop process; translating into significant ROI.
If the person does not provide the necessary approval within a designated period of time then the business process would invoke a UC service such as “notify and respond” from an IP PBX, voice portal/IVR, conferencing application, etc. These embedded UC services would “notify” the person that they need to do something. If the person does not “respond” to the notification then it can be escalated to a manager in the same manner.

Samite was a luxurious and heavy silk fabric worn in the Middle Ages, of a twill-type weave, often including gold or silver thread. The word was derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek  ἑξάμιτον hexamiton "six threads", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp.Oxford English Dictionary Online "samite" (subscription required), accessed 30 December 2010[ref]Lisa Mannas, Merchants, Princes and Painters: Silk Fabrics in Northern and Italian Paintings 1300–1550, Appendix I:III "Medieval Silk Fabric Types and Weaves", Yale University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-300-11117-0,
p. 297.[/ref]  Samite is still used in ecclesiastical robes, vestments, ornamental fabrics, and interior decoration.George E. Linton, The Modern Textile Dictionary, NY, 1954, pg. 561
Structurally, samite is a weft-faced compound twill, plain or figured (patterned), in which the main warp threads are hidden on both sides of the fabric by the floats of the ground and patterning wefts, with only the binding warps visible.Anna Muthesius, "Silk in the Medieval World".

[[Agias]]

CATEGORIES: 8th-century BC Greek people, 8th-century BC poets, Early Greek epic poets, Ancient Troezenians

Agias or Hagias ([tpl]lang-el|[tpl]lang|grc|Ἀγίας[/tpl][/tpl]) was an ancient Greek poet, whose name was formerly written Augias through a mistake of the first editor of the Excerpta of Proclus.[tpl]Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agias (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology  | volume = 1  | pages = 71  | publisher = Little, Brown and Company  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0080.html [/tpl]  This misreading was corrected by Friedrich Thiersch,Friedrich Thiersch, Acta Philol. Monac. ii. p. 584 from the Codex Monacensis, which in one passage has "Agias", and in another "Hagias".  The name itself does not occur in early Greek writers, unless it be supposed that the "Egias" or "Hegias" ([tpl]lang|grc|Ἡγίας[/tpl]) in Clement of AlexandriaClement of Alexandria, Stromata vi. p. 622 and Pausanias,Pausanias, Description of Greece i. 2. § 1 are only different forms of the same name.
Agias was a native of Troezen, and the time at which he wrote appears to have been about the year 740 BC.  His poem was celebrated in antiquity, under the name of Nostoi ([tpl]lang|grc|Νόστοι[/tpl]), i.e. the history of the return of the Achaean heroes from Troy, and consisted of five books.  The poem began with the cause of the misfortunes which befell the Achaeans on their way home and after their arrival, that is, with the outrage committed upon Cassandra and the Palladium; and the whole poem filled up the space which was left between the work of the poet Arctinus and the Odyssey.  The ancients themselves appear to have been uncertain about the author of this poem, for they refer to it simply by the name of Nostoi, and when they mention the author, they only call him "the writer of the Nostoi" ([tpl]lang|grc|ὁ τοὺς Νόστους γράψας[/tpl]).Athenaeus, vii. p. 281Pausanias, Description of Greece x. 28. § 4, 29. § 2, 30. § 2Bibliotheca ii. 1. § 5Scholiast, on the Odyssey iv. 12Scholiast, ad Aristoph. Equit. 1332Lucian, De Saltat. 46  Hence some writers attributed the Nostoi to Homer,Suda, s.v. [tpl]lang|grc|νόστοι[/tpl]Anthol. Planud. iv. 30 while others call its author a Colophonian.Eustathius of Thessalonica, on the Odyssey xvi. 118  Similar poems, and with the same title, were written by other poets also, such as Eumelus of Corinth,Scholiast, ad Pind. Ol. xiii. 31 Anticleides of Athens,Athenaeus iv. p. 157, ix. p. 466 Cleidemus,Athenaeus xiii. p. 609 and Lysimachus of Alexandria.Athenaeus iv. p. 158Scholiast, on Apollonius of Rhodes i. 558  Where the Nostoi'' is mentioned without a name, it was generally understood to have been the work of this Agias.

[[Tyler Brock]]
CATEGORIES: Asian Saga characters

Tyler Brock (1787-1863?) is a fictional character in the novel Tai-Pan. He is the Tai-pan, or "supreme leader" of Brock & Sons Trading Company, and the novel's antagonist. He is married to Liza Brock and has several children, including his sons Gorth, Morgan and Tom, and daughters Tess and Elizabeth. Brock is presented as a tough character, with a rough, Birmingham accent and an eyepatch. He competes fiercely with protagonist Dirk Struan, Tai-pan of Struan's Trading Company - known as the Noble House.
Brock's enmity with Struan precedes the events of the book. Brock, being older than Struan, was the 3rd mate on ship The Vagrant Star, on which Struan was a deckhand.  Brock whipped Struan and made his life on the ship hellish.  This ended one night when their ship hit a reef and sank. Brock and Struan survived, and each began to build their respective companies.
Brock lost an eye sometime prior to the book, when his vessel was hit by wind. He was pinned under a broken mastbeam and thrashed about the face by a loose halyard, whose metal-capped end gouged out his eye. Despite his overwhelming hatred for Dirk Struan he passes up outside assistance in bringing down the Noble House, preferring to do it himself.
Tyler Brock never gets his chance for vengeance, as Dirk Struan dies in a typhoon before there can be a reckoning.  In classic Shakespearean fashion Tyler's daughter Tess and Dirk's son Culum fall in love, getting married and condemning their fathers' hatred.  But Tyler Brock disowns his little girl, a grudging act that has terrible consequences.
Now part of the Noble House, Tess works with her husband Culum, now Tai-Pan of Struans, to further the Noble House and extract the vengeance that Dirk Struan would never have.  The novel leaves us at that, but future books in James Clavell's saga reveal the end of Tyler Brock.
When Culum dies, Tess takes over as Tai-Pan and orchestrates the fall of her father in 1863.  A penniless Tyler Brock is seen pirating a Chinese junk ship and sailing north, screaming promises to rebuild his fortune and come back for the coveted title of "Noble House."
He is never seen or heard from again.
John Stanton played Brock in the 1986 film Tai Pan. George MacDonald Fraser, who wrote an unused script adaptation of Tai Pan in the late 1970s, thought Oliver Reed would have been ideal casting for the role of Brock.George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p198-212

CATEGORIES: Pistol and rifle cartridges, Military cartridges

The 9×25mm Mauser (or 9mm Mauser Export) was a cartridge developed for the Mauser C96 service pistol. The cartridge was first produced by DWM in 1907 and later by German munitions makers Geco (Gustav Genschow & Co.) and RWS (Rheinische-Westfälische Sprengstoff AG) through World War II. Other manufacturers included Société Française des Munitions of Paris, France as well as various munitions factories in Austria and Hungary in the 1930s and 1940s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.municion.org/iphp/basedatos2.php?buscarpor=Pais&como=empiece+por|title=Municion.org Historical Ammunition Data|accessdate=2008-06-06[/tpl]
Mauser pistols in this relatively powerful caliber were primarily intended for export to Africa, Asia and South America. The 9mm Mauser Export cartridge was produced from 1907 to 1914 and then later from approximately 1930 to 1945.
The basis of this cartridge was the 7.63×25mm Mauser. The case length is the same as the 7.63×25mm Mauser, but the case is straight and does not have a bottleneck shape.  This cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case.Wilson, R. K. Textbook of Automatic Pistols, p.233. Plantersville, S.C.: Small Arms Technical Publishing Company, 1943.  The 9 mm Mauser should not be confused with the 9mm Parabellum (9x19mm Luger) or the 9x23mm Steyr.
As the German Army seemed to show more official interest in the P-08 Luger than the C-96, Mauser developed a new design. In 1906, Mauser introduced the Model 1906-08 (or C/06-08) pistol in 9×25mm Mauser caliber, which used a detachable box magazine of 6, 10 or 15 rounds. This pistol had a similar layout to the C-96, with the magazine situated in front of the trigger group, but incorporated a locking system that was considerably different. Interested purchasers included the German and Brazilian armies. The pistol was never manufactured for commercial sale.
In the 1930s a handful of Austrian, Hungarian and Swiss submachine guns and machine carbines were chambered for this caliber. Originally known as the Steyr-Solothurn S1-100, the Steyr MP30 and MP34 were adopted by the Austrian Army and police and manufactured until 1940.[tpl]cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg81-e.htm|title=Steyr - Solothurn S1-100 / MP-34 submachine gun (Switzerland/Austria)|accessdate=2008-06-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080422201701/http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg81-e.htm| archivedate= 22 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] SIG automatic carbine models MKMO, MKMS, MKPO and MKPS in this caliber were produced in Switzerland until the end of 1942. The Pál Király-designed Géppisztoly 39M and 43M in 9×25mm Mauser were produced by Danuvia in Hungary from 1939 through the end of World War II.

The 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS), the second round of the 2008 National League playoffs, was a best-of-seven baseball game series.  The series matched the NL West Champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the NL East Champion Philadelphia Phillies, who had home field advantage for this series due to their better regular-season record. The teams split their season series, with the home team sweeping their two four-game series in August.
The Phillies won the series, four games to one.  
The series opened on Thursday, October 9, 2008 at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, with the series being telecast on Fox.  
This series marked the first postseason meeting for the Phillies and Dodgers since the 1983 NLCS, which Philadelphia won 3–1 en route to a loss to Baltimore in the World Series. It also marked the first NLCS for both teams since the Division Series was instituted in 1995.  Overall, this was the fourth time these two teams had met in the postseason.  Prior to the 1983 NLCS, the Dodgers had defeated the Phillies 3–1 in the NLCS during both the 1977 and 1978 post-seasons.

Her discography consists of twelve studio albums, two compilation albums, two live albums, two holiday albums, and a collaborative album with Chet Atkins. Bogguss has released thirty-six singles, with six of those reaching the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. An additional six singles reached the Top 40 of the same chart.
Bogguss' breakthrough album, Aces, was released in 1991. It reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and featured four Top 15 singles on the country singles chart. The album was subsequently certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, without having charted a number one single. Her next two releases, Voices in the Wind (1992) and Something Up My Sleeve (1993), were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Sanford Wheeler (previously known as Matthew Wheeler) (born 6 April 1970 in California, United States) is a former Australian rules football player for the Sydney Swans.
He is notable as being the first African-American born player in the history of the AFL and one of few players from the United States to play in the Australian Football League.
Matthew Wheeler migrated with his Australian father and African-American mother to Sydney, New South Wales at the age of 5.  As a teenager, he began to take an interest in Aussie Rules and played his junior football for the Parramatta Aussie Rules club.
Recruited by the Sydney Swans as a rookie using their zone allocation, the athletic long haired Wheeler frequently exhibited some dash and flair off the wing and as a rugged rebounding defender off the half back flank.  His quick run and hard tackling were trademarks of his game. However his disposal skills let him down and he had a tendency to get caught holding the ball.
Midway through his career, he changed his first name by Deed poll to "Sanford".
Up to 1993, he had played 36 games and kicked 6 goals during the Swans' darkest era.
After a serious knee injury and being used sparingly by coach Ron Barassi, he was delisted after the 1994 season as part of a shake up of the Swans list.

[[War rape]]

CATEGORIES: War rape, War casualties, War crimes

War rapes are rapes committed by combatants during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation often as spoils of war; but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It is distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service."30% of Women in USA Military Raped Whilst Serving by Fellow Soldiers"[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 |title="The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers" |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title="Why Soldiers Rape – Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military" |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery by an occupying power.
During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. War rape is often systematic and thorough. War rape may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalised sexual slavery, war rapes associated with specific battles or massacres, and individual or isolated acts of sexual violence. War rape may also include gang rape and rape with objects.
Rape is also now recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group; however, rape remains widespread in conflict zones. There are other international legal instruments to prosecute perpetrators but this has occurred as late as the 1990s.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.

Syracuse scored first following a 2 yard Robert Drummond touchdown, and led 7-0 after 1 quarter. In the second quarter, Syracuse added a 38-yard field goal to take a 10-0 lead. LSU got on the scoreboard, following a 19-yard touchdown run by Calvin Windom getting to 10-7.
In the third quarter, David Browndyke kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the game at 10. Robert Drummond scored on a 1-yard run late in the third quarter as Syracuse led 17-10. Syracuse added a 4-yard touchdown pass from Todd Philcox to Deval Glover for a 23-10 lead. Syracuse held on to win by that same margin.
The loss marked the beginning of a dark period for LSU football. The Tigers recorded six consecutive losing seasons from 1989 through 1994, leading to the resignation of coach Mike Archer following the 1990 season and the dismissal of his successor, Curley Hallman, after four seasons. LSU did not return to a New Year's Day bowl game until 2001, by which time it had fired another coach, Gerry DiNardo.

Richard Frank Barker (born October 29, 1972) was a right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Barker's major league career consisted of just five games in the 1999 season.
Barker was drafted by the Cubs in the 37th round (1,030th overall) of the 1994 amateur draft out of Quinsigamond Community College. Only three other players drafted in that round made the majors-- Bronson Heflin, Matt Blank, and Mike Lincoln. Barker was one of only four Cubs draftees (out of 75) that year who eventually made the big leagues. The only player drafted later than Barker that year by the Cubs to make the leap was Kyle Farnsworth, a 47th round selection.
Barker made his debut with the Cubs on April 25, 1999, throwing 1[tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl] innings against the New York Mets and allowing one run on three hits. He'd make four more appearances in relief, including his final game on May 5, 1999. Barker's final statistics featured no wins, losses, or saves, an ERA of 7.20, four walks, and three strikeouts. After returning to the AAA Iowa Cubs after his cup of coffee with the parent club, Barker was unable to make it back to the majors. He pitched just 20 games in the minors in 2000 before he then retired from baseball due to an injury and moved to a beautiful suburb of Phoenix, Arizona and got married, only to start a successful small sports business.

Schir Johine the Ros, ane thing thair is compild, also known as The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie, is the earliest surviving exampleKinsley, James ed. William Dunbar, Poems OUP 1958, p.128 of the Scottish version of the flyting genre in poetry. The genre takes the form of a contest, or "war of words",Meier, Nicole, ed. The Poems of Walter Kennedy, Scottish Text Society, 2008. p.ci between two poets, each trying to outclass the other in vituperation and verbal pyrotechnics. It is not certain how the work was composed, but it is likely to have been publicly performed, probably in the style of a poetic joust by the two combatants, William Dunbar and Walter Kennedy, before the Court of James IV of Scotland.
There are clues in the poem that suggest some of the features that the show must have contained. Each of the combatants had a commissar, both of whom are named in the work and sometimes directly addressed by the performers. These are (respectively) Sir John the Ross for Dunbar and Quentin Shaw for Kennedy, both of whom were actual persons. Shaw (certainly) and Ross (probably) were also poets, and it seems possible that they played some material part in the performance.
Ross, Shaw, and Kennedy are all three named as a group in the closing stanzas of Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris.

The 1968 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Carlton Football Club and Essendon Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on Saturday, 28 September 1968.Australian Football.com - Carlton v Essendon AFL Tables: Carlton v EssendonBlueseum: Grand Final, 1968 It was the 72nd annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1968 VFL season. The match, attended by a record crowd of 116,828 spectators, was won by Carlton ("The Blues") by a margin of 3 points, making it that club's tenth premiership victory, but its first since winning the 1947 VFL Grand Final. 
The Blues emerged victorious despite Essendon kicking more goals, the only time that happened in a VFL Grand Final. There was a strong wind blowing during the whole game, which did not help it as a spectacle and possibly contributed to Carlton's inaccuracy. Garry Crane starred on the wing for the Blues with 30 possessions.
Essendon came within a point of Carlton at the 20 minute mark of the final term after a goal to Geoff Blethyn. Despite being goal-less in the final quarter, Carlton managed to keep their lead, thanks largely to 20th man Neil Chandler, who took some crucial marks in the dying stages.
The attendance of 116,828 was the highest at a VFL premiership decider up to that time, breaking the record of 115,803 spectators who witnessed the 1956 VFL Grand Final. However the new record was broken at the 1969 VFL Grand Final, and that record was broken in turn at the 1970 VFL Grand Final.

The Suaire de Saint-Josse, the "Shroud of Saint Josse" that is now conserved in the Musée du Louvre, Sheila S. Blair and Jonathan M. Bloom, "The Mirage of Islamic Art: Reflections on the Study of an Unwieldy Field", The Art Bulletin 85.1 (March 2003:152-184), p. 154, fig. 1. is a rich silk  samite saddle cloth that was woven in northeastern Iran, some time before 961, when Abu Mansur Bakhtegin, the "camel-prince" for whom it was woven, was beheaded. It was brought back from the First Crusade by Étienne de Blois and dedicated as a votive gift at the Abbey of Saint-Josse, near Caen, Normandy.  It has been described as "the major landmark in early Islamic silk weaving".Jones & Michell, p. 74
This fragmentary textile with elephants woven into the design is the only known surviving example of a silk textile produced in Eastern Iran, in the royal workshops of the Samanid dynasty, probably at either Merv or Nishapur.Louvre Museum: "The Saint-Josse Shroud". The "prince" referred to in the woven Kufic inscription, though decipherable in more than one way, is most likely to refer to the general and emir Bukhtegin, active in the service of 'Abd al-Malik I, the Samanid sultan of Khorasan, 954-61.
The cloth is now in two fragments, which are regarded as comprising about half of the original piece.  They are 52 x 94cm and 24.5 x 62cm respectively, the first measurement being the length.  The design was somewhat like a carpet (not that any from this date survive), with a central field containing two pairs of confronted elephants, one above the other, of which one pair survive. There is then a thin border with geometric patterns, outside which the sides have friezes of repeated camels and at least the bottom (which survives) an inscription in Kufic script. In all there are five zones of border between the elephants and the edge of the cloth.Jones & Michell, p. 74.  The image in Jones appears to be a photo-reconstruction, as more is shown than in the Louvre's photograph. 
Like many trophies of foreign adventure, both in the Middle Ages and in more modern times, in its new context, the rare textile was given new meaning, for it was used to wrap the bones of Saint Josse when he was reinterred in 1134.M. Bernus, H. Marchal, and G. Vial, "Le Suaire de St-Josse", Bulletin de Liaison du Centre International d'Études des Textiles Anciens 33 (1971:1-57).
When the Abbey of Saint-Josse was secularised just before the French Revolution,The Abbey of Saint-Josse was closed in 1772, sold and then deismantled in 1789, leaving no traces of the monumental buildings. the abbey church became the parish church of the French commune of Saint-Josse;  the suaire was kept there until it was transferred to the Louvre.

[[Distributed language]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics

Distributed language represents an externalist perspective on human cognition. Instead of tracing communication to individual knowledge of a symbolic system, language-activity is taken to sustain the human world.  Extending work by Humberto Maturana, priority is given to how face-to-face interaction draws on multimodal activity or languaging .1 As people language together, they gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in a range of activities in which wordings play a part. Over time, these activities construct and maintain language as a whole. Distributed language thus links a biological theory of the origin of language to distributed cognition. Human cognitive and communicative abilities arise as people do things together while drawing on material, linguistic and other resources. Language activity is constrained by biology, circumstances, and collective ways of life. While bodies sustain coordination, our lived realities are extended by the resources of a partly shared collective world. Thus, language cannot be separated from the artifacts and institutions or the behaviour of the living beings who undertake collaborative (and solo) tasks. This distributed perspective challenges the mainstream view that language use can be explained by individual competencies and microsocial rules. To ascribe 'language' to individual organisms is, on the distributed perspective, an error. Building on cognitive science, the perspective challenges cognitive internalism by presenting language as a prime case of embodied and culturally embedded cognition. It emphasizes that the heterogeneity of human language does much to shape people, mind and society.

Nyctibatrachus minimus is a species of frog in the Ranidae family. It is the smallest known frog in the genus Nyctibatrachus and was recently discovered from Kurichiyarmala in the Western Ghats or Wayanad, Kerala. 
Its most distinctive feature is the small adult snout-vent length, averaging only 12.3 mm in adult males (N = 15). 
Miniaturization in Nyctibatrachus species seems to be associated with absence of webbing on toes and fingers, which may have resulted from evolutionary specialization to life in terrestrial habitats.[ref]Biju, S. D., Ines Van Bocxlaer, Varad B. Giri, Kim Roelants, J. Nagaraju and

Tom Brown's School Days is a 1940 coming-of-age drama film about a teenage boy's experiences at Rugby School, Warwickshire in the early 19th century under the reforming headmastership of Thomas Arnold. It stars Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Freddie Bartholomew and Jimmy Lydon in the title role. The film was based on the 1857 novel of the same name by Thomas Hughes.
In this version, emphasis is placed on the development of Headmaster Thomas Arnold and his reformist ideas concerning the English public school.[tpl]cite journal|title= Tom Brown's School Days; Adventures at Rugby|date=January 1, 1940|publisher=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117795775.html|accessdate=December 6, 2008[/tpl] It was well received by critics, with Variety praising it in a January 1940 review as "sympathetically and skillfully made, with many touching moments and an excellent cast". Hardwicke's performance as Arnold was called "one of the best he has ever given," as the veteran actor convincingly tempered the headmaster's strict demeanor with "the underlying sympathy, tolerance, quiet humour and steadfast courage" for which Arnold was acclaimed. Jimmy Lydon as the title character was called "believable and moving in the early portions, but too young for the final moments".
The June 27, 1940, debut of the film version at New York City's Radio City Music Hall was chronicled in a photo spread by The New York Times, "showing some of the pastimes, curricular and otherwise", as the fight scene between Tom Brown and Flashman was captioned.[tpl]cite news|title=Reflections of passing events in the screen world|date=June 23, 1940|publisher=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=FA0C17FB345D10728DDDAA0A94DE405B8088F1D3|accessdate=2009-01-23 | format=PDF[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Map types, Physical geography

Hachures [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|ʊər|z[/tpl] are an older mode of representing relief. They show orientation of slope, and by their thickness and overall density they provide a general sense of steepness. Being non-numeric, they are less useful to a scientific survey than contours, but can successfully communicate quite specific shapes of terrain. They are a form of shading, although different from the one used in shaded maps. 
Hachure representation of relief was standardized by the Austrian topographer Johann Georg Lehmann in 1799.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0701/althillshade.html |title= New Tools Produce Classic Cartographic Effects |author= Patrick J Kennelly and A Jon Kimerling |accessdate=2010-07-22 |year=2001[/tpl] Hachures may be combined with other ways of representing relief, like shades, the result being a shaded hachure map; an example of such a map is the Dufour Map of Switzerland.Dufour Map from The Federal Office of Topography of Switzerland[tpl]dead link|date= July 2010[/tpl] Emil von Sydow designed maps with coloured hachures: green for lowlands and brown for highlands.

Charles J. Bastian (July 4, 1860 – January 18, 1932) was a right-handed infielder in four different major baseball leagues in the 19th Century. The light-hitting Bastian toiled for a total of six teams in the Union League, National League, Players League, and American Association during an eight-year career.
Debuting with the Wilmington Quicksteps in 1884, Bastian played just 17 games before moving on to Union Association rival Kansas City Cowboys, where he tallied another eleven. After the demise of the UA, Bastian signed with the Philadelphia Quakers of the National League. He became the club's everyday shortstop, playing 103 games but hitting only .167 with 4 home runs and 29 RBI. He also led the league in strikeouts with 82. Despite this, in 1886, Bastian became the regular second baseman for the Quakers. His production increased a bit as he hit .217 with 2 home runs and 38 RBI, and he placed in the league's top ten in triples. However, as his offense was still subpar, Bastian lost his starting job for 1887, remaining with the team as a utility infielder that season and the next.
The Chicago White Stockings (predecessors of the Cubs) were Bastian's next stop, as they purchased him from Philadelphia. With the Cubs, Bastian's performance bottomed out. He batted a career-low .135 and played in just 46 games. Bastian jumped to the fledgling Players' League in 1890, signing with the Chicago Pirates, where he was once again an everyday shortstop. However, his lack of offensive production continued to plague him, as Bastian failed to hit .200 for a third consecutive season.
Bastian played a game each for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers and his old Philadelphia Quakers, now the Philadelphia Phillies, in 1891 before hanging up his glove after his final appearance on August 22. In a 504-game career, Bastian hit just .189 with eleven home runs and 144 RBI.
Bastian died on January 18, 1932 in Pennsauken, New Jersey.

[[Corsica wine]]
CATEGORIES: Corsica, Wine regions of France, Corsica wine AOCs

Corsica wine is wine made on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. Located 90 km west of Italy, 170 km southeast of France and 11 km north of the island of Sardinia, the island is a territorial collectivity of France, but many of the region's winemaking traditions and its grape varieties are Italian in origin. The region's viticultural history can be traced to the island's settlement by Phoceans traders in 570 BC in what is now the commune of Aléria. In the 18th century, the island came under the control of France. Following the independence of Algeria from French rule, many Algerian Pieds-Noirs immigrated to Corsica and began planting vineyards. Between 1960 and 1976 the vineyard area in Corsica increased fourfold. In 1968, Patrimonio was established as Corsica's first Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). Today, Corsica has nine AOC regions including the island-wide designation Vin de Corse AOC. The majority of the wine exported from Corsica falls under the Vin de pays designation Vin de Pays de l'Île de Beauté (Country wine from the Island of Beauty). The three leading grape varieties of the region are Nielluccio, known as the spice wine of France, Sciacarello and Vermentino.J.

[[Ngo Dinh Diem presidential visit to Australia]]

The Ngo Dinh Diem presidential visit to Australia from 2 to 9 September 1957 was an official visit by the first President of the Republic of Vietnam.Ham, p. 57. It was part of a year of travelling for Diem, who made official visits to the United States and other anti-communist countries.Jacobs, pp. 100–104. As with his American trip, Diem was warmly and lavishly received during the height of the Cold War, garnering bipartisan praise from both the Liberal Party of Australia of Prime Minister Robert Menzies and the opposition Australian Labor Party (ALP).
Diem addressed the Parliament of Australia and was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, one of the highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also British subjects. Diem did not engage in substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and he spent most of his time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his authoritarianism, election fraud and other corrupt practices. The Australian Catholic leadership and media were particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diem had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.
Diem's visit was a highmark in relations between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diem became unpopular with his foreign allies, who began to criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By the time of his assassination, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam and opposition to the war grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.

[[Commercial Import Program]]
CATEGORIES: Economy of Vietnam, South Vietnam, United States–Vietnam relations, 1955 establishments in South Vietnam, 1975 disestablishments

The Commercial Import Program, sometimes known as the Commodity Import Program (CIP), was an economic aid arrangement between South Vietnam and its main supporter, the United States. It lasted from January 1955 until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the dissolution of South Vietnam following the invasion by North Vietnam after US forces had withdrawn from the country due to the 1973 cease-fire agreement. The initiative was a trading plan that was designed to inject large amounts of American capital into the South Vietnamese economy to help fuel its industrialisation, growth and self-sufficiency, without incurring the high levels of inflation that would normally occur in such a drastic injection of money.
The CIP was a scheme whereby US dollars were given to the South Vietnamese government treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.
The main effect of the aid package was to fuel a rapid expansion in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials were aware of the failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.

Historically a part of Lancashire, the name Shuttleworth is believed to derive from Sceot-hulls-worth, implying an Anglo-Saxon "dwelling-place by the Scout hills".[tpl]Harvnb|Chetham Society|1856|p=260[/tpl]. The prefix is sceotan, Old English for "shot", and the suffix -worth (also Old English) means "enclosure". During the Middle Ages, Shuttleworth lay within the township of Walmersley (sometimes called Walmersley-cum-Shuttleworth), parish of Bury, and hundred of Salford. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the area became a civil parish, but in 1933  was dissolved and amalgamated into the Ramsbottom Urban District.
Shuttleworth is bounded to the south by Holcombe Brook and Summerseat; to the north by Edenfield, Irwell Vale; to the west by Holcombe and Ramsbottom and to the east by Stubbins, Turn Village and Shuttleworth-cum-Turn.

The band issued three albums, Horsehead (1993), Onism (1996) and Goodbye Mothership (1999) before disbanding in 2000. According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, their style of "stadium rock mixed a Led Zeppelinesque bottom-end kick with gut-thumping Faith No More-styled riffs. Nothing subtle or innovative, but everything delivered with great force and conviction".

Berisford "Shep" Shepherd (Jan 19, 1917 - ) is an American jazz musician.
Shepherd's parents were from the West Indies. His father took a job working on the Panama Canal and sent his pregnant wife to Philadelphia; Shep Shepherd was born en route, in Honduras, and despite his Caribbean background grew up in a largely Jewish neighborhood in Philadelphia.
Shepherd had an early interest in music, particularly drumming, and could read sheet music for drums by the age of 14, and began to take on paid gigs. Music was not his sole focus; attending a vocational high school, he trained as a cabinet maker. As a touring musician, he apparently carried cabinet making tools and a fishing pole in addition to his instruments.
In the 1930s, Shepherd worked in Philadelphia for band leader Jimmy Gorham.

[[Al-Mu'ayyad]]

CATEGORIES: Abbasids, 866 deaths, Murdered royalty, Year of birth unknown, People executed by the Abbasid Caliphate, Heirs apparent who never acceded

Al-Mu'ayyad (died 866) was the third son of the Abbasid caliph, al-Mutawakkil and the brother of al-Muntasir and al-Mu'tazz, who both would eventually become Caliphs as well. 
In 860, al-Mutawakkil had named his three sons heirs and seemed to favour al-Muntasir. However, this appeared to change and al-Muntasir feared his father was going to move against him. With the implicit support of the Turkish faction of the army, he ordered the assassination of al-Mutawakkil which was carried out by a Turkish soldier on December 11, 861. 
The Turkish party then prevailed on al-Muntasir to remove his brothers from the succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. In their place, he was to appoint his son as heir-apparent. On April 27, 862 both brothers, al-Mu'ayyad and al-Mu'tazz, wrote a statement of abdication. 
Al-Muntasir's reign lasted for half a year and ended with his death of unknown causes on 862. After the death of al-Muntasir, the Turkish chiefs assembled in a council to select his successor. They did not want to elect al-Mu'ayyad or any of the brothers; so they elected al-Musta'in, another grandson of al-Mu'tasim.
In 866, al-Musta'in was deposed and al-Mu'tazz came into power. Immediately upon becoming the new Caliph, al-Mu'tazz had the former Caliph al-Musta'in executed. The Turkish soldiery, after a brawl with the Maghariba troops, now turned their support to al-Mu'ayyad. Enraged by this predicament, the jealous Caliph had his brother, al-Mu'ayyad, being next heir to the throne, imprisoned along with another brother, Abu Ahmad, who had bravely led the troops in the late struggle on his side. 
The Turks attempted his release, but al-Mu'tazz, the more alarmed, resolved on his death. He was smothered in a downy robe (or, as others say, frozen in a bed of ice); and the body was then exposed before the Court, as if, being without mark of violence, he had died a natural death, (a transparent subterfuge). 
This period saw the rise of a legend that an Abbasid prince had converted to Christianity under the influence of Theodore of Edessa, taken the name "John" and been killed for his apostasy; Alexander Vasiliev speculates that Muayyad, who was killed in 866 by his brother Mu`tazz, may have been the convert. However, there is no Christian or Muslim record remotely associating Muayyad with Christianity or even, indeed, religious speculation. The motives for his murder seem to have been purely political; had he indeed converted, it would have given Mutazz an excuse to murder him for apostasy and been recorded.Joseph Patrich, The Sabaite Heritage in the Orthodox Church, Peeters Publishers, 2001, ISBN 90-429-0976-5, Google Print, p. 157.

[[Basic Occupational Health Services]]

CATEGORIES: Occupational safety and health organizations

The Basic Occupational Health Services are an application of the primary health care principles in the sector of occupational health. Primary health care definition can be found in the World Health Organization Alma Ata declaration from the year 1978 as the “essential health care based on practical scientifically sound and socially accepted methods, (…) it is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and community with the national health system bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work (…)”.
An effort was launched by the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) to develop Basic Occupational Health Services, since occupational health services are available to only 10-15% of workers worldwide. Even where services are available, their quality and relevance may be low. Basic Occupational Health Services are most needed for countries and sectors that do not have services at all or which are seriously underserved.

Hailing from New-Delhi India, Musafir-the-band streamlines the contemporary Hindi pop and folk sound, adding an arena-rock sincerity that’s well consented by its fans as ‘Indian-Pop-Rock’.
The band’s youthful attitude and emotive style, personified by front man Ashutosh’s dulcet vocals, and steady strings of radio-friendly rocks and manly ballads give Musafir’s music a presence, relished by the listeners of diverse genres.
The group came together in the 2006. Lead singer Ashutosh Jain returning from Fame Gurkul – 2, set up a Music studio, joined by Rakesh Mandal and Kundan Messey, the experts who also had immense industry experience, just like Ashutosh. Amazed by the output, they decided to take music-business forward and created a live band line-up. The band completed when joined Arjun Desai on Guitars and Ravi Singh on Drums.
Playing live since 3 years and performed nearly 200 shows, Musafir is also known for on-stage skills and Sensational Live acts. Their brand of fresh rock sound blends to create an experience, which is being hailed by many as the Next BIG THING in the Indian music scene.
Musafir is led by Fame gurukul part 2 (Fame X) fame Ashutosh, who has learned the tricks of the trade from the industrial big shots like Palash Sen, Daler Mehndi, Soumya Rao and Ganesh Hegde.
Musafir describing their music:
“We are nothing unusual, we do not sing about Death, graves or blood, we are experimental only up to the mark of positivity. We believe in beauty, happiness and talent. Our songs are beautiful with amazing lyrics, great motif lines and an element of Rock, adoptable by every one. We have kept balance among innovation, saleablity and originality of our thoughts.”
Ashutosh, on his energy level while performing:
”I’d do anything. I’d damn run across the audience in the stadium, to fix the microphone on the mouth of last man in the last row, to sing along with me. I’ve climbed lighting gears, I’ve jumped from the 8-10 ft elevated stages, I’ve laid down my guitar and picked a Dhol, singing for 4 hrs continuously nearly kills you, that’s crazy, but that’s what I like, bringing smile on their faces.”

Xuanmiao Temple (Chinese: 玄妙观; Pinyin: Xuánmiào Guàn, "Mysterious Sublimity Temple" or "Mysterious Essence Temple") is a prominent Taoist temple with a long history, located at the center of old Suzhou City.
The street along east-west direction in front of the temple is called Guanqian Street (观前街), a famed business pedestrian street in Suzhou. A lane called Gong Xiang (宫巷) along north-south direction leads directly to the gate.
Xuanmiao Temple was founded in Xianning 2nd year (AD 276), Western Jin Dynasty, and was initially named "Zhen Qing Dao Yuan" (真庆道院). It was destroyed by wars in Southern Song Dynasty. It was rebuilt in the Chunxi era (1174–1189) of the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song, and was renamed Xuanmiao Guan in 1264. During the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty, the temple was renamed Yuanmiao Guan (元妙观) to avoid naming taboo because the emperor's personal name, Xuanye (玄烨), contained the Chinese character xuan (玄).
The first structure of the temple that visitors see is the Zheng Shan Men. It is built entirely from wood. The Zheng Shan Men is aligned south to north, with the main entrance facing south. It has two side entrances, in the east and west. The temple dates back to the Tang Dynasty. It suffered some damages in the eighteenth century and had to be rebuilt in 1775. The temple houses six statues of Taoist gods. There are also idols of four marshals and two generals. The temple's flank has a tablet commemorating the restoration of the temple.[tpl]cite web|title=Xuanmiao Taoist Temple (Temple of Mystery)|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/jiangsu/suzhou/xuanmiao-taoist-temple.htm|publisher=Travel China Guide|accessdate=10 February 2014[/tpl]

[[God Is My DJ]]
CATEGORIES: 1999 albums, Alice (singer) albums

God Is My DJ is the fifteenth studio album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in 1999 on WEA/Warner Music.
After the release of two pop albums, Charade in 1996 and Exit in 1998, Alice again changed musical direction and set out on a low-key tour with a six-piece acoustic band performing in smaller venues and churches in the North of Italy, interpreting sacral - but not exclusively religious - music. As the singer writes in the liner notes: "This is not an exploration of spiritual music as such but rather a search for the spirit in music." The partly instrumental concert God Is My DJ, which later was recorded in studio and released on Warner Music, comprises works by composers as diverse as Arvo Pärt, David Crosby, Popol Vuh, Gavin Bryars, Franco Battiato and Jane Siberry, French, Hungarian and Livonian traditionals as well as eleventh and fourteenth century hymns sung in Ancient Greek and Latin. 
Gabriel Fauré's "Pie Jesu" was first recorded on the 1988 classical album Mélodie passagère, the French folk song "Orléans" on the pop album Il sole nella pioggia in 1989 and the Hungarian "Istenem Istenem" (as part of "In viaggio sul tuo viso") and "Madre notte" ("Mother Night") both on 1992's Mezzogiorno Sulle Alpi. Franco Battiato's original version of "L'oceano di silenzio" ("The Ocean of Silence") was included on his 1988 album Fisiognomica, which also featured his version of Alice's "Nomadi", and "L'ombra della luce"  on 1991's Come un camello in una grondaia and later also on the EMI Classical volume Shadow, Light. Eleni Karaindrou's "Refugee's Theme" is originally from the soundtrack to Theo Angelopoulos' film The Unsuspended Step of the Stork.
Among the songs originally performed as part of the God Is My DJ concert but not included on the studio album were Peter Gabriel's 1989 instrumental "With This Love" from the album Passion: Music for The Last Temptation of Christ, the hymns "Planctus Mariae Et Aliorum in Die Parasceven" and "Crucifixio Iesu Christi Domini nostri Mysterium Crucis", "Il cielo sopra il cielo" from Alice's preceding album Exit, the title track from 1989's Il sole nella pioggia, "Dammi la mano amore" from 1995's Charade and "Nomadi" from 1986's Park Hotel.

[[Sartuul]]

CATEGORIES: History of Mongolia, Mongol peoples

Sartuul ([tpl]Lang-mn|Сартуул[/tpl]) is one of the Mongol clans. Today, they primarily live in the Zavkhan Province of Mongolia. 
The origin of the Sartuul people is Turkic merchants and artisans from Khwarizm. According to Pelliot, Sartuul means merchant in plural. Mongols called Muslim merchant a Sart or the place he came from as Sartagchinii gazar. After the Mongol invasion of Central Asia, many Khwarizmi and other Turks settled in Mongolia. They were loyal to Batmunkh Dayan khan and his successors. And they were appointed as one clan of Khalkhas. Sartuul people had already mixed with Mongols.
After the death of Gersenz Huntaiji, who was a son of Batmunkh Dayan Khaan, his wife divided Khalkha Mongol among her 7 sons. One of his sons, Daldan hundlun received Tangud (Descendants of Xi xia dynasty) and the Sartuul tribes. Since then, Chingissid princes from House of Daldan hundlun had ruled them. Some of them moved to northern Mongolia around Baikal a few decades later and mixed with the ancestors of the Buryats. 
9 khutagts of Khalkha and 2 presidents of Mongolia are from Sartuul. Today Sartuul Khalkhas are numerous and divided into 22 subclans that dwell on Zavkhan province.
There is a saying in Mongolia that Sartuul means Sartai Uul (Mountain with the Moon). This is a doubtful theory based on the spelling or accent of the name. It may come from "Sart oolu" which means "child of Sart" in Turkic.

QUIET is an astronomy experiment to study the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation. QUIET stands for Q/U Imaging ExperimenT. The Q/U in the name refers to the ability of the telescope to measure the Q and U Stokes parameters simultaneously.  QUIET is located at an elevation of 5,080 metres (16,700 feet) at Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in the Chilean Andes. It began observing in late 2008 and finished observing in December 2010.{{cite arXiv | eprint=1012.3191 | version=v2 | title=First Season QUIET Observations: Measurements of CMB Polarization Power Spectra at 43 GHz in the Multipole Range 25 QUIET is the result of an international collaboration that has its origins in the CAPMAP, Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and QUaD collaborations.

Big Sound Authority were an English pop band.
The group was formed in 1983 after Tony Burke (ex-Directions) and Julie Hadwen both wrote to Paul Weller who was looking for new artists for his then emerging Respond Records label. Hadwen replied to the same advertisement as Tracie Young. Weller introduced them to each other and the newly formed Big Sound Authority recorded the song "History of the World" for a Respond Records compilation album, Love The Reason. They toured with other Respond artists such as Tracie and The Questions and were offered a recording contract by Weller, but decided to turn it down.  
They signed instead for the MCA Records imprint Source Records in 1984, and released "This House (Is Where Your Love Stands)" in 1985, which was their biggest hit. The band split up in 1986, after releasing three more singles and an album, An Inward Revolution.
They supported The Kane Gang on tour in 1984, and in 1985 appeared at the Montreux Jazz Festival and the British Big Sound Authority tour. TV appearances included Top of the Pops, Oxford Road Show, The Tube, The Old Grey Whistle Test, and Wogan. They also did Radio One sessions for both Bruno Brooks and Janice Long.
A live DVD, This House Is Where Your Love Stands, named after their biggest hit, was released in 2006.

John Sargent (24 December 1750, Salem - 24 January 1824) was an American Loyalist during American Revolution.  
A Methodist merchant from Salem, Massachusetts, he was the second son of Colonel Epes Sargent, by his second wife, the widow Katharine Browne (a granddaughter of Governor John Winthrop and governor's Thomas Dudley and Joseph Dudley), brother to one distinguished Revolutionary war soldier, Paul Dudley Sargent, and uncle to another, Winthrop Sargent.  He is the very first signatory among the Salem Addressers of Governor Thomas Gage on his arrival in Salem in 1774, and thus during the American Revolution he was proscribed and exiled in the Banishment Act of the State of Massachusetts in 1778.  He went to Barrington, Nova Scotia, where he had three sons and a daughter (having married the widow Margaret Barnard in Boston in 1784) and attended the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th General Assemblies of Nova Scotia.
Sargent died in Barrington at the age of 73.
His sons John, William Browne and Winthrop also served in the assembly.

[[Collegiate fencing]]
CATEGORIES: West Point Fencing Invitational, College fencing in the United States, Student sport

Collegiate fencing has existed for a long time. Some of the earliest programs in the US came from the Ivy League schools, but now there are over 100 fencing programs in the US. Both clubs and varsity teams participate in the sport, however only the varsity teams may participate in the NCAA championship tournament. Due to the limited number of colleges that have fencing teams, teams fence inter-division (teams from Division I schools to Division III), and all divisions participate in the NCAA Championships. 
Collegiate fencing tournaments are "team tournaments" in a sense, but contrary to what many people expect, collegiate meets are not run as 45-touch relays. Schools compete against each other one at a time. In each weapon and gender, three fencers from each school fence three fencers on the opposing team in five-touch bouts. (Substitutions are allowed, so more than three fencers per squad can compete in a tournament.) A fencer's individual results in collegiate tournaments and regional championships are used to select the fencers who will compete in NCAA championships. Individual results for fencers from each school are combined to judge the school's overall performance and to calculate how it should be placed in a given tournament.

[[High school fencing]]
CATEGORIES: Fencing in the United States, High school sports in the United States, Fencing organizations

Fencing at the high school level has varied in popularity. Fencing was once part of many schools' physical education curriculum, and many schools had clubs and would compete in inter-school tournaments. In the second half of the 20th century, fencing gradually faded from physical education curricula in the United States. This has been attributed to worries about 'weapons in schools' or that it requires expensive equipment[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]. Fencers, of course, dispute the characterization of fencing foils as weapons since they fail to meet the applicable criteria  - a tool of injury or destruction - since foils are engineered specifically to contact the human body without injury.
However, youth fencing has remained a club sport at some schools, and the last several years have seen an increase in fencing clubs and tournaments at the high school level. The United States Fencing Association has encouraged this through the Regional Youth Circuit program.US Fencing Youth Development Website, Regional Youth Circuit High school fencing season is generally in winter.United States Fencing Organization 
In many European countries fencing is growing more popular each year. In Scotland many new competitions have arisen to get these new fencers into fencing at higher levels, such as the Leon Paul Youth Development series where fencers fit in as much fencing as possible against as many of those in their age and weapon group to gain experience.
High school fencing has also gained a renewed following in the United States, evidenced by the establishment of state leagues, an increase in Junior level national competitors, and in 2011 the establishment of a National High School Championship in Cleveland, Ohio.
High school competitive fencing has grown significantly in the state of New Jersey, one of the few states where it remains a varsity sport. The league is growing steadily, and there are currently 55 varsity programs in the state.[tpl]Citation | title = New Jersey Interscholastic Fencing Association | url = http://njifa.org/index1.php | accessdate = 2012-03-01[/tpl]
Georgia in particular has seen growing interest in high school fencing. The Georgia High School Fencing League was founded in 2004 and in the 2013-14 season numbers 17 schools and over 350 fencers. Member schools hold their own practices and come together about once a month during the fall and winter seasons to fence other member schools, primarily in épée. Additionally, the On Guard High School League of Georgia was created to allow high school fencers to fence all three weapons (épée, foil and sabre). This league was formed in 2010 in the 2012-13 season numbered seven schools and over 150 fencers.
The North Carolina Fencing League has grown to include Chapel Hill High School, Elkin High School, Morehead High School, East Chapel Hill High School, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Bishop McGuinness High School in Kernersville, Cape Fear Fencing Association of Wilmington, Salem Academy, Reynolds High School and even a non-North Carolina school, Carlisle Preparatory Academy in Martinsville, Virginia.  The latest champion of the league is Chapel Hill High; prior to that, East Chapel Hill won.

He spent the early 1970s in Tasmania as playing coach of Sandy Bay. In what would be the club's strongest era he steered them to the 1971 and 1972 TFL premierships and to another Grand Final in 1973, which they lost despite winning 20 consecutive games that year. As a player he also had success and was a William Leitch Medalist in both 1971 and 1973.

The Dunn Brothers were a group of brothers from Pawnee, Oklahoma who worked as Old West bounty hunters. They are best known for having killed George "Bittercreek" Newcomb and Charley Pierce, members of the Wild Bunch.
The brothers - Bee, Calvin, Dal, George and Bill Dunn - ran a boarding house near Ingalls and a meat market in Pawnee. Bill Dunn was the leader, and the oldest of the brothers. By the 1890s the Dunn brothers were working as bounty hunters, although they had been involved in cattle rustling and robbery. Their teenage sister Rose became romantically involved with "Bittercreek" Newcomb, having met him through her brothers. On May 2, 1895, when Newcomb and Charley Pierce rode up to the Dunn house to visit with Rose, the brothers shot and killed both outlaws as they dismounted. They then collected the bounty on both, believed to have been $5,000 each, mostly due to the notoriety of the gang by that time.
It is believed that on August 25, 1896, Bill Dunn led Deputy US Marshal Heck Thomas to the hideout of Bill Doolin. Some have speculated that Dunn murdered Doolin; however, official reports from the time discount this, indicating that Thomas actually killed him. By late that year, people around Pawnee had started complaining that the Dunn brothers were involved in rustling and robbery. Sheriff Frank Canton - a gunman with a substantial reputation who had previously arrested Bill Dunn for rustling - began investigating the claims.
On November 6, 1896, Bill Dunn rode into Pawnee intent on killing Sheriff Canton. As Canton walked out of a restaurant after having dinner, Bill Dunn fired two shots at him with a revolver, missing with both. Canton drew and quickly fired two shots, killing Dunn. The shooting was ruled self defense. Bill Dunn's death effectively ended the bounty hunting for the Dunn brothers, as their already questionable reputations suffered greatly.

 Pittocaulon is a genus of the tribe Senecioneae and the family Asteraceae.  Most if not all of its members used to be Senecio.
The five species of this genus have been described as "strange shrubs and small trees with broomstick-like branches".  All five species are native to the dry parts of central and southern Mexico. In addition to the strange appearance of these plants, Pittocaulon is of interest due to the remarkable range of habitats in which the species occur, from dry highland scrub well above 3000 meters, to tropical dry forest in hot country as low as 300 meters and on rocks, often in very steep situations.  Pittocaulon species are conspicuous (crazy) when they flower at the end of the dry season  are popularly called "palo loco" or "crazy tree", because they flower at the very end of the dry season when most other plants are suffering the effects of drought.

[[Feature-oriented programming]]
CATEGORIES: Programming paradigms

Feature Oriented Programming (FOP) or Feature Oriented Software Development (FOSD) is a general paradigm for program synthesis in software product lines.
FOSD arose out of layer-based designs and levels of abstraction in network protocols and extensible database systems in the late-1980s.[tpl]cite web | title=Design and Implementation of Hierarchical Software Systems with Reusable Components  | url=ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/predator/tosem-92.pdf[/tpl]  A program was a stack of layers. Each layer added functionality to previously composed layers and different compositions of layers produced different programs.   Not surprisingly, there was a need for a compact language to express such designs.  Elementary algebra fit the bill: each layer was function (program transformation) that added new code to an existing program to produce a new program, and a program's design was modeled by an expression, i.e., a composition of transformations (layers).  The figure below illustrates the stacking of layers h, j, and i (where h is on the bottom and i is on the top). The algebraic notations i(j(h))and i•j•h express these designs.
Over time, the idea of layers was generalized to features, where a feature is an increment in program development or functionality.   The paradigm for program design and synthesis was recognized to be a generalization of relational query optimization, where query evaluation programs were defined as relational algebra expressions, and query optimization was expression evaluation.[tpl]cite web | title=Access Path Selection In Relational Databases | url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582099[/tpl] A software product line (SPL) is a family of programs where each program is defined by a unique composition of features, and no two programs have the same combination. FOSD has since evolved into the study of feature modularity, tools, analyses, and design techniques to support feature-based program synthesis.
Further advances in FOSD arose from recognizing the following facts: Every program has multiple representations (e.g., source, makefiles,
documentation, etc.) and adding a feature to a program should elaborate each of its representations so that all representations are consistent.  Additionally, some of these representations could be generated (or derived) from other representations. In this article, the mathematics of the three most recent generations of FOSD, namely GenVoca, AHEAD,[tpl]cite web | title=Scaling Step-Wise Refinement | url=ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/predator/TSE-AHEAD.pdf[/tpl] and FOMDD are 
described, and links to product lines that have been developed using FOSD tools are provided.
Also, four additional results that apply to all generations of FOSD are presented elsewhere: MetaModels, Program Cubes, Feature Algebras, and Feature Interactions.

The Springfield metropolitan area is a region that is socio-economically and culturally tied to the City of Springfield, Massachusetts. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines the Springfield, MA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as consisting of three counties in Western Massachusetts. As of July 1, 2009, the metropolitan area's population was estimated at 698,903.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2009/CBSA-EST2009-01.csv | title = Table 1. Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009 (CBSA-EST2009-01) | format = CSV | work = 2009 Population Estimates | publisher = United States Census Bureau, Population Division | date = 2010-03-23 | accessdate = 2010-03-29[/tpl] Following the 2010 Census, there have been discussions about combining the metropolitan areas of Springfield, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, due to the region's economic interdependence and close geographic proximity (23.9 miles separate the cities' downtowns). 
An alternative system of measuring New England metropolitan areas has developed - called the NECTA - because, in New England, major cities and surrounding towns are often much smaller in land area than in other parts of the United States.  For example, the City of Springfield is 33.2 sq. miles, whereas the City of Fort Worth, Texas is 298.9 sq. miles, nearly 10 times larger in land area than Springfield. Because of the huge discrepancy in land area, in general New England cities like Springfield feature much higher population densities.  In addition, New England cities and towns have developed allegiances that transcend state borders; thus, cities in Connecticut are included in Springfield's NECTA. This system is thought to better approximate New England's metropolitan areas because it uses New England's geographically smaller building blocks. In Springfield's case, its NECTA consists of 51 additional cities/and towns surrounding the city.

Spinkai is a town in South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan. This semi-autonomous area is inhabited by Pashtun tribe Mahsud. In January 2008, Pakistan Army launched Operation Zalzala to flush out the Taliban militants belonging to Baitullah Mehsud grouphttp://www.dawn.com/2008/05/19/top3.htm
On 20 May 2008, the Pakistani Army conducted collective punishment against Spinkai. The operation was called 'zalzala' which is Urdu for earthquake. At first, the Pakistan Army swept through with helicopter gunships, artillery and tanks that crunched across a parched riverbed. After four days of heavy fighting, 25 militants and six soldiers died. The rest of the militants retreated up the valley. After the capture of the village the army discovered bomb factories, detonation-ready suicide jackets and schools for teenage suicide bombers.
The Pakistan Army immediately decided to punish the village for harboring the Taliban and allowing the militants to operate in and from the village to conduct further terror attacks in Pakistan. Bulldozers and explosives experts turned Spinkai's bazaar into a mile-long pile of rubble.[ref]

[[House of the Cascade]]
CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Tunisia

The House of the Cascade at Utica is typical of most of the Roman houses excavated to date in North Africa in that it looks inwards to a central courtyard around which the majority of the rooms are arranged. Two smaller courtyard gardens in the western part of the house provided additional light and air.
In other respects the house presents some unique aspects. It is one of the earliest town houses from the Roman period hitherto excavated in North Africa. Likewise the figurative mosaic with the fish mosaic in the cascade pool (itself unique) predates others with similar motifs in North Africa by at least a century. Finally, the ‘skewed’ articulation of the pavement in the large triclinium (apparently designed to maximise the view to the central courtyard and garden for the most important dinner guest), seems to be a unique feature.
The excavations performed of the house gives us valuable insight into the development of urbanisation at Utica as well as the domestic architecture and evolution of mosaics in Roman Tunisia. Although the majority of the pavements at the house lack the vivid colours and imaginative designs of the mosaics exhibited, for example, at the Bardo Museum in Tunis, this is made up for by their unusual variety and overall good state of preservation.
There are several themes running through the design of the house and its embellishment. One is the importance of the internal view (since the house lies in the centre of the town there would be little or no external view). From the main entrance in the north the passer-by would get a glimpse of a decorative pool (possibly adorned with a fountain and sculpture) located directly inside the vestibule. Other views were available to those chosen few who were allowed to pass through the corridor and into the central courtyard with its garden and decorative fountain. The architect who designed the main triclinium used framing columns and other devices so as to maximise the impact of the view of the central fountain and thus increase the enjoyment of the owner and his guests while they dined. Also the second main reception room (oecus) had a commanding view of the garden and pool.
The second theme governing the architecture and decoration is the allusion to public buildings. Columns, associated with temples and theatres, are used to support the portico round the central garden and in the smaller internal courtyards. There is some evidence that marble revetment, another reference to public spaces, was used to clothe the walls of the reception rooms. Although there is uncertainty in the positioning of the sculptures found at the House of the Cascade, these also allude to public spaces. They seem to have been selected with a view to self-aggrandisement, emphasising the fact that the owner was ‘a man of the world’, well versed in what was the latest fashion in the garden of a man of standing.
Living water, as used in fountains and pools, also plays an important role in the decoration of the house. The refreshing sight and sound of the splashing fountains and cascades and the luxuriant gardens must have provided a welcome relief from the heat of the Tunisian summer.
The aquatic element is also important in the thematic content of the figurative mosaics with imagery drawn from scenes of fishing and sea creatures. While depictions of fish were common in the iconography of the early Church and appear in the mosaics of basilica from the 5th and 6th centuries, it is likely that their choice at the House of the Cascade had a more prosaic reason. I contend that the designs were selected with a view to propitiating the Gods and in the hope of bringing bountiful catches as well as for their decorative appeal.
The architecture and decoration of the house allow its articulation into areas open to the public, reserved for distinguished guests, or open only to the owner and his immediate family. Utilitarian pavement in opus figlinum, simple opus tessellatum or opus lithostroton were utilised for service areas or corridors. More private rooms were generally paved with black and white geometric mosaics with a limited amount of polychromy. The most expensive pavements are those in opus sectile and polychrome figurative opus tessellatum, used in reception rooms and decorative fountain pools respectively.
It is unknown whether the owner received clients for dispensation of gifts and to receive their salutations. If so, then the large corridor just inside the vestibule, adorned with a fountain pool, could have been the site for such a ceremony. The small rooms adjoining the courtyard would have been suitable for the storage of gifts. This zone thus replaces the atrium of contemporary houses on the mainland. The privacy of the peristyle area would not be disturbed - along with the large reception rooms this area was then reserved for the more important guests. However, the house also included private areas reserved for the owner and his family, a shop as well as rented accommodation and servants' quarters. In this ability to combine a multitude of different functions in a relatively small house, the Roman architect responsible for houses like the House of the Cascade showed an imagination and degree of practicality not exceeded even by the sumptuous houses of the Renaissance or indeed of the present day.
Lacking written evidence we can only guess at the identity of the various owners of the house during the 400 years or so of Roman occupation. The size of the house and its architecture tell us that the owners were men of a certain status. Based on the similarity of its design and decoration to other Roman houses both on the mainland and elsewhere in North Africa we can surmise that the owner was well-travelled. Moreover, the references to the sea in the figurative mosaics suggest that the owner was possibly connected with the fish trade, for examples a fish exporter. Probably during the latter part of the period the house was occupied by a public official who received supplicants in the reception room (oecus) with its raised dais. Christianity had spread to Utica in the 3rd century and there is some speculative evidence that the owner was a church dignitary. Whether he combined this role with commercial ventures is not known.

National Sovereignty Party of Russia (Russian: Национально-державная партия России) is a Russian nationalist party established in 2002.
The declared ideology of the party is "Russian nationalism". Co-Chairmen of the party are Alexander Sevastyanov and Stanislav Terekhov.
It is affiliated with the Russian National Movement, and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration (DPNI), Russian National Union (RONS) and other nationalist organizations.
In 2003, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation issued a formal warning to the party of the inadmissibility of the implementation of extremist activities. In May 2003 the NDPR was excluded from the unified state register of political parties as it failed to meet the legal requirement of fielding 45 registered regional offices (as the NDPR had only 40 at the time).
In 2002, the World Congress of Russian Jewry, published in the newspaper The Jewish Word, accused the party of "inciting hatred of the peoples living in Russia, primarily the Jews". In response, representatives of the party filed a lawsuit for libel and demanded to recover from Berel Lazar 1.3 million rubles  In 2004 the court ordered Berel Lazar to apologize and pay damages of 100 rubles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

The phrase was proposed by Ellen 't Hoen of MSF, during the 61st World Health Assembly meeting in Geneva, in response to controversies over the use of the term "counterfeiting" in draft WHA resolutions, to describe activities that often involved health risks from unsafe, substandard or fake medicines.  The use of the term counterfeit was problematic and inaccurate to describe all of these activities, and health experts were seeking a new term to collectively describe these harmful activities.

[[Communium Interpretes]]
CATEGORIES: Pope Pius XII encyclicals

Communium Interpretes is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII at the ending of World War II  in Europe, appealing for prayers for peace during May, Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, Sunday, the 15 of April, 1945, in the seventh year of his  pontificate.
The encyclical states that the Pontiff, as interpreter of the universal anguish by which almost every nation is grievously distressed,  desires to leave nothing undone to  mitigate the numberless miseries and hasten the end of the great destruction. Men are unable to heal these great injuries. The human mind, blinded by  hate and rivalry, cannot easily determine a just and equitable solution of affairs along with a fraternal agreement. Divine and human rights demand unequivocally that  hideous slaughter cease as soon as possible. Communium Interpretes 1
The month of May of every year is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mother of God. The Pontiff asks all, especially the children, to pray  through the intercession of Mary, that the peoples  in discord, contention, and all kinds of misery, may be able to breathe again after their long-lasting distress and sorrow. Because of  sins, men have turned away from God  and created  destruction.
It will not be easy to achieve peace in the middle of such great destruction. Many are still angry and hateful.  Peace must be tempered by the impartial scale of justice, which embraces in fraternal charity all peoples and all nations and which does not bear hidden germs of discord and strife. Therefore, those who must come to agreement in this most grave cause, and those on whose recommendations not only the fate of their nations depends, but also the relationships of all mankind and the future course of the ages, especially need celestial help. Communium Interpretes 5
The Pope reminds of the many refugees, who are fugitives banished from their homeland and longing to once again see their own homes; for prisoners, and for those who lie in numberless hospitals. For these and for all others afflicted by this  conflict he asks for prayers to  the most merciful Mother of God. Communium Interpretes 7

[[After Hours (Little River Band album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1976 albums, Little River Band albums, Capitol Records albums

In Australia, After Hours was the second album from the Australian rock band Little River Band. It was released in 1976 by EMI. The first single from the album, "Everyday of My Life", was a top-ten hit in Australia.LRB Timeline
Lead singer Glenn Shorrock names this Australian version of the album as his favourite album by the band.Little River Band Discography However, it was not released internationally until decades later. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, the band's record company contract at the time did not cover international releases. Secondly, at the time of its release in Australia, the band's first album, Little River Band, had not yet become a hit in the US. When the first album  entered the US charts, following the delayed success of single "It's a Long Way There", any potential US release of After Hours was delayed.
In the meantime, the band recorded their third album, Diamantina Cocktail. However, Capitol Records in the US deemed that album to be not commercial enough. In response, Capitol selected five tracks from the Australian After Hours plus four tracks from the Australian version of Diamantina Cocktail and released this compilation in the US under the name Diamantina Cocktail. On that album, the tracks from After Hours were released in different mixes than on the original album, "Days on the Road" was partly re-recorded and "Take Me Home" was completely re-recorded with the new lineup. Subsequently the remaining tracks from both Australian albums were compiled and released (in 1980) on another album, titled After Hours. Thus, all tracks from the two original Australian albums were eventually released in the US (remixed and re-recorded, to some extent), on albums of the same names as the Australian albums, but in a scrambled form across the two albums.Little River Band Discography The AllMusic rating for After Hours is for the version that is a compilation of leftovers from the Australian albums following the international release of Diamantina Cocktail.http://www.allmusic.com/album/after-hours-mw0000089169
The album, in its international form, was re-released with bonus tracks in 1997 by One Way Records.Allmusic On 30 July 2010, the original Australian version of After Hours became available for the first time in the US, as a download (in digitally remastered form) at the iTunes Store.
In between the recording of After Hours and Diamantina Cocktail, two founding members of the band departed: Ric Formosa (lead guitar) and Roger McLachlan (bass).

[tpl]wiktionary|Appendix:Names derived from Miryam[/tpl]
Mary is a feminine given name, the English form of the name Maria, which was in turn a Latin form of the Greek names  Μαριαμ, or Mariam, and Μαρια, or Maria, found in the New Testament. Both New Testament names were forms of the Hebrew name  מִרְיָם or Miryam.Behind the Name
The usual meaning given by various sources for the name is the Hebrew מרר m-r-r meaning "bitterness" (cf. myrrh). Other meanings suggested include "rebelliousness" (מרי m-r-y), or "wished for child" or "Our Lady" (ש"ע מריה Sha Mrih) or "beloved lady", referring to the Christian reverence for the Virgin Mary. The Web site  Behind the Name notes that the name could also be a name of Egyptian origin, perhaps from the word elements mry, meaning "beloved" or mr, meaning "love".

Ralf-Henrik ”Dave” Lindholm (born 31 March 1952, Helsinki) is a Finnish guitarist and singer-songwriter who has made a career under his own name and also participated in some noteworthy groups.Dave Lindholm 1979, YLE interview [tpl]sv icon[/tpl] He has written songs and recorded in both Finnish and English.
Lindholm's first recordings were made with his band Ferris that published its sole recording in 1971 through the Love Records label. He wanted to record for Love Records also as a solo artist and suggested that "Great Pen Lee" would be his new stage name. Ther record label however persuaded him to use the name "Isokynä" (trans. "big pen") and to sing in Finnish or Swedish instead of English. Thus he recorded two albums in Finnish in years 1972 and 1973. Especially the second LP Sirkus, is considered to be one of the most important Finnish rock albums.
In 1975 he established a group that performed in English. He named the group simply the Rock 'n' Roll Band. The band only released one album. In 1978 he released a very successful solo album Vanha ja Uusi Romanssi. He had dropped the name "Isokynä" and was now called simply Dave (pronounced Dá-vé in Finnish slang) Lindholm. In 1979 he formed a rock group called the Bluesounds that also performed in English.  Its most famous album "Black" was released in 1980.
Lindholm has kept on recording and performing his music throughout the years. He has enjoyed relatively little publicity compared to many other long term rock musicians in Finland, but his works are highly respected by Finnish popular music critics and rock/pop music lovers. The most famous songs by Lindholm include "Pieni ja hento ote" (a small slender grip, "Jatsikansa tulee" (the jazz folks are coming), "Sitähän se kaikki on" (that's what it all is), "Kaikki menee seinään" (everything runs into the wall), "Joo, joo, mä rakastan sua" (yes, yes I love you), ja "Annan kitaran laulaa vaan" (just let the guitar sing).

Papaver bracteatum, also known as the Iranian poppy and Persian Poppy is a sturdy hardy perennial poppy with large deep red flowers up to 8 inches (20 cm) diameter on stiff stalks up to 4 feet (1.22 metres) high with a prominent black spot near the base of the petals. It is related to the commonly cultivated oriental poppy, Papaver orientale.
Non-horticultural use of this species is for the production of thebaine, which is commercially converted to codeine and semi-synthetic opiates. Papaver bracteatum does not contain morphine, codeine or any other narcotic alkaloids in significant amounts. Oripavine was reported in minute traces but would not exert a relevant activity.Von Lyle E. Craker, James E. Simon (Eds.) (1991). Herbs, Spices, and Medicinal Plants: Recent Advances in Botany, Horticulture, and Pharmacology Vol. II. (p. 69) Binghamton NY: The Haworth Press Inc. LCCN 86-646860
United States domestic cultivation of P. bracteatum was proposed by president Richard Nixon's Office of Management and Budget in the early 1970s as an alternative to Turkish opium poppies, which the administration was attempting to eliminate. This was because P. bracteatum does not contain morphine, which is converted to heroin, but is high in thebaine for legal codeine production, which was in crisis at the time because of the dwindling Turkish supply. However, US government scientists feared Bentley compounds,BENTLEY, K. W. & HARDY, D. G. (1967) Novel analgesics and molecular rearrangements in the morphine-thebaine group. III.

[[Social network change detection]]
CATEGORIES: Social networks, Social statistics

Social network change detection (SNCD)| is a process of monitoring social networks to determine when significant changes to their organizational structure occur and what caused them.  This scientific approach combines analytical techniques from social network analysis with those from statistical process control.  SNCD can be used to detect when significant changes occur in a network.  In application, it requires the use of statistical process control charts to detect changes in observable network measures. By taking measures of a network over time, a control chart can be used to signal when significant changes occur in the network.  
This approach has been demonstrated to be effective on several real world data sets.  A social network was created for a group of 24 Army officers going through a 1 year graduate program at Columbia University (McCulloh, et al., 2007).  SNCD was able to detect the group's comprehensive exam and identified the most likely time of change to be the week that study questions were sent to the group.  An open source social network of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization was monitored using SNCD, and it signaled a change in the organization prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center (McCulloh, et al., 2007).  SNCD has also been demonstrated to be effective on simulated data.
SNCD was initially proposed by Major Ian McCulloh, an assistant professor in the U.S. Military Academy's Network Science Center in 2006.  Since then, SNCD has been presented at a variety of venues from NetSci2007 in New York City to the International Network for Social Network Analysis annual conference in 2008, to the Military Operations Research Society Working Group on emerging threats and social networks in 2008.

Her research primarily focuses on the functional anatomy of extinct vertebrates, especially dinosaurs, using computational methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). In the landmark paper Rayfield et al. (2001),Rayfield, E. J., Norman, D. B., Horner, C. C., Horner, J. R., Smith, P. M., Thomason, J. J. and Upchurch, P. 2001.

[[Jack Fallon]]
CATEGORIES: 1915 births, 2006 deaths, British jazz double-bassists

Jack Fallon (October 13, 1915, London, Ontario - May 22, 2006, London, England) was a British jazz bassist born in Canada.
Fallon played violin before making double-bass his primary instrument at age 20. During World War II he played in a dance band in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and settled in Britain after his discharge. He joined the band of Ted Heath in 1946, and played bebop in London clubs in his spare time. In 1947 he played with Ronnie Scott and Tommy Whittle at the Melody Maker/Columbia Jazz Rally, and following this worked with Jack Jackson (1947), George Shearing (1948) and Django Reinhardt (1949). Soon after playing with Reinhardt, he played in a Count Basie ensemble which also included Malcolm Mitchell and Tony Crombie; he played with both of them after leaving Basie, working together with Hoagy Carmichael and Maxine Sullivan and touring in Sweden together with Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli.
Fallon worked in the 1950s as an accompanist to Mary Lou Williams, Sarah Vaughan, and Lena Horne, and also served as a sideman in the ensembles of Humphrey Lyttelton, Kenny Baker, and Ralph Sharon. Additionally, he was house bassist at Lansdowne Studios. He worked outside of jazz with blues musicians such as Big Bill Broonzy and Josh White, and played with Johnny Duncan's Blue Grass Boys. As the bass guitar became more popular, Fallon became a champion of its use, and played both instruments in the latter part of his career.
Fallon was also involved in the industry as a booker/promoter, having established the booking agency Cana Variety in 1952. Cana booked primarily jazz artists in its early stages but expanded to rock acts in the 1960s, including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Because of this connection, Fallon was asked by the Beatles to play fiddle on the song "Don't Pass Me By" (from  The Beatles).
Fallon continued to play jazz locally in London and in the studios into the 1990s. He published a memoir entitled From the Top in 2005, and died the following year at age 90.

[[1989–90 Manchester United F.C. season]]
CATEGORIES: Manchester United F.C. seasons, English football clubs 1989–90 season

The 1989–90 season was Manchester United's 87th season in the Football League, and their 15th consecutive season in the top division of English football.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season1990.html |title=Manchester United Season 1989/90 |accessdate=23 May 2008 |publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk [/tpl]
The season brought their lowest league finish since their relegation from the First Division 15 years earlier, as they finished 13th in the league, and by Christmas there were continued calls from fans for Alex Ferguson to be sacked as manager. However, the season ended on a high as United won the FA Cup by beating Crystal Palace 1–0 in a replay after drawing the first game 3–3. It was their first major trophy for five years, and their first since the appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager.
It also saw them enter European competition as England's representatives in the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup following the end of the ban on English clubs in European competition arising from the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985.
1989–90 saw Mark Hughes top the club's goalscoring charts for the second year running, while the club welcomed four new major signings in the early part of the season – Danny Wallace, Neil Webb, Paul Ince and Gary Pallister.
This season also saw the attempted purchase of the club by businessman Michael Knighton after chairman Martin Edwards considered selling the club for a reported £10 million. The sale fell through after Knighton was found to not have the money required to maintain the club. This period is best remembered for Knighton – wearing a United kit and tracksuit top – performing a keepie uppie routine before a United game with Arsenal. According to Alex Ferguson in his autobiography; Managing My Life (published nearly a decade later), this display of showboating annoyed Ferguson as he felt it was detrimental to his teams' preparation for the forthcoming match – although United did go on to win the game. He also revealed in the autobiography that in spite of the club's dismal form during the first half of the season, he was assured by the club's directors that his position as manager was never at risk; although naturally disappointed with the club's lack of progress in the league, they understood the reason for this - namely that a number of key players, including Neil Webb, were unavailable for long spells due to injury. However, Ferguson also admitted in his autobiography that had he not achieved success with United that season, he feared that the pressure on the club's board to sack him could soon have become irresistible. There had been numerous calls from fans during the season for Ferguson to be sacked, and media reports had suggested that the former Everton manager Howard Kendall would be appointed as his successor. Ironically, Kendall was appointed by United's local rivals Manchester City during the season.

The 1990–91 season was Manchester United's 88th season in the Football League, and their 16th consecutive season in the top division of English football.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/seasons/season1991.html |title=Manchester United Season 1990/91 |accessdate=23 May 2008 |publisher=StretfordEnd.co.uk [/tpl]
After winning the FA Cup the previous year to end a five-year trophy drought and claim their first major trophy under the management of Alex Ferguson, United went on to achieve more success by lifting the European Cup Winners' Cup – their first major trophy since their European Cup triumph 23 years earlier – by beating Barcelona 2–1 in Rotterdam, with Mark Hughes scoring both goals. It was the first season back in European competitions for English clubs following the lifting of the ban which had been imposed back in 1985 due to the Heysel Stadium disaster.
Hughes was voted PFA Player of the Year, while promising young winger Lee Sharpe was voted PFA Young Player of the Year. Fellow winger Ryan Giggs, aged 17 and said to be the club's finest young prospect since George Best, signed a professional contract in late November, and soon broke into the first team, making two league appearances and scoring one goal. A new arrival at the club was full-back Denis Irwin, signed from Oldham Athletic for a fee of £625,000 in the close season. Following his impressive performance in the previous season's FA Cup final replay, Les Sealey's loan move became permanent on a one-year contract, and he surprisingly left at the end of the season despite being the club's first choice goalkeeper for the season. 
United also reached the League Cup final for the second time, but suffered a shock defeat to Sheffield Wednesday (managed by former United boss Ron Atkinson). In the league, United improved upon the previous season's 13th place finish, but erratic form meant they finished sixth and were below neighbours Manchester City for the first time in more than a decade. Their defence of the FA Cup ended in the Fifth Round when they lost 2–1 to Norwich City.
Assistant manager Archie Knox resigned late in the campaign to take the same role at Rangers, and was replaced by Brian Kidd.

The season saw United lift the League Cup for the first time in their history with a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Wembley Stadium, but they then endured the disappointment of being beaten to the league title by rivals Leeds United, having led the league for much of the season.
New signings for the season included Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and England right-back Paul Parker. Ryan Giggs, who had played twice for United in 1990–91, broke into the first team and was one of the most exciting players in the country as he won the PFA Young Player of the Year award. 
Soviet international winger Andrei Kanchelskis, who had joined United in the later stages of the 1990–91 season, was also putting in star performances to give manager Alex Ferguson a more attacking alternative to the ageing Mike Phelan on the right hand side of midfield.

[[Master of the Saint Lambrecht Votive Altarpiece]]

CATEGORIES: 15th-century births, 15th-century Austrian painters, Anonymous artists, Year of death unknown

The Master of the Saint Lambrecht Votive Altarpiece was an Austrian painter active between about 1410 and 1440.  His name is derived from a panel, formerly in St. Lambrecht's Abbey in the village of Sankt Lambrecht in Styria.  This, now in the Alte Galerie in Graz, depicts a former abbot of the monastery, Heinrich Moyker, kneeling before the Virgin of Mercy; with him is Hemma of Gurk.  Moyker was the donor of the altarpiece, which depicts the Hungarian victory over the Ottoman Turks.  A number of other paintings are believed to be by his hand, as is the design of a stained glass window in Sankt Lambrecht; some of these have also been ascribed to the so-called Master of the Linz Crucifixion, while others are believed to be by Hans von Judenburg or Hans von Tübingen.  The latter appears to have lived too late to be identified with the Master's oeuvre.  Stylistically, the Master's ascribed body of work indicates a familiarity with International Gothic as practiced in Bohemia.  Other stylistic traits suggest knowledge of the work being done in Cologne and Westphalia, while still others show aspects of the Viennese, French, and Burgundian schools.

[[Jack Minnis]]
CATEGORIES: Year of birth missing, 2001 deaths, Civil rights activists

Jack Minnis ( d. 2005) was an American activist, and the founder and director of opposition research for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the Civil Rights era. Minnis researched federal expenditures and state and local subversion of racial equality.  Minnis was white, but remained affiliated with SNCC even after it adopted a "whites only" personnel policy, its only white employee for a long time.  He helped to train such workers as Stokely Carmichael, Marion Barry, and John Lewis. 
Minnis had been hired by the Southern Regional Council  to evaluate their Voter Education Project, which included voter registration efforts in the South in 1962. Minnis was fired for what he later said were justifiable political reasons, and suggested that SNCC start its own research unit to aid its activist effort. Jack Minnis ran SNCC's research department out of the Atlanta office, but traveled widely in the South to assist local efforts to register voters.  By 1965, Minnis was producing a weekly mimeographed opposition research-based newsletter, Life in the Great Society with Lyndon, which made public some of the activities of President Lyndon B. Johnson that were not covered by the mainstream media.  These weekly reports played a significant role in the radicalization of SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and CORE field staff.Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement, http://www.crmvet.org/mem/forman.htm#formminnis, retrieved May 23, 2008. 
Minnis watched closely the movement of federal money toward corporate interests; he remarked on such various incidents as Johnson's appointment of a Merck policymaker to a board that would determine Merck's culpability for false claims with its Sucrets coughdrop product, and an Agency for International Development project that was possibly a front for CIA activity.[ref]Jack Minnis, Life in the Great Society With Lyndon, Vol. 1, No. 1, n.p. 
[/ref] 
Once the Civil Rights Act became law in 1964, Minnis monitored its enforcement and found the Johnson administration's work to be "shoddy" in desegregating schools and hospitals. He also pointed out that there were still laws on the books in many states that prevented black from being jurors. Simon Hall, Peace and Freedom: The Civil Rights Movement and the Antiwar Movement, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006, p. 20. Minnis kept a substantial file on the activities of the White Citizens Council in the "black belt" states in the South, and conducted research in standard reference works such as Moody's Manuals, Standard and Poor's Registry, and census data to link prominent white citizens in the South to white violence and anti-labor activities. He organized his files for quick access, and made information available to groups sympathetic to SNCC's objectives. Minnis discovered a little-known loophole in Alabama law that enabled blacks in Lowndes County to form an independent party and run for office without navigating the traditional local two-party systems.James Forman, The Making of Black Revolutionaries, University of Washington Press, 1997, p. 443. His activities and writings  were monitored by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state-run segregationist surveillance unit directed by the governor that enlisted and paid ordinary citizens to report "suspicious" activity.  Minnis's movements in the South were tracked with the aid of state police in several states who telexed his license plate numbers to law enforcement in towns where Minnis conducted workshops on how to register to vote, how to run for office, and other normal citizenship activities. The Sovereignty Commission's files on Minnis contain 88 items. "Jack Minnis" file, Mississippi Department of Archives and History, http://www.mdah.state.ms.us/arlib/contents/er/sovcom/imagelisting.php 
Minnis was 
Minnis had a profound influence on journalists of the Civil Rights movement, and journalists who later documented the movement.  Judy Richardson, who produced the documentary Eyes on the Prize said, "Whenever I speak on campuses about SNCC, I talk about Minnis...about SNCC's research department and Jack:  He was this crusty older white guy who smoked like a fiend, looked generally unkempt, and could get research from a turnip. He was always finding information --like buried treasure --that would make all the difference... the way Minnis organized material had affected me.. . Minnis's chronology was invaluable in helping northern journalists understand the extent of what we were dealing with."quoted in Jay Taber, "Continuity"

[[Pesticide formulation]]
CATEGORIES: Pesticides, Public health

The biological activity of a pesticide, be it chemical or biological in nature, is determined by its active ingredient (AI - also called the active substance). Pesticide products very rarely consist of pure technical material. The AI is usually formulated with other materials and this is the product as sold, but it may be further diluted in use. Formulation improves the properties of a chemical for handling, storage, application and may substantially influence effectiveness and safety.Knowles, DA (1998) Chemistry and technology of agricultural formulations. Kluwer Academic, London
Formulation terminology follows a 2-letter convention: (e.g. GR: granules) listed by CropLife International (formerly GIFAP then GCPF) in the Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types (Monograph 2); see: download page. Some manufacturers do not follow these industry standards, which can cause confusion for users.

Norberto Höfling (20 June 1924 – 18 April 2005) was a Jewish Romanian footballer and coach.
Höfling began his career as professional footballer in Romania, being at his peak between 1945 and 1947 when he played for the national team of Romania and also for Carmen Bucureşti, one of the best teams of that period of time.
He left the country in 1948 to play for MTK Budapest and then he followed the route: Lazio Roma, Pro Patria Calcio, ending his career at Vicenza Calcio.
At the age of 33, in 1957, Höfling started his career as football manager at Club Brugge. He left the club after six years, due to a dispute with Fernand Goyvaerts, then the star player of Club Brugge, to coach the Dutch team Feyenoord.[tpl]cite news |url=http://kranten.delpher.nl/nl/view/index?query=Hofling&coll=ddd&image=ddd%3A011233292%3Ampeg21%3Aa0026&page=1&maxperpage=10|work=De Tijd |language= Dutch|date=1963-06-19 |accessdate= 2010-07-21|title=Roemeen Höfling nieuwe trainer van Feijenoord[/tpl]
Being sacked from Feyenoord after only one year, Höfling returned to Belgium after he signed with R.W.D. Molenbeek, helping the team to win promotion into Belgian First Division.
In 1967 he rejoined Club Brugge. His second spell at the club was more successful than the first one, winning the Belgian Cup, before being signed by Anderlecht Brussels, only to be sacked after few months due to poor results.
A second spell at R.W.D. Molenbeek followed, but this time it was for a short period of time only, as he did not manage to win promotion in the top league, as he did with few years earlier when the team was called Racing White.
In 1972 he signed with A.S. Oostende and in only two years he promoted the club from the third division to the top league. Again problems arose between him and the administration and the players that led to his retirement in 1976.
He then went to work at K.A.A. Gent before retiring in 1978.
He was 80 years of age when he died in Brugges.

Hans von Judenburg was an Austrian painter and sculptor active between 1411 and 1424.  Very little is known of his life; in 1411, and again in 1424, he was listed as a householder in Judenburg.  He ran an artists' studio there as well; it was devoted primarily to the creation of altarpieces.  He is known to have created a retable for the high altar of the parish church of Bolzano (then Bozen), contracted in 1421 and finished three years later.  Most of its fragments, now dispersed, survive.  The center panel depicted the Coronation of the Virgin, along with John the Baptist and Vergilius of Salzburg.  Various scenes from the Life of the Virgin were shown on the wings; these are now scattered around various locations, including the parish church of Deutschnofen.  The hand of at least two different carvers can be seen in the work.  
Michael Pacher, for his altarpiece in Gries-San Quirino, is known to have taken Hans's work as model, as he was contractually obligated so to do.

Grover S. Resinger (October 20, 1915 — January 11, 1986) was an American coach in Major League Baseball during the 1960s and 1970s. Previously, he was a minor league third baseman and manager. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, the 5'9" (175 cm), 160-pound (73 kg) Resinger batted and threw right-handed.
As a player, Resinger peaked at the Class A1 level (equivalent to Class AA today) with the Little Rock Travelers (1941 and 1946) of the Southern Association. He began his managerial career in 1947 as skipper (and third baseman) of the Pensacola, Florida, Flyers of the Class B Southeastern League, but he was released as manager on June 14 with a 28-31 record. He remained in the league, but strictly as a third baseman, with the Meridian, Mississippi, Peps through 1949. During his 11-year minor league playing career, Resinger batted over .300 six times.
After spending the 1950s out of organized baseball, Resinger returned to the game in 1960 as a coach with the Houston Buffaloes of the AAA American Association. He then joined the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1961 as a manager in their farm system. His 1962 Billings Mustangs won the Pioneer League championship. In 1963-64 he managed the Tulsa Oilers of the AA Texas League (winning the 1963 TL title) and in 1965 he was the pilot of the Jacksonville Suns of the AAA International League. His minor league managing record was 420 wins, 395 losses (.515).
At age 50, Resinger was promoted to his first major-league coaching assignment with the 1966 Atlanta Braves, although he resigned August 10 upon the firing of his boss, manager Bobby Bragan. But he returned to the majors in 1967 as the third-base coach of the Chicago White Sox (1967–1968) and Detroit Tigers (1969–1970). In his final MLB assignment, he was the bench coach for Dick Williams with the California Angels in 1975–1976.
Resinger was a colorful figure who promoted a fiery, hustling brand of play. In the waning days of his Detroit tenure, in September 1970, he bemoaned a listless performance on the field, saying: "You know, when country-club teams like the Red Sox and Tigers get together, they should play baseball one day, polo the next, golf the next, and sail boats the fourth day.""They Said It," Sports Illustrated, September 21, 1970
Resinger died in St. Louis at age 70.

Jon Ortner (Jonathan Ortner) (born 1951, Great Neck, Long Island, New York) is an American photographer known for his work in the Himalaya Mountains of Nepal, Bhutan, and Ladakh. He has photographed and written about southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Bali, Java, and India. He has most recently photographed in the deserts and canyons of the American West. These photos have been collected in Canyon Wilderness of the Southwest.
Ortner attended University of Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas, where he studied Photography, Eastern Philosophy, and Systematics and Ecology. At the age of 20 he made his first journey to India and Nepal where experiences in the Himalaya focused the direction of his photography. In 1978, Ortner moved to Manhattan with his wife Martha McGuire where they opened a commercial studio. His assignment photography has been used in advertising and promotion for corporations and real estate developers.
Ortner's photography in Asia has focused on the highest mountains and deepest gorges on earth, and the meditative philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism that evolved there. He has led expeditions throughout the Himalaya, some for as long as 65 days. Several of them have been documented in Buddah which has won an IPPY and a ForeWord Book Award. Its introduction was written by Jack Kornfield.
His books combine graphic photography with scholarly and informative text. The importance of pilgrimage, symbolic architecture, and the sacred topography of the Himalaya has been a recurrent theme in both his photography and writings.
Ortner's photographs have been shown at the Nikon, Kodak, and Neikrug Galleries in the United States. [tpl]TOC right[/tpl]

[[Marine spatial planning]]
CATEGORIES: Oceanography

Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean – including energy, industry, government, conservation and recreation – to make informed and coordinated decisions about how to use marine resources sustainably. MSP generally uses maps to create a more comprehensive picture of a marine area – identifying where and how an ocean area is being used and what natural resources and habitat exist. It is similar to land-use planning, but for marine waters. 
Through the planning and mapping process of a marine ecosystem, planners can consider the cumulative effect of maritime industries on our seas, seek to make industries more sustainable and proactively minimize conflicts between industries seeking to utilise the same sea area. The intended result of MSP is a more coordinated and sustainable approach to how our oceans are used – ensuring that marine resources and services are utilized, but within clear environmental limits to ensure marine ecosystems remain healthy and biodiversity is conserved.

The Saints' Roost Museum in Clarendon, Texas, United States, features heirlooms from Panhandle ranches, farms, and businesses as well as a renovated railroad depot and a collection of materials from the Red River War.Saints Roost Museum - Texas Travel The unusual name of the museum is derived from Clarendon having been established in 1878 as a prohibition community by a Methodist clergyman, L.H. Carhart. A "sobriety settlement" in contrast to typical boom towns of that era, Clarendon acquired the sobriquet "Saints Roost" from local cowboys.Texas Online: Clarendon, Texas
The Fort Worth and Denver Railway depot was moved to the Saints' Roost location in 1996 and fully restored. A kitchen area has been placed behind the ticket office. The original depot dates to 1887,  when the railroad reached both Clarendon, the seat of Donley County, and Amarillo some sixty miles to the west. The replica depot contains some of the materials used in the original building, which was improved twice in the early 20th century.The Saints' Roost Museum
Another focus of the museum, the Red River War was a military campaign launched by the United States Army in 1874 to remove various Indian tribes, including the Comanche under Chief Quanah Parker, from the Southern Great Plains and relocate them to reservations in the former Indian Territory (since Oklahoma).
The Saints’ Roost is housed in the former  Adair Hospital, founded in 1910, primarily for the use of local cowboys, by the matriarch of the nearby JA Ranch, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair. Mrs. Adair maintained a home in Clarendon when she desired to leave ranch headquarters. She was also the owner of Glenveagh Castle in County Donegal, Ireland, now an Irish national park, from 1885, on the death of her second husband, John George Adair, until her own passing in 1921.JA Ranch
The museum holds an annual fundraising benefit in September, the Charles Goodnight Chuckwagon Cookoff.The Saints' Roost Museum It has exhibits on Goodnight, a legendary Texas cattleman who invented the chuckwagon, and Harold Dow Bugbee, a Western artist, both of whom claimed Clarendon as their home.The Saints' Roost Museum The museum is located at 610 East Harrington Street just off Texas State Highway 70 South.

Mead, a corporation based out of Ohio,  owned Lexis-Nexis, which was based out of Illinois. Mead sold Lexis, and Illinois maintained that Mead must pay them a proportionate capital-gains tax. Illinois asserted that Mead and Lexis were integrated to the extent required for the "unitary business rule". This rule allowed states to tax a proportionate share of the value generated by an interstate corporation. 
The Supreme Court held that the two businesses were not integrated enough to be considered a "unitary business" and Illinois was not allowed to tax Mead on the Lexis sale.

[[A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower]]

CATEGORIES: Security

A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower is the United States' newest maritime strategy.A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower  It was presented by the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandants of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard at the International Seapower Symposium at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island on October 17, 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/17/AR2007101700536.html|title=New Maritime Strategy to Focus on 'Soft Power' |publisher=Washington Post |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |author=Ann Scott Tyson[/tpl]  The new maritime strategy explains the comprehensive role of the sea services in an era marked by globalization and uncertainty.
The development of a new strategy began in June 2006 at the direction of former Chief of Naval Operations and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen. The last maritime strategy was published at the height of the Cold War in 1986 and needed to be updated to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.  This was the first maritime strategy to be signed by the leaders of all three U.S. sea services, the Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard.
A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower is not infused with typical military-focused language.  The strategy makes a case for the value of seapower in preserving the American way of life by maintaining safe, global commerce operations across the seas.  It acknowledges that there is a global system of connected economies which depends on the freedom of movement across the maritime commons; the principal means for the transit of 90% of the world’s commerce by weight and volume.  With such a global interconnection of economies, shocks to the system caused by regional conflicts, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and war all have potential global impact.  The strategy states that U.S. vital interests are best served by having forward positioned maritime forces around the globe, postured in a way to prevent, deter, limit, and localize conflicts, wars, and disruptions to the global system that all rely upon. International from beginning to end, the strategy describes the necessity to forge global partnerships to establish a resilient peace.
During testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on December 13, 2007, General James T. Conway, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps said:
 
  The basic premise of our newly published maritime strategy is that the United States is a force for good in the world-that while we are capable of launching a clenched fist when we must- offering the hand of friendship is also an essential and prominent tool in our kit.  That premise flows from the belief that preventing wars is as important as winning wars.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/hasc/audio_transcripts.shtml Full Committee hearing on global maritime strategy initiatives]  General James T.

Alongside similar remains found in Cioclovina Cave (from ca. 29,000 BP), they are among the most ancient early modern humans in Romanian prehistory.
The human skull is that of a woman with obvious anatomically modern human traits, including a high forehead, small jaw and small supraorbital ridges. Despite the tall cranial vault, the occipital bone forms a distinct dome, a trait normally associated with Neanderthals. The largely intact facial bones indicate a woman with "rugged traits". This mosaic of features mirrors that seen in the Peștera cu Oase find, indicating possible Neanderthal admixture or generally robust (archaic) traits (or both).BBC Science news: Cave fossils are early Europeans, 30 October 2006 The early date makes the find referable to the early Cro-Magnon group of finds.
On the basis of radiocarbon dating and also the analysis of the archaeological context, some researchers advanced the hypothesis of the association of these bones with Cro-Magnons and the Aurignacian archaeological culture. Others mention the possibility that these findings could belong to a certain regional culture from the Southern Carpathians, from the period of the Final Middle Paleolithic and Early Upper Paleolithic.

The Pulau Pisang Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on the highest point of Pulau Pisang, an island in the Strait of Malacca 15 kilometres from Pontian Kechil, Johor, Malaysia.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.lighthousedepot.com/lite_explorer.asp?action=display_details&LighthouseID=3700&bhcd2=1211558512 | title = Pulau Pisang Lighthouse | publisher = Lighthouse Depot | accessdate = 2008-05-24[/tpl]
Built in 1914, the lighthouse was constructed as a white 16 metre (52 feet) high circular cast iron tower with one support structure and a single storey keeper's house at the base, remaining functional as an aid for maritime navigation into the western entrance of the Singapore Strait, as of 2008. Due to its isolated location, the lighthouse is only reachable via boat and an access road.
While located within the borders of Malaysia, the lighthouse is operated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the result of an agreement signed in 1900 whereby Sultan Ibrahim of Johor granted the British government of Singapore (part of the Straits Settlements), rights in perpetuity to the plot of land on which the lighthouse stands and to the roadway leading to it, so long as the Straits Settlements operated the lighthouse. The lighthouse's status has thus been contentious in recent years due to access of Singaporean workers to the lighthouse.

CATEGORIES: Landforms of Iran, Razavi Khorasan Province, World Digital Library related

Kalat-i-nadiri is a massive natural fortress located about 44 miles north of Sousia in the Kalat, Khorasan region of Iran.

It is essentially a massive plateau about 4 miles in circumference that has been used as a fortress since before the Achaemenid era.  It is surrounded on 3 sides by high cliff walls ranging from 1500 feet on the south side to 2000 feet on the west side with lower eastern walls and a gently sloping plain leading up to the heights from the north.
It is famous as the only fortress ever to withstand a siege by Tamerlane.
Alexander the Great's army laid siege to it.  While Alexander left to deal with a rebellious Persian chieftain, he ordered Craterus to command the majority of the army and take the fortress.

The Mount Holly Mausoleum was designed by architects Thompson and Harding in 1917 and is located in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Its architectural significance lies in its austerity of simple Greek Revival design.   The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  The mausoleum is located in the northwest corner of Little Rock's oldest and most picturesque cemetery, Mount Holly (which is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places).
Constructed of limestone, the building is composed of a central entrance block flanked by two smaller wings.  The entrance is framed by two fluted Doric columns which have been set back into the structure and are flush with the outside wall.  A simple cornice with cavetto molding wraps the entire central block; the simple parapet rises slightly higher over the entrance.  The entrance features two double doors with multi paned leaded glass cames (grooved strips that hold together the panes) embellished with a laurel wreath motif in stained glass. Additionally, stained glass windows with predominant tones of gold, green, and lavender appear flanking the door and in the transom as well as at the rear of the main block.[ref]

CATEGORIES: Religious organizations established in 1982, Unitarian Universalism in Canada, Unitarian Universalism in the United States, Unitarian Universalist organizations, Youth empowerment organizations, Youth religious organizations, Youth-led organizations

Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU) is a term used within the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) in the United States and the Canadian Unitarian Council. YRUU was an organization at the continental level primarily run by youth, ranging in age from 14 to 20, with mentoring adult partners. The continental organization of YRUU ended in 2008, but the term is still used by certain active youth groups and conferences at the congregational and regional/district levels.[tpl]R|uuindex[/tpl]
The continental YRUU goals included youth empowerment, social activism and building leadership qualities.[tpl]R|uuamin|erickson[/tpl] YRUU members often made their presence known in public demonstrations; for instance, in the June 23, 2006 protest in St. Louis, Missouri against Victoria's Secret for allegedly printing its catalogues on paper from endangered North American forests.[tpl]R|kmov[/tpl]
In February 2008, UUA President William G. Sinkford, in a letter to the YRUU Steering Committee, announced there would be no further funding for continental level YRUU at the end of the fiscal year. “There is broad consensus that the current structure for continental youth ministry is not serving our faith well,” wrote Sinkford. “It is true that continental YRUU, as we have known it, will be replaced at some point by a new structure that will serve us better.”[tpl]R|uutrans[/tpl] Two months later, the UUA Board of Trustees announced it would cease its funding for the continental level YRUU activities in June 2008 and refocus its North American youth ministry endeavors.[tpl]R|uuworldplans[/tpl] The Youth Ministry Working Group (YMWG)[tpl]R|workinggroup[/tpl] was appointed and charged with recommending a strategic imagination and framework for Unitarian Universalist youth ministry. The YMWG concluded in 2009 and issued a final set of recommendations of concrete actions that could bring forth a vision of vibrant, congregationally-based youth ministry and truly multigenerational faith communities.[tpl]R|workinggrouprec[/tpl]
Beginning in 1982, continental YRUU published the newspaper Synapse, which appeared three times a year.[tpl]R|erickson[/tpl]  In 2005, budget cuts forced the publication to be switched to two online issues that were compiled into a single print edition. In 2007, the UUA's Office of Youth Ministries halted publication, identifying a lack of submissions and staffing, and announced that Synapse would be replaced by a newsletter that would be published three times a year.[tpl]R|synapseletter[/tpl]  The UUA's Office of Youth and Young Adult Ministries now publishes a monthly e-newsletter distributed by email and an ongoing blog Blue Boat,[tpl]R|blueboat[/tpl] which is open to submissions about topics of interest to and/or written by UU youth, young adults, or their adult allies.[tpl]R|uuagetconnected[/tpl]

In reflection seismology, normal moveout (NMO) describes the effect that the distance between a seismic source and a receiver (the offset) has on the arrival time of a reflection in the form of an increase of time with offset.Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. NMO.  The relationship between arrival time and offset is hyperbolic and it is the principal criterion that a geophysicist uses to decide whether an event is a reflection or not.[tpl]Cite book| author=Sheriff, R.

[[Millwall F.C.–West Ham United F.C. rivalry]]

CATEGORIES: London derbies, Millwall F.C., West Ham United F.C., England football derbies

The rivalry between Millwall and West Ham United is one of the longest-standing and most bitter in English football. The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, both originated in the East End of London, and were located under three miles apart. Their supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards on either side of the River Thames. Consequently, each set of fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business; this intensified the tension between the teams. They first played against each other in the 1899–1900 FA Cup. In 1910 Millwall moved south of the River Thames and the teams were no longer East London neighbours. Even so, the derbies retained their passion and both sets of supporters still consider the other club their main rival. Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years, mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues. The teams have usually competed in different divisions since, spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League. They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup competitions since 1916.
The rivalry between the teams has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting in the death of a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free. As of the 2013–14 season, West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Football League Championship, the tier below.

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Trnava, Towers in Slovakia

The City Tower (in Slovak Mestská veža) is one of the most important historic monuments of Trnava, Slovakia.
The tower's construction began on 28 July 1574. In 1666 and 1683 the tower was affected by fire and since then it has remained without a roof.
The tower has a square ground plan in the shape of a solid prism with eight floors and is 57 metres high. The tower has a scenic gallery 29 metres above ground level. The corners and the highest floor are decorated with diamond sgraffito. On the south-west side is a sundial. In the alcove above the entrance is circular relief a symbol of Christ.
On the top of the tower was originally a moon with a star emblem. This symbol was replaced by a statue of the Virgin Mary sometimes between 1739–1742, but since that time it was toppled by windstorm and replaced by a life-size gilt copper statue.
In 1729 a clockwork mechanism from Franz Langer’s workshop was added to the fifth floor. The bobs weigh 300 kilograms and hang on a 30 metre  rope.
In 1818 a new entrance into the tower  was built above which was sgraffiti of Christ and the Latin lettering: Nisi dominus custodierit civitatem, frustra vigilat, gui custodit eam ("except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain", Psalm 127).
The tower was reconstructed in 1938–1941 by the Pittel and Brausvetter company. The sgraffiti were covered by plaster and the statue was re-gilded in the workshop of Peter Michaletz.
Another reconstruction took place in 1997 - 1998.

[[Provided by client]]

CATEGORIES: Auditing

Provided By Client (PBC) is a term used by audit and consulting professionals to denote that some piece of information (usually a document or file) was provided by a client. Determining the source of information is important because it will affect the information's credibility. For example, a bank statement obtained directly from the bank is more credible than a bank statement obtained from the client, since there is a risk that the client could have tampered with the statement.
At the onset of an audit or consulting engagement a PBC Request List (also referred to as a CAG, or Client Assistance Guide) is sent to the client detailing all items that the client should prepare and send back. The information obtained from the client's response is then used to conduct testing. Auditors typically rely on information provided by the client as well as external sources. This is especially true for financial auditors, who are typically held to stricter evidence standards than consultants or other auditors.

The team is considered to be the feeder team for the senior Icelandic national football team.

The team is for Icelandic players aged under 21 at the start of the calendar year in which a two-year European Under-21 Football Championship campaign begins, so some players can remain with the squad until the age of 23. As long as they are eligible, players can play for Iceland at any level, making it possible to play for the U21s, senior side, and again for the U21s. This has been the case for several senior team players like Aron Gunnarsson, Eiður Guðjohnsen, Heiðar Helguson and Kolbeinn Sigþórsson.

The Pemberton Valley is a valley flanking the Lillooet River upstream from Lillooet Lake, including the communities of Mount Currie, Pemberton, British Columbia and the agricultural district surrounding them and flanking the river as far upstream as the Pemberton Meadows area.  The term is normally used only to refer to inhabited parts of the valley, not the unsettled areas to the north of Pemberton Meadows although the official definition extends from the head of Lillooet Lake all the way up to the confluence of Meager Creek.  Historically the region was part of the Lillooet Country but due to re-orientation of the area's economy and society since the opening and expansion of BC Highway 99 the area is now more considered to be part of the Sea to Sky Country.

Niederlausitz (Lower Lusatia) is a small region for table wine and country wine in eastern Germany, which was defined in an amendment to the German wine law in 2007. It is located in Brandenburg, which is the federal state surrounding Berlin. The designation Brandenburger Landwein is used for country wines from this region.Weinverordnung (WeinV 1995), updated until Art. 1 V v. 11.3.2008 I 383, § 1 for Tafelwein and § 2 for Landwein
Lower Lusatia is not part of the 13 well-established German wine regions for quality wine (usually referred to as Anbaugebiete), and is located to the north of all of them, but south of Stargarder Land, which was defined in 2004. This means that Lower Lusatian wineries are not allowed allowed to produce wine of all quality levels of the German wine classification. Only the lower part - Tafelwein (table wine) and Landwein (country wine) - and not the higher "quality wine" categories Qualitätswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (QbA) and Prädikatswein may be produced. 
Currently, the Niederlausitz region covers only [tpl]convert|11|ha|acre[/tpl] of vineyards spread out over 14 locations.Welt Online July 5, 2007: Weinreben im Tagebaugebiet A peculiar aspect of the Niederlausitz region is that some of the vineyards are planted in former coal strip mines.Tagesspiegel.de August 25, 2007: Tagebau Kabinett – Wein aus Lausitzer Landen

Coronado, New Mexico's first state historic site to open to the public, was dedicated on May 29, 1940, as part of the Cuarto Centenario commemoration (400th Anniversary) of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado's entry into New Mexico. It is located along New Mexico Highway 550, 1 mile west of Bernalillo and 16 miles north of Albuquerque.Noble, David Grant, Ancient Ruins of the Southwest: An Archaeological Guide, Northland Publishing, Flagstaff, Arizona, 2000, p. 208
Although it is named for Vasquez de Coronado, who camped in the vicinity in 1540–1542, this archeological site is most noted for the ruins of Kuaua pueblo.  The pueblo or village was settled about 1325 and abandoned toward the end of the 16th century because of pressure from both the Navajos and the Spanish.  Kuaua was one of several Tiwa-speaking pueblos in the area when the conquistador Vasquez de Coronado arrived, and the village was almost certainly abandoned due to the after effects of the Tiguex War (February 1541).
The ruins of Kuaua Pueblo were excavated in the 1930s by an archeological team led by Edgar Lee Hewett and Marjorie F. Tichy (Lambert).  The excavation revealed a south-to-north development over the village's three centuries of existence, as well as six kivas built in round, square and rectangular shapes.  The site is particularly noted for a series of pre-contact (pre-1492) murals that were recovered from a square kiva in the pueblo's south plaza.  These murals represent one of the finest examples of pre-contact Native American art to be found anywhere in North America.  Fourteen of the restored murals are displayed in Coronado Historic Site's visitor center.
The visitor center itself was designed by Southwest architect John Gaw Meem and contains displays of Pueblo Indian and Spanish Colonial artifacts.  An interpretive trail winds through the ruins and along the west bank of the Rio Grande.

Caypullisaurus is an extinct genus of large platypterygiine ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous (Tithonian and Berriasian stages) of Argentina. Its holotype was collected from the Vaca Muerta formation of Cerro Lotena, Neuquen, dating to the early Tithonian stage of the Late Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. Caypullisaurus was first named by Marta Fernández in 1997 and the type species is Caypullisaurus bonapartei. It is a member of the family Ophthalmosauridae, and closely related to Platypterygius and Brachypterygius.Fernández M. 2007. Redescription and phylogenetic position of Caypullisaurus (Ichthyosauria: Ophthalmosauridae). Journal of Paleontology 81 (2): 368-375.

The Nicola Country, also known as the Nicola Valley and often referred to simply as The Nicola, and originally Nicolas' Country or Nicholas' Country, adapted to Nicola's Country and simplified since, is a region in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada.  It is the main subregion of the larger Thompson Country and is often referred to separately, or in combination forms, notably the Thompson-Nicola Regional District.  The combination Nicola-Similkameen is also common.
The Nicola Country is roughly synonymous with the basin of the Nicola River, but unlike other similar region-names in BC was not named for the river.  Rather, both were named as a result of this region being the territory under the rule of Nicola (Hwistesmexteqen), the most prominent and influential of the chiefs of the Nicola people, who like the river and region were named for the chief, i.e. "Nicola's people".  Nicola was the son of Pelkamulox, an Okanagan chief who, at the invitation of Kwa'lila, the Secwepemc chief of Kamloops, settled in the valley to escape harassment at his former domicile at the head of Okanagan Lake and founded there the joint community of Okanagans and Nlaka'pamux known as the Nicola people and whose government is the Nicola Tribal Association, and at one time included members of the now-extinct "Stuwix" or Nicola Athapaskans.
Other than the several First Nations reserves in the Nicola Country, there are a number of small non-indigenous settlements.  The area's only significant and largest town is Merritt, home to the Merritt Mountain Music Festival.  Also of note in the region is the Douglas Lake Ranch, one of the world's largest ranches.  Its headquarters are just west of Merritt at Douglas Lake but whose lands span most of the Thompson Plateau and also country beyond it to the northeast in the Shuswap Highland and to the north in the Bonaparate Plateau. .

The Weddell Gyre is one of the two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyre is located in the Weddell Sea, and rotates clockwise. The gyre is formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf. Due to the Coriolis force acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.

[[1947 World Ice Hockey Championships]]

CATEGORIES: 1947 in ice hockey, IIHF Men's World Ice Hockey Championships

The 14th Ice Hockey World Championship and 25th European Championship was the first after the Second World War. It was held from 15  to 23 February 1947 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Eight teams participated, but the competition was notably missing the reigning world champion, Canada. The world champion was decided for the first time by round robin league play. Czechoslovakia won the world championship for the first time and the European championship for the seventh time. King Gustav V had sent a telegram of congratulations to the Swedish team after beating the Czechs, unfortunately they had barely finished celebrating when they were upset by the Austrians, costing them the Gold.
Many notable changes were made to the rules for this championship. The game was standardized to be played in three 20 minute periods, aligning with the Canadian practice. The net size was standardized as well. There would be no more one and three minute penalties, and penalty shots were instituted.Duplacey page 502 The Congress in Brussels where all this was decided, also tried to absolve Canada's objections to the definition of what an 'amateur player' was. Canada's absence from the first post WWII games was a combination of this dispute, and a dispute over who was making the decisions (i.e. North America vs. Europe).Summary at Passionhockey.com
Also at issue was which American federation's team was the proper representative, (a dispute that nearly destroyed the following year's Olympic tournament) and how to decide which nations would receive invitations. Japan and Germany were barred from participation, but the IIHF was careful to illustrate that it was the politics, not the people, who were at fault, and allies like Austria and Italy were admitted.

[[Marian year]]
CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic Mariology, Marian devotions

Marian years are decided on and declared exclusively by the Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church. In Church history, only two Marian years were pronounced by Pope Pius XII and Pope John Paul II. 
In 1953, with the encyclical Fulgens Corona, Pope Pius ordered a Marian year for 1954, the first in Church history. The year was filled with Marian initiatives, in the areas of mariology, cultural events, and charity and social gatherings.Remigius Bäumer, Marienlexikon St. Ottilien, 1995,  534 
The Pope promotes appropriate sermons and discourses to explain Marian beliefs. The purpose is to increase the Faith of the people and their devotion to the Virgin Mother. Marian churches and Marian shrines all over the world, "or at least an altar, in which the sacred image of the Blessed Virgin Mary is enshrined" should invite to public services for the devotion of the Christian people.Fulgens Corona 31,32 The Pope invites especially to celebrations at the Grotto of Lourdes, "where there is such ardent devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary conceived without stain of sin".Fulgens Corona 33 
In 1987, Pope John Paul II initiated a Marian year in preparation of the forthcoming millennium. He published the encyclopedic Marian encyclical Redemptoris Mater, which constitutes the longest Marian encyclical ever written by a Pontiff. It represents the status of Marian belief and Mariology for the beginning of the 21st century. For the beginning of the Marian year, a large copy of the Madonna della Colonna was completed for outside Saint Peter's Square. Pope John Paul II had been approached by a student who told him that Saint Peter's Square was cold and incomplete without the portrait of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Bäumer, 535 In both Marian years, Marian devotion, Marian pilgrimages and Marian meetings were promulgated.

David Ruben Piqtoukun (born 1950) is an Inuit artist from Paulatuk, Northwest Territories. His output includes sculpture and prints; the sculptural work is innovative in its use of mixed media. His materials and imagery bring together modern and traditional Inuit stylistic elements in a personal vision. An example of this is his work "The Passage of Time" (1999), which portrays a shaman in the form of a salmon moving through a hole in a hand. While shamanic imagery is common in much of Inuit art, the hand in this work is sheet metal, not a traditional material such as walrus ivory, caribou antler or soapstone. Ruben's brother, Abraham Apakark Anghik Ruben, is also a sculptor. Fellow Inuit artist Floyd Kuptana learned sculpting techniques as an apprentice to David Ruben.

Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (USDP) was a political party in Galicia. The party was founded in 1899 as an autonomous section of the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia (and Silesia) by some members of the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia (PPSD) and the Ukrainian Radical Party in Lviv. The key leaders were Mykola Hankevych (party chairman) and Semen Vityk. It was based on the Ukrainian social democratic organization that already existed since 1897. The first congress of the party took place in Lviv in 1903. Few years later in 1906 the party was joined by its affiliate in Bukovina, the Social Democratic Party of Bukovina (leader Yosyp Bezpalko).
The Ukrainian Social Democratic Party had close ties to the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party in the Russian Empire. Ideologically the party had an Austro-Marxist orientation. It advocated the creation of an independent Ukrainian state. V. Levynsky, Y. Bachynsky and Vityk Hankevych were leading personalities of the party.28_Rosdolsky The party was active mobilizing for the 1902 peasant strikes in Husyatyn and Terebovlia counties. Until 1907 the party remained as a section of its Polish counterparts and Hankevych headed the Lviv city committee of the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia. In June 1907 the USDP has officially seceded from PPSD at the party conference. The split allowed the USDP civil organization "Liberty" (Volya) to be more active in urban communities rather than to remain outside of cities.
In 1914 the party joined the Ukrainian General Council, and adopted a pro-Austrian position. This position was however reverted in 1921, as the party adopted a pro-Soviet line advocating unification with the Soviet Ukraine, while being hostile to the Polish government as well as the exiled government of Yevhen Petrushevych. Earlier upon dissolution of the Austria-Hungary in 1918 and establishment of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, the party became an independent Ukrainian party and joined the Ukrainian National Council, but later left the coalition government creating the socialist opposition, the Peasants and Workers Union. Some Volhynian USDP members were elected to the National Sejm of Poland in 1922. By early 1920s the party became infiltrated by members of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine and at its 6th Congress in Lviv in March 1923 it changed its political platform to Communist and removing its older leader including Mykola Hankevych.
The Polish authorities outlawed the party on January 30, 1924 as one that causes threat to peace and order. After the banning, many USDP cadres joined the underground faction of Communist Party of Western Ukraine. Other members that did not joined communists, became involved in the Workers Community as a public cultural and educational society. In 1928 the party managed to revive by the Lev Hankevych's "Forward" group (Vperid). In 1933 it joined the Labor and Socialist International and in December 1934 joined the Ukrainian Socialist Bloc that also included the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance and the Ukrainian Socialist Radical Party.

[[Gospel harmony]]
CATEGORIES: 1st-century Christianity, Chronology, Christian terms, Gospel episodes, Biblical paraphrases, Lists of stories, Canonical Gospels

A Gospel harmony is an attempt to compile the Christian canonical gospels into a single account. This may take the form either of a single, merged narrative, or a tabular format with one column for each gospel, technically known as a 'synopsis', although the word 'harmony' is often used for both. Harmonies are constructed to establish a chronology of events in the life of Jesus depicted in the canonical gospels, to better understand how the accounts relate to each other, or to establish events in the life of Jesus. 
The construction of harmonies has always been favoured by more conservative scholars. Students of higher criticism, on the other hand, see the divergences between the Gospel accounts as reflecting the construction of traditions by the early Christian communities.Steven L. Cox, 2007 Harmony of the Gospels B&H Publishing ISBN 0-8054-9444-8 pages 1–2 In the modern era, attempts to construct a single story have largely been abandoned in favour of laying out the accounts in parallel columns for comparison, to allow critical study of the differences between them.The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Vol.4 (Eerdmans Publishing, 2005), page 39.
The earliest known harmony is the Diatessaron by Tatian in the 2nd century and variations based on the Diatessaron continued to appear in the Middle Ages.The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature by David Edward Aune (Nov 30, 2003) ISBN 0664219179 page 190 The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of Gospel harmonies and the parallel column structure became widespread. At this time visual representations also started appearing, depicting the Life of Christ in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony", and the trend continued into the 19th–20th centuries.

[[Bannführer]]

CATEGORIES: Nazi paramilitary ranks

Bannführer was a paramilitary rank of the Hitler Youth that was created in the mid-1930s as a result of Hitler Youth expansion throughout Nazi Germany.  The purpose of the rank was to provide more adult leadership ranks other than the previous title of Hitlerjugendführer.
Bannführer was divided into three levels, mainly the basic rank of Bannführer followed by two higher ranks of Oberbannführer and Hauptbannführer.  The insignia consisted of a leaf shoulder insignia worn on a Hitler Youth jacket.
The rank of Bannführer has made at least two appearances in modern motion pictures about World War II; mainly “Swing Kids” (where a Bannführer is shown instructing a group of Hitler Youth in boxing) and in “Europa Europa” where a Bannführer runs a Hitler Youth academy. A Bannführer also plays a relatively big role in Hitlerjunge Quex.

The plates are the same size as European plates and usually have an Azerbaijan flag and the initials 'AZ' on the left side.
According to Olavsplates, new style plates with a rectangular flag and a microchip are being introduced, but pictures of such plates are missing and very hard to find on the web.
Since January 2011 the Azerbaijan License Plate incorporates an RFiD TAG/chip, the RFiD TAG is placed on the lower left corner of the LP below the Azerbaijan national flag, in most plates the TAG has the "AZ" letters printed on. The TAG may move to the top right corner and lose the "AZ" printing on some of the more squared LP formats. The colour of the LP still varies depending on the vehicles usage and ownership.

[[Portable boat lift]]

CATEGORIES: Boat lifts

According to most sources, the definition of Portable is or connotes "Able to be easily carried or moved". Most anything can be moved but the adjective Portable commonly describes and refers to something that one can easily carry or move.   
A portable boat lift is a tool designed specifically to allow one person to transport, set up, and safely separate boats from trailers. Portable boat lifts are intended to be used on land not near, in, or on the water.
A portable boat lift is not a boat yard crane, fork lift with elongated forks, or machine; none of which can be easily transported from location to location. A portable boat lift is not a boat lift which is commonly found attached to a dock. Although some devices allow one person to separate a boat from a trailer or lift a boat up and out of the water, they are not by definition Portable.  
The term boat lift originally referred to large devices used instead of canal locks to transport canal boats horizontally as well as vertically such as the 1875 Anderton Boat Lift.  
In modern usage the term boat lift, as opposed to portable boat lift, usually refers to devices permanently installed at a dock to simply lift a boat above the water, a type of ship lift. It is not specifically designed for separating a boat from a trailer.  
Portable boat lifts may differ in design, cost, weight, and function but they are by definition, Portable. 
Prior to the introduction of portable boat lifts boat lifting work could only be performed at shops or locations that had access to cranes, machines, fork lifts, or similar lifting equipment. Portable boat lifts allow individuals, professional boat and boat trailer mechanics, boat and boat trailer painters or anyone needing to separate a boat from a trailer the ability to perform the work by themselves away from a shop. 
Portable boat lifts are relatively new to the boating industry and only a few companies manufacture these devices.

Until 1989 it listed only non-US industrial corporations under the title "International 500", while the Fortune 500 contained and still contains exclusively US corporations. In 1990, US companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.
From 2001 to 2012, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. The number of North American–based companies have reduced from 215 in 2001 to 144 in 2011, whereas the contribution of Asian-based companies have increased rapidly from 116 in 2001 to 188 in 2012.

[[South African Bureau of Standards]]

CATEGORIES: Standards organizations, ISO member bodies

The South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) is a South African statutory body that was established in terms of the Standards Act, 1945 (Act No. 24 of 1945) and continues to operate in terms of the latest edition of the Standards Act, 2008 (Act No. 29 of 2008) as the national institution for the promotion and maintenance of standardisation and quality in connection with commodities and the rendering of services.
As the national standardisation authority, the SABS is responsible for maintaining South Africa's database of more than 6,500 national standards, as well as developing new standards and revising, amending or withdrawing existing standards as required.
Internationally, SABS experts represent South Africa's interests in the development of international standards, through their engagement with bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). South Africa has a long and proud history of involvement with these bodies and was a founder member of ISO. On a regional level, the SABS currently holds the Secretariat for SADCSTAN, the standardisation body for the Southern African Development Community of 14 nations.
SABS Commercial (Pty) Ltd, a self-financing division within the SABS, offers certification, testing, consignment inspection and other services, mostly to industry. Apart from offering systems certification and product testing against the requirements of South African National Standards (SANS), SABS Commercial also operates its proprietary product certification scheme – the SABS Mark of Approval – a universally recognised icon in South Africa, assuring buyers that products are safe, fit for purpose and offer redress.
Historically, the SABS also undertook certain regulatory functions on behalf of South Africa. In keeping with best international practice, this regulatory function was separated from the organisation's standardisation and certification activities, via the promulgation of the new Standards Act and the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications Act in September 2008. Under these new laws, the former SABS Regulatory division separated to form the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS), a new organisation also residing under the Department of Trade and Industry.
The revised SABS mandate laid out in the new Standards Act also resulted in the SABS Group formulating a new Vision and Mission:
Vision:
“To be the trusted third party who offers uncompromised value-added standardisation services”
Mission:
In a move to improve its service offerings and responsiveness to customer needs, the SABS also restructured its commercial services into seven industry clusters:
This restructuring has served to provide more focused, specialised services to industry, along with improved turnaround times. Sector Boards have been established to engage with each cluster on their needs, and new cluster-specific sales teams offer the advantage of sales representatives who know their market intimately.
Headquartered in Groenkloof, Pretoria, the SABS also maintains offices in Durban, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London, and operates specialised facilities at Richards Bay, Secunda, Middelburg and Saldanha. With the opening of the SABS representative office in Shanghai, China, during April 2009, the SABS expanded its international footprint to 46 countries.
The SABS is accredited by both the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) and the Raad voor Accreditatie (RvA) of the Netherlands.
Annually the SABS has the design awards. These are awards given in technology however the claims are not properly verified.

The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous and the Burges Mous, also known as The Twa Mice,The Morall Fabillis - The Paddock and the Mouse is a Middle Scots adaptation of Aesop's Fable The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse by the Scottish poet Robert Henryson. Written around the 1480s, it is the second poem in Henryson's collection called The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian. 
Hennryson's Fabill treats its characters and incidents with a realism that was hitherto unusual in the genre. Its ambiguous portrayal of the two protagonists seamlessly blends their animal and human characteristics in a way that allowed the makar to satirise new social classes in the rising burous touns of his day with subtle and philosophical irony.

The Oxfam Glamour Models are a noise rock band from Middlesbrough in the North East of England. They signed to Marquis Cha Cha records in 2006 but split in 2007. As of August 2011 they are once again active. Members include Emmett (Vocals), Paul Dye (Guitar), Peachy (Guitar)(2004-2007) and Ryan Pilot (Drums).  The band are often referred to as The Oxford Glamour Girls for obvious reasons.  As of 2012 Oli Heffernan (Year of Birds, Idiot Savant, British Lichen Society) has been playing bass for the band.
Their first single, "Kick Out The Grams", sold out in one day[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl], was an NME runner-up single of the week,[tpl]cite web | first=Rob | last=Nichols | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Music%3A+On+The+Beat%3A+Rob+Nichols.-a0173275075 | title=On the Beat | date=11 January 2008[/tpl] and named in both Artrocker and Playlouder's top 50 singles of 2006[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl].

Having appeared on the cover of both the NME and Artrocker in the summer by November 2006, they released the follow-up to "Kick out the Grams", "8 Cans Yeah", described by Drowned in Sound as "a lo-fi mashup of The Rakes on a bender and Eddie Argos with the rage".Marwood, Ben (2006) "Oxfam Glamour Models: 8 Cans Yeah / Book Club", Drowned in Sound, 5 December 2006 
After more gigs, the band arranged studio time to record tracks for a possible album. These included 'Crack', a re-recording of 'Loves Young Scum' and several others. However, these tracks were scrapped and the band finally decided not to make an album or any other future release at present.
Following a year of line up problems, relocations and lost momentum, The Oxfam Glamour Models split in December 2007.
Paul Dye and Peter Holt went on to form, British Lichen Society. Paul was later replaced by Oli Heffernan, who has since replaced Luke Tanner in the current Oxfam Glamour Models line up.
Paul Emmett and Lucian Tanner went on to form, Education Education Education.
In July 2011 a new Facebook was set up to announce a reformation. In November, a gig was announced at the Georgian Theatre in Stockton on Tees for 16 December, the same venue they played their last gig almost exactly four years earlier.
According to the Facebook site, Peter "Peachy" Holt will not be involved in the new line up.

CATEGORIES: English explorers, Explorers of Antarctica, Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Recipients of the Albert Medal (lifesaving), 1888 births, 1916 deaths, Antarctic expedition deaths

Victor George Hayward AM (1888–1916) was a London-born accounts clerk whose taste for adventure took him to Antarctica as a member of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. He had previously spent time working on a ranch in northern Canada and this experience, combined with his "do-anything" attitude, was sufficient for him to be engaged by Shackleton as a general assistant to the Ross Sea party, a support group with a mission to lay depots for the main cross-continental party.
Hayward quickly proved himself to be hard-working and resourceful. He was one of the ten members of the shore party that was marooned when the Ross Sea party’s expedition ship Aurora broke from its McMurdo Sound moorings during a storm and was unable to return. In difficult circumstances he played a full part in the efforts of the stranded group to fulfil its mission, despite its shortages of food, proper clothing, and equipment. During the main depot-laying journey on the Great Ice Barrier in 1915–16 Hayward was one of the six who marched to the Beardmore Glacier to lay the last of the required chain of depots. On the return leg the party was struck with scurvy, which caused the death of Arnold Spencer-Smith. Although suffering badly himself, Hayward helped bring the rest of the party off the Barrier to the relative safety of the Hut Point shelter.
Hayward disappeared on 8 May 1916 while walking across the frozen surface of McMurdo Sound in the hopes of reaching the expedition’s base at Cape Evans. His body was never found. Seven years later Hayward was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal for his efforts to save the lives of his stricken companions on the Barrier journey.

[[Tommy Watt]]

CATEGORIES: 1925 births, 2006 deaths, British jazz bandleaders, British jazz pianists, Ivor Novello Award winners, Royal Air Force personnel of World War II

Tommy Watt (31 October 1925, Glasgow - 20 May 2006, Bristol, England) was a Scottish jazz bandleader.
Watt was hired as a pianist by Carl Barriteau at age 17, and served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He moved to London following the war, where he played with Ambrose, Harry Roy, and Ken Mackintosh. He teamed up with actor Brian Rix, whom he had met during the war, in 1955 to record a demo, which eventually led to a contract with the BBC. After making appearances behind Matt Monro, Parlophone hired Watt for session and arranging work. In 1956 Watt put together his first big band, which played at Quaglino's, a London restaurant. Among his sidemen were Tubby Hayes, Ronnie Ross, Jackie Armstrong, Tommy McQuater, Bert Courtley, and Phil Seaman.
Watt became one of the better-known British bandleaders of the 1950s, winning an Ivor Novello Award for the song "Overdrive" and releasing their first LP record in 1958. Watt's arrangements of Count Basie songs so impressed Basie himself that he incorporated some of Watt's changes into his own performances. After disbanding his ensemble, Watt worked with Rix on stage shows and films, including The Night We Got the Bird and Nothing Barred. He led the BBC Northern Dance Orchestra and the BBC Big Band briefly in the early 1960s, but squabbles with management quickly ended this contract. In 1964 he assembled the Centre 42 Big Band, and through the end of the decade wrote for television and directed singers Tommy Cooper and Freddie Starr.
In 1970 Watt put together a new group to perform at the Dorchester Hotel in London, but was dissatisfied with the gig and disbanded the orchestra soon after. He left music, aside from occasional piano performances, and became an interior decorator. 
He died in 2006. His son Ben Watt became famous in his own right as a member of Everything But the Girl.

Preflight,Pre-flight (printing) in the graphic arts industry, is the process of checking a digital document before it goes to plate, print or otherwise output (exported - such as to PDF). It is a way to check quality before printing, digitally or otherwise, but can also be used to check any common artwork file. Preflight may be done on the source desktop publishing document, or before creating a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. The term preflight was first used during a presentation in 1990 by Chuck Weger, a well known industry consultant. There were some early postscript RIPs that interpreted data and provided a preflight report of sorts. 
The first commercial preflight application, called "FlightCheck,"http://www.markzware.com/flightcheck_professional was introduced to the public by Markzware and appeared at the Seybold Seminars Conference at San Francisco in the Fall of 1995.Pro File: Taking Flight - Macworld 2002 U.S. Patent, number 5,963,641  was subsequently granted - ‘Device and method for examining, verifying, correcting and approving electronic documents prior to printing, transmission or recording.’

The One Who Really Loves You is the second album recorded by R&B singer and Motown recording artist Mary Wells, released in 1962 on the Motown label. Released after the runaway success of Wells' first top ten pop singles, the album became Motown's first top ten album peaking at number 8 on the pop album chart.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] The album featured the hits, "The One Who Really Loves You" and "You Beat Me to the Punch" and other singles such as the ballads "Strange Love" and "Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right".
THE ONE WHO REALLY LOVES YOU (Motown 605) has been mistakenly cited as Motown's first top ten album.  It did not chart.  It seems Wells' single "The One Who Really Loves You" which peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of June 9, 1962, has been confused with the namesake LP.  Motown's first top ten album (and first #1 album) was RECORDED LIVE LITTLE STEVIE WONDER THE 12 YEAR OLD GENIUS (Tamla 240) in 1963.  The first top ten album on the Motown label was the Supremes' WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO (Motown 621) which peaked at #2 in 1964.  Mary Wells' first charting Motown album was TWO LOVERS AND OTHER GREAT HITS (Motown 607) which reached #49 in 1963.

Buruntza (441 m) is a minor mount in the Basque Country (Spain) 12 km south of San Sebastian. Several towns lie at its foot, namely Andoain (S), Lasarte-Oria (N) and Urnieta (E). The mount stretches out in a north-east to south-west disposition, starting at the pass of Azkorte (hermitage) on to a quarry at the southern end, by the neighbourhood Buruntza in Andoain. The mount rises opposite to Adarra (E) and stands in turn to the east of the mountain Andatza (562 m). There is a big cross fixed at the summit.
The Oria River flows north along Buruntza's north-west face over a close valley run by the N-1 E-5 E-80 main road on both banks of the river. Actually, this tract was a race-car circuit between 1923 and 1935, its sinuous layout bearing witness to that origin. On the south-eastern side (Urnieta, Andoain), the outer reaches of the Urumea valley extend out south-east as a corridor, leaving the prominence of Buruntza towering right in the middle as a perfect vantage point over all the surroundings.

[[Frozen dessert]]
CATEGORIES: Frozen desserts

Frozen dessert is the generic name for desserts made by freezing liquids, semi-solids, and sometimes even solids. They may be based on flavored water (shave ice, sorbet, snow cones, etc.), on fruit purées (such as sorbet), on milk and cream (most ice creams), on custard (frozen custard and some ice creams), on mousse (semifreddo), and others.
In some countries including Canada, the term is often used on products which are similar in taste and texture to ice cream, but which do not meet the legal definition of that term (often being made primarily with vegetable oils, i.e. mellorine, as opposed to milk or cream).Dairy Farmers of Canada website

[[Funkspiel]]

CATEGORIES: Counter-intelligence, Battles and operations of World War II involving Germany, World War II deception operations, Gestapo, Abwehr operations

Funkspiel ([tpl]lang-de|radio play[/tpl]) was the name given to a counter-espionage operation carried out by Nazi counter-intelligence during the Second World War. It consisted of using captured and "turned" (meaning forced to work for the Nazis) clandestine radio operators in France to send false messages back to the enemy (the United Kingdom in particular), and allowed the Nazi services to intercept Allied military information, transmit disinformation to the enemy and to fight resistance movements. So, Nazi counter-intelligence "played" (pretended to be) a resistance movement, with a script for the piece written by the Gestapo or the Abwehr. 
The last faked message that the Nazis exchanged with London in this operation was this:  "Thank you for your collaboration and for the weapons that you sent us".  However, the Nazis did not know that the British intelligence services knew about the Nazi stratagem at least two weeks before this transmission.  Thus, if the Nazis had been able to gain certain benefits from the operation, the strategy was later used against them and from May 1944 onwards the operation was no longer a success.
A similar funkspiel, called Operation Scherhorn, was executed by the Soviet NKVD against the Nazi secret services from August 1944 to May 1945.
Funkspiel also referred to a technique of U-boat radio operators who would synchronously vary the frequency transmission knob to confuse any Allied personnel that happened to pick up the same channel.

[[Yokohama (chicken)]]
CATEGORIES: Chicken breeds, Chicken breeds originating in England, Chicken breeds originating in Japan

The Yokohama is a breed of chicken that originated from  Japanese breeds.  Yokohama is not where the breed originated, but it is the port where a French Missionary named Girad first exported the breed to Europe where further breeding would create the Yokohama known today.Hobson, Jeremy & Celia Lewis, Choosing and Raising Chickens, David and Charles publishing, London, 2009
It was developed from two different Japanese Cultural Monument breeds, the principal progenitor is the Minohiki or "Saddle Dragger". Some percentage of the ancestral founders were probably another Japanese treasure called the Onagadori, but it is likely that at the time of the founders' introduction to Europe, the lesser known Minohiki was simply not as highly celebrated as the Onagadori. Consequently, many Minohiki were likely confused with Onagadori. Regardless of which of these important breeds were more significant in the development of this unique fowl,the ancestors of today's Yokohama were imported from Yokohama, Japan.  In appearance, it most closely resembles the Minohiki breed, and to a lesser extent to the European Phoenix Breed, which probably shares many of the same ancestors. The European Phoenix however, has more Onagadori and less Minohiki in its genetic makeup, whilst the opposite is true for the Yokohama Fowl. The Black Sumatran Fowl is a close relative of the Minohiki and Yokohama.

Hugh Bradner (November 5, 1915 – May 5, 2008) was an American physicist at the University of California who is credited with inventing the neoprene wetsuit, which helped to revolutionize scuba diving.
A graduate of Ohio's Miami University, he received his doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, in 1941. He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, where he researched naval mines. In 1943, he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, he worked with scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky on the development of the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs.
After the war, Bradner took a position studying high-energy physics at the University of California, Berkeley, under Luis Alvarez. Bradner's investigated the problems encountered by frogmen staying in cold water for long periods of time. He developed a neoprene suit which could trap the water between the body and the neoprene, and thereby keep them warm. He became known as the "father of the wetsuit."[tpl]cite news |first=Michael |last=Taylor|title=Hugh Bradner, UC's inventor of wetsuit, dies |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/11/BANR10KEF8.DTL|work= San Francisco Chronicle |publisher= |date=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 23, 2008[/tpl]
Bradner worked on the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear test series on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a geophysicist in 1961. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a full professor in 1963, and retiring in 1980. In retirement, continued to work both on oceanographic research, as well as on the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project.

The Suda lists that he wrote variety of works, including one On Providence, and another called People who have Undeserved Good or Bad Fortune.Suda, Sopatros, Sigma 845.  He is distinguished from another sophist of that name "Of Apamea ... (Or rather, of Alexandria)", who wrote epitomes of very many authors and probably also the Historical Extracts,Suda, Sopatros, Sigma 848. of which PhotiusPhotius, Bibliotheca Cod. 161 has preserved a summary, from which it appears that it contained a vast variety of fact and fiction, collected from a great number of authors.
Sozomenus relates "an invention of persons who desired to vilify the Christian religion", that Constantine asked Sopater for purification after having killed his son Crispus and that Sopater denied him.Sozomen, Hist. Eccl. i. 5.
Sopater was one of many who were put to death by Constantine, sometime before 337 AD. Zosimus ascribes his death to the machinations of Ablabius.Zosimus, ii. 40 Eunapius alleges that Sopater was charged with detaining by magical arts a fleet laden with grain.Eunapius, Lives of the Sophists.

"Halfway to Paradise" is a popular song, originally recorded in 1961 by Tony Orlando in the United States. It was much more successful in the United Kingdom, recorded by Billy Fury where it reached a peak at number 3 on the British Charts in 1961.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=2878 |title=Chart Stats - Billy Fury - Halfway To Paradise |accessdate=13 May 2009[/tpl] It stayed on the charts for 23 weeks. It became known as Fury's theme tune and was one of his most popular singles. The song also marked the beginning of Fury's burst at the top of the charts that would only begin to slow down on the arrival of fellow Liverpudlian act, the Beatles.
The song was a big production for both Fury and Decca and involved a whole orchestra, directed by Ivor Raymonde.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Billy-Fury-Halfway-To-Paradise/release/541782 |title=Billy Fury - Halfway To Paradise (7") at Discogs |accessdate=13 May 2009[/tpl] Its success made Fury known for his big ballad numbers, although he began in rock and roll and was always thought of more as a rock musician.
Bobby Vinton revived "Halfway to Paradise" in a mellow, more romantic version in 1968 (Billboard No. 23). The song was included on the million selling album "I Love How You Love Me"in early 1969. It was released once again on the 1972 best selling album Bobby Vinton's All-Time Greatest Hits".
Tina Charles recorded the song for her album Dance Little Lady (1976). Nick Lowe released "Halfway to Paradise" as a single in 1977, without any chart impact. It was later released as a bonus track on the re-release of his 1978 album Jesus of Cool. Australian singer Jason Donovan recorded a cover of the song for his album Let It Be Me (2008).
The song is also referred to in an episode of the 1970s sitcom "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads" in which Bob and Terry argue over who it was sung by, Bob erroneously claiming it was by Paul Anka whilst Terry rightly argues the artist to be Billy Fury. The scene ends with Terry loudly reciting a lyric from the song, "I want to be your lover, but your friend is all I'll be" which the landlord of the pub they are in overhears and assumes the lads to be a gay couple, telling them in no uncertain terms "You two fairies - out!".

[[Władysław Koba]]

CATEGORIES: 1914 births, 1949 deaths, Polish resistance fighters, Unpersons in the Eastern Bloc

Wladyslaw Antoni Koba (noms de guerre Marcin Gruda, Rak, Tor, Zyla) was a soldier of the Polish Army, Home Army and Freedom and Independence, who participated in the Polish September Campaign, in the activities of the Polish resistance movement in World War II as well as the Anti-communist resistance in Poland. 
He was born on January 8, 1914 in Jarosław, in a middle-class, patriotic family. In 1932 Koba graduated from the Second High School in his native town, and soon afterwards he was accepted into the Infantry Officers School (Szkola Podchorazych Piechoty) in Komorowo near Warsaw. In 1938 Koba was promoted to First Lieutenant, and returned to serve in the Third Legions Infantry Regiment in Jarosław. As a soldier of this unit, he fought in the Polish September Campaign, in the area of Sieradz, then withdrew to the fortress of Modlin. After capitulation, Koba was transferred to a POW officers camp in Działdowo (Stalag II Soldau), but in late 1939 was released under condition that he would regularly report to the Wehrmacht's Ortskommando.
Koba settled in his hometown, but left it and hid in a village near Przeworsk, using the new name Marcin Gruda. He became a member of the Service for Poland's Victory (later Home Army), helping with training, also organizing different acts of sabotage and training young soldiers of the Polish resistance. In the summer of 1944, he took part in Operation Tempest and for his services, he was twice awarded the Cross of Valor (in 1939 and 1944) as well as Cross of the Home Army.
When the Red Army entered the area of Rzeszów, he was sought for by the NKVD and Polish security services. After dissolution of the Home Army (January 1945), Koba, who had been promoted to captain, entered the Freedom and Independence anticommunist armed organization, becoming commandant of the Przemyśl area. He was arrested on September 26, 1947 and put in the infamous prison, located in the Rzeszów Castle. On October 21, 1948, Koba was sentenced to death, which was confirmed by pro-Soviet, puppet president of Poland, Bolesław Bierut. Wladyslaw Koba was executed on January 31, 1949 at 20:30 in the Rzeszów Castle prison. His body was buried in a mass grave on the Zwieczyca Cemetery in Rzeszów. He had two children - daughter Marta and son Wojciech. 
On February 5, 1992, Warsaw Military District Court voided the sentence. On May 3, 2008, Koba was posthumously awarded the Polonia Restituta, by President Lech Kaczyński.

Olga Engl made her film debut in the 1911 British silent film The Adoptive Child then returned to Germany and began appearing in German film productions. Her first major role was in the 1913 Carl Froelich-directed biopic Richard Wagner. She would work continually throughout the 1910s and appear in a variety of roles for such directors as Urban Gad and Frederic Zelnik and opposite such popular actors of the era as Emil Jannings, Alfred Abel and Lya Mara.
By the early 1920s, Engl's career in motion pictures was well established. In 1922 she appeared in the popular F.W. Murnau-directed eerie drama Phantom opposite Alfred Abel, Grete Berger, Aud Egede-Nissen, Lya De Putti and Lil Dagover.Allmovie.com

The fifth series was something of a departure; it was the first to include two-part episodes and introduced a small number of new characters such as Compo's oft-mentioned but never seen nephew and was also notable for an increase in the more physical comedy for which the programme would become more well-known latterly.
The fifth series was released on DVD in region 2 as a combined box set with series 6 on 5 March 2007.

CATEGORIES: 1937 births, 2008 deaths, Zimbabwean football managers

Sam Dauya (October 22, 1937 – May 11, 2008) was the Zimbabwean founder of the Dynamos F.C. football team, which was founded in 1963 and is based in Harare.[tpl]cite news |first=Grace |last=Chingoma |title=Zimbabwe: Dynamos Founding Father Dauya Dies |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200805140460.html |work= The Herald (Zimbabwe) |publisher=AllAfrica.com |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl]
sam was born to Malawian parents in Waterfalls, Zimbabwe, on October 22, 1937. He attended St Michael's School as a student. His first job following the completion of his studies was as a credit controller at Zimbabwe Furnishers, which at the time was owned by Teddy Cohen.
sam began thinking of starting his own soccer team in the early 1960s, after authorities in what was then known as Rhodesia started a professional football in 1962 composed exclusively of white players.   Blacks were not permitted to play on the Rhodesian teams. Coincidentally, two black football teams, Salisbury City and Salisbury United, were disbanded at approximately this time. Dauya approached members of the defunct teams about starting a new football club for black players.
Dynamos F.C. was officially founded in 1963, composed of players from black townships surrounding Harare. Dauya personally designed the team's first logo and wrote the club's constitution.
Sam Dauya died at a private hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe, on May 11, 2008, at the age of 70. He died just one day after Dynamos F.C. defeated the current African champions, Etoile du Sahel. Mourners gathered to remember Dauya at his home at Number 6 Smit Crescent in Eastlea, Zimbabwe. He was survived by three children Terry, Caroline and Jackie. He has eight grandchildren Tim, Will, Jon, Theo, Eli, Malachai, Livia and Jonathan

is a field that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, dynamical systems and number theory.
Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the iteration of self-maps of the complex plane or real line. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, [tpl]math|p[/tpl]-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a polynomial or rational function. A fundamental goal is to describe arithmetic properties in terms of underlying geometric structures.
Global arithmetic dynamics refers to the study of analogues of classical Diophantine geometry  in the setting of discrete dynamical systems, while local arithmetic dynamics, also called p-adic or nonarchimedean dynamics, is an analogue of classical dynamics in which
one replaces the complex numbers C by a [tpl]math|p[/tpl]-adic field such as Q[tpl]math|p[/tpl] or C[tpl]math|p[/tpl] and studies chaotic behavior and the Fatou and Julia sets.
The following table describes a rough correspondence between Diophantine equations, especially abelian varieties, and dynamical systems:

Karl Hinds is a British rapper and producer within the British Hip Hop scene. He has pursued his musical interest since he was 15, Karl had and still remains with his sights set high and began his venture by setting up his own label, Assassin Records. Although intentions were to break through the Hip Hop scene Karl developed a craft in a style of Dance music called Jungle to accommodate the genre at date.
‘Roughneck Sister Sue’ the first official single released in 1993 which is credited under the name of R.A.W, was an underground success but proved to be a steep learning curve for Karl on how to structure the labels expenditure and profits. Following singles included ‘Cock Out & Ride’, ‘Feelin (Gal A Fuss)/Zero’ and by the time Karl had produced and released the fourth single the label had been established as a Drum & Bass record label, which led Karl into perfecting this brand and released 20 singles through Assassin Records all under different alliances.
Whilst building his empire and reclaiming successful hits within the Dance genres, Karl decided to broaden his music horizons with a sister label, Ill Flava Records, where he focused on Hip Hop.Kwaku (2001) "Karl Hinds "Relate to Me"", Billboard, 2 June 2001, p. 42, retrieved 2011-01-01 In 2000 the classic record ‘Don Gramma’ which earned Karl UKHH award nominations for Best Newcomer, Best Single 2001 and won the award for Best Video of that year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Like many great producers Karl had created a unique sound that distinguishes him as an artist and producer, and he began to challenge the convention sound of UK Hip Hop.

He demonstrated his ability to write conceptually with  tracks such as ‘Rasharn’, ‘31/09 One Day Of My Life’ and ‘Take It Back’ featuring Estelle. ‘Hindsight’ is considered a classic with the lead single ‘Don Gramma’ officially named as one of the greatest UK Hip Hop records of all time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 1944 births, Living people, American artists, 20th-century American painters, 21st-century American painters, American printmakers, Carnegie Mellon University alumni, Artists from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Richard Rappaport, born 1944 in Pittsburgh, is a classically trained painter of portraits and large-scale figurative works whose pictorial evolution has spiraled towards and away from the Renaissance ideal for half a century.  
In his work, even when taking the image to abstraction, Rappaport keeps the iconic figure as primal source. Besides portraits of psychological depth, Rappaport, in the tradition of painting as an act of remembrance, borrows Christian iconography to represent the Holocaust, the civil war in Biafra, and the war in Vietnam. 
A former student and friend of Robert L. Lepper at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, Rappaport is one of the artists influenced by Lepper’s course “Individual and Social Analysis”. 
His 1989 paper “Robert Lepper, Carnegie Tech, and the Oakland Project”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/carnegie-tech-richard-lepper-and-the-oakland-project/oclc/25336396&referer=brief_results |title=Robert Lepper, Carnegie Tech, and the Oakland Project |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05[/tpl] is the principal source on Lepper’s influence on Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, Mel Bochner, and Jonathan Borofsky when they were Lepper’s students. 
Since 1981 Rappaport’s use of the advertisement pages of international art magazines as a place of exhibition has been his principal form of public presence. This includes issues of Art in America, Artforum, Flash Art, Bomb, Modern Painters, World Art, The New Criterion, and Limn.

In March 1986, incumbent George Wallace announced that he would not seek a fifth term as governor, ending an era in Alabama politics.  Many people anticipated that the winner of the Democratic primary would win the election.

Recipes vary widely.  Lekach is usually a dense, loaf-shaped cake, but some versions are similar to sponge cake or pound cake, with the addition of honey and spices, sometimes with coffee or tea for coloring. Others versions are more like gingerbread or lebkuchen.
The Jewish tradition of honeyed cakes may date back to  basbousa (sometimes spelled basboosa), an ancient Egyptian cake, variations of which are still enjoyed throughout the Middle East.
A very traditional honey cake from Austria contains an equal weight of white rye flour and dark honey, strong coffee instead of water, cloves, cinnamon, allspice, and golden raisins in the loaf, with slivered almonds on top of the loaf. Of course it also has a fair amount eggs, vegetable oil (probably corn), salt, and baking powder.

The station closed on 1 April 1857, with all services transferred to the adjacent [tpl]stnlnk|Southport Chapel Street[/tpl], though the station buildings remained in use as a goods depot. An expansion of Chapel Street in 1914 swallowed the site completely, though its name was preserved with platforms 12 and 13 dubbed the "London Street Excursion Platforms". When Chapel Street was rebuilt in the early 1970s, the excursion platforms were filled in to make space for a car park.

The 40 surviving milestones were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Massachusetts has a total of 129 surviving milestones including those along the upper Post Road.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Gage|first1=Mary E.|last2=Gage|first2=James E.|title=Milestones & Guideposts of Massachusetts and Southeastern New Hampshire|year=2014|publisher=Powwow River Books|location=Amesbury, MA|isbn=978-0-9816141-7-5|pages=155–160 [/tpl]
The first stone was erected by Paul Dudley, one of the prominent citizens of early 18th century Massachusetts, in Roxbury, which was at the time a separate community.  Roxbury was located at the end of the Boston Neck, a narrow isthmus separating the mainland from the Shawmut Peninsula, where Boston was located.  Travelers going by land from Boston to other areas had to travel over the neck and through Roxbury to reach their destinations. The Roxbury junction where Dudley placed the first stone was where several routes branched, heading south and west across New England.
Dudley erected several stones along the road from Boston to Cambridge which wound its way from Beacon Hill along what is now Washington Street through the Dudley Square area to what is now Huntington Avenue, then along Harvard Street through Brookline Village, Coolidge Corner, and Allston crossing into Cambridge at the Great Bridge, where modern JFK Street in Cambridge becomes North Harvard Street in Allston. The stones that Mr. Dudley erected have the initial PD on them, usually at the bottom of the stone.http://www.jphs.org/colonial/colonial-stones-mark-miles-from-old-roxbury-to-old-state-house.html The most chatty of these milestones (not part of this collection), is inscribed P Dudley rather than PD, and is located on the corner of Centre and South Streets in Jamaica Plain.
The stones listed for miles 23 through 29 in Wayland and Sudbury are actually guideposts rather than milestones. They do not list any mileage. They were erected at road intersections rather than at the mile marks. The stones are quarried granite posts with plug & feather tool marks and post-date 1800.

Alexander Hay (8 January 1865 – 8 May 1941) was a New Zealand-born Australian politician. 
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, he was educated there at Auckland Grammar School. Upon inheriting estates in Queensland, he migrated to Australia in 1893, becoming a grazier in New South Wales. 
In the first federal election, he unsuccessfully contested the seat of Illawarra as a Protectionist; in 1914 he contested Hunter (again unsuccessfully) as a Liberal. In 1919, he was elected to the House of Representatives as a Nationalist, representing the seat of New England. He had also been endorsed by the Farmers and Settlers' Association, and joined the Country Party when it was formed in 1920. His tendency to vote against his party resulted in his expulsion in 1922. He contested the election of that year as an independent but was unsuccessful. He retired from politics and returned to farming, dying in 1941.[tpl]cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=Australian Election Archive|work=Psephos, Adam Carr's Election Archive|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080514001510/http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia| archivedate= 14 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The Pedra Branca dispute was a territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over several islets at the eastern entrance to the Singapore Strait, namely Pedra Branca (previously called Pulau Batu Puteh and now Batu Puteh by Malaysia), Middle Rocks and South Ledge. The dispute began in 1979 and was largely resolved by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2008, which opined that Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore and Middle Rocks belonged to Malaysia.
In early 1980, Singapore lodged a formal protest with Malaysia in response to a map published by Malaysia in 1979 claiming Pedra Branca. In 1989 Singapore proposed submitting the dispute to the ICJ. Malaysia agreed to this in 1994. In 1993, Singapore also claimed the nearby islets Middle Rocks and South Ledge. In 1998 the two countries agreed on the text of a Special Agreement that was needed to submit the dispute to the ICJ. The Special Agreement was signed in February 2003, and the ICJ formally notified of the Agreement in July that year. The hearing before the ICJ was held over three weeks in November 2007 under the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia v. Singapore).
Singapore argued that Pedra Branca was terra nullius, and that there was no evidence the island had ever been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate. In the event the Court did not accept this argument, Singapore contended that sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore due to the consistent exercise of authority over the island by Singapore and its predecessor, the United Kingdom. The actions taken included selecting Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and constructing the lighthouse, requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits, installing a military rebroadcast station on the island, and studying the feasibility of reclaiming land around the island. Malaysia had remained silent in the face of these activities. In addition, it had confirmed in a 1953 letter that Johor did not claim ownership of the island, and had published official reports and maps indicating that it regarded Pedra Branca as Singapore territory. Middle Rocks and South Ledge should be regarded as dependencies of Pedra Branca.
Malaysia's case was that Johor had original title to Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge. Johor had not ceded Pedra Branca to the United Kingdom, but had merely granted permission for the lighthouse to be built and maintained on it. The actions of the United Kingdom and Singapore in respect of the Horsburgh Lighthouse and the waters surrounding the island were not actions of the island's sovereign. Further, the 1953 letter had been unauthorized and the official reports and maps it had issued were either irrelevant or inconclusive.
On 23 May 2008, the Court ruled that Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty, while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia. As regards South Ledge, the Court noted that it falls within the apparently overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.

The award was established by Eric Friedheim (1910–2002), the publisher of Travel Agent magazine and a patron of the arts, and funded by the Eric Friedheim Foundation and the Kennedy Center Corporate Fund. He endowed the award in honor of his father, the pianist Arthur Friedheim (1859–1932), who had studied with Franz Liszt.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E5DF123EF935A3575AC0A9649C8B63

There was no fourth prize until 1984, and the third prize was originally $500. The winners were narrowed down from often over 100 entries, to four or five finalists. The works were performed and the awards were given at an awards ceremony, which was held each year at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The award alternated every other year between orchestral and chamber music.
From 1978 to 1995, 18 Friedheim Awards concerts were performed, drawn from 1,883 submissions, and a total of $158,500 in cash prizes was distributed to 70 American composers.
The awards came to an end following the last ceremony in 1995, when Eric Friedheim decided to withdraw his financial support, choosing to instead donate his remaining financial assets to the Peabody Institute.

Acord was a native of Clarendon, the seat of Donley County in the Texas Panhandle some sixty miles east of Amarillo. He attended college for two years and worked as an electrician, when on August 18, 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in Lubbock, Texas.NARA - AAD - Display Full Records - Electronic Army Serial Number Merged File, ca. 1938 - 1946 (Enlistment Records)  In 1943, Acord was a young test pilot stationed at Ladd Field, now Fort Wainwright, an Army post in Fairbanks. He flew planes with the Cold Weather Testing Station and experimented with heating systems and landing planes with skis. He left the then United States Air Force with the rank of major.  Subsequently, he was awarded the Alaska-Siberia Lend Lease Award for his contributions to Russian-North American relations during World War II.
Acord had a vast knowledge of aeronautics. He recorded an oral history of the technical details of his flights. His wife of fifty years, Marion Acord, who survived him, took detailed notes for the benefit of future researchers. Mike Cox, a former manager at Pioneer Park, which houses the aviation museum, said that Acord possessed a "depth of knowledge about anything related to aviation . . . a treasure trove of information."newsminer.com • Fairbanks, Alaska
Acord conceived the idea for the museum in the late 1970s when the military was considering closing Fort Wainwright. However, the post remains open. The museum opened to the public in 1992 after Acord spent thousands of dollars of his own money to overcome construction setbacks.[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2011|reason=It would help to understand what "construction setbacks" means, as I'm pretty sure the building which houses the museum was built decades before 1992.[/tpl]
Acord told the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that "There is so much history going away nowadays. People don't record events, and then they pass on, and it's gone. I would like to see this history passed on to the younger people of this country."
Acord flew a small carrier for several years and went into business as a food distributor to outlying villages. He continued to fly until he was in his early eighties. He died in Fairbanks from complications of pneumonia.

The traditional Occitan music in the Occitan Valleys of Italy, along with the language and religion are a fundamental element of aggregation for the local community. They mostly consist of ballads, mainly in the Occitan territories of Piedmont; performed during almost all occasions of celebration in the valleys and are well known even outside the boundaries of Occitan Valleys of Italy. 
The ruggedness and impervious nature of the valleys has resulted in each valley having kept its own melodies and dances, different steps and patterns from those of adjacent valleys. 
A few of the instruments traditionally used are the accordion, clarinet, violin, organ, as well as the hurdy-gurdy (vioulo), the diatonic button accordion (semitoun) with pinfre (various wind instruments) and the harmonica (ourganin).

Riff Raff is a 1984 album by Welsh rock musician Dave Edmunds. The album was his third release for Arista Records (in the UK) and Columbia Records (in the US), following 1983's Information.
Riff Raff continued Edmunds' collaboration with Electric Light Orchestra frontman Jeff Lynne; Lynne produced six tracks on the albums, and wrote three of the songs as well. However, compared to the pair's success with Information (which hit #51 on the Billboard 200 album chart and spawned a top-40 single in "Slipping Away"), Riff Raff was a commercial flop. The album made it to only #140, and the single "Something About You" failed to crack the Billboard Hot 100 at all (although it did hit #18 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart).
Riff Raff was the last time Edmunds and Lynne would collaborate on record; meanwhile, Edmunds wouldn't make another studio album for six years (although he would release a live album in the interim).
The majority of the tracks on Riff Raff are originals by Lynne, Edmunds, and bandmember John David. The most notable cover is the aforementioned "Something About You", originally a top-20 hit for the Four Tops in 1965.

CATEGORIES: Individual cats, 1947 animal births, 1968 animal deaths

Room 8 (1947–1968) was a neighborhood cat who wandered into a classroom in 1952 at Elysian Heights Elementary School in Echo Park, California. He lived in the school during the school year and then disappeared for the summer, returning when classes started again.  This pattern continued without interruption until the mid-1960s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.explorehistoricalif.com/room8.html|title=Room 8, The Most Famous Cat in Los Angeles|last=Vargo|first=Roger|date=May 2008|publisher=Explore Historic California|accessdate=2008-05-27[/tpl]
News cameras would arrive at the school at the beginning of the year waiting for the cat's return; he became famous and would receive up to 100 letters a day addressed to him at the school. Eventually, he was featured in a documentary called Big Cat, Little Cat and a children's book, A Cat Called Room 8. Look magazine ran a three-page Room 8 feature by photographer Richard Hewett in November 1962, titled "Room 8: The School Cat". Leo Kottke wrote an instrumental called "Room 8" that was included in his 1971 album, Mudlark.
As he got older, Room 8 was injured in a cat fight and suffered from feline pneumonia, so a family near the school volunteered to take him in. The school's janitor would find him at the end of the school day and carry him across the street.
His obituary in the Los Angeles Times rivaled that of major political figures, running three columns with a photograph. The cat was so famous that his obituary ran in papers as far away as Hartford, Connecticut. The students raised the funds for his gravestone.  He is buried at the Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park in Calabasas, California.
Elysian Heights Elementary School has a wall mural on the outside of the school that features Room 8, and the teachers read his book to each new class.  Room 8's paw prints are immortalized in cement on the sidewalk outside the school.
In 1972, a cat shelter was started in his name called The Room 8 Memorial Foundation.
