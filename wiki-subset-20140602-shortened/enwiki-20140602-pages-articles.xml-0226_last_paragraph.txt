[[Semiotic democracy]]
CATEGORIES: Media studies

Semiotic democracy is a phrase first coined by John Fiske, a media studies professor, in his seminal media studies book Television Culture (1987).John Fiske, Television Culture (Routledge, 1987). Fiske defined the term as the "delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to television's viewers."[tpl]rp|236[/tpl] Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show's producer.
Subsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of cultural imagery by someone who is not the original author. Examples include Harry Potter slash fiction that reworks J. K. Rowling's characters into homosexual romances.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Legal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, copyright and right-to-publicity law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.See, e.g., Siva Vaidhyanathan, 'Critical Information Studies: A Bibliographic Manifesto' (2006) 20 Cultural Studies 292.
Prof. Terry Fisher of Harvard Law School has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.William W Fisher, Promises to Keep: Technology, Law and the Future of Entertainment (Stanford University Press, 2004).

[[James Stephens (author)]]
CATEGORIES: 1882 births, 1950 deaths, Irish fantasy writers, Irish novelists, Irish poets, Irish writers, Irish short story writers, People from County Dublin

James Stephens (9 February 1880[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colinsmythe.co.uk/authors/jamesstephens/stephens2.htm |title=James Stephens |publisher=Colinsmythe.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl] – 26 December 1950) was an Irish novelist and poet.
James' mother worked in the home of the Collins family of Dublin and was adopted by them. He attended school with his adopted brothers Thomas and Richard (Tom and Dick) before graduating as a solicitor's clerk. They competed and won several athletic competitions despite James' slight stature (he stood 4'10" in his socks).  He was known affectionately as 'Tiny Tim'.  He was much enthralled by tales of military valour of his adoptive family and would have been a soldier except for his height. By the early 1900s James was increasingly inclined to socialism and the Irish language (he could speak and write Irish) and by 1912 was a dedicated Irish Republican. He was a close friend of the 1916 leader Thomas MacDonagh, who was then editor of "The Irish Review", manager of the Irish Theatre and deputy headmaster in St Enda's, the radical bilingual Montessori school run by PH Pearse, and spent most with MacDonagh in 1911. His growing nationalism brought a schism with his adopted family.
James Stephens produced many retellings of Irish myths and fairy tales. His retellings are marked by a rare combination of humour and lyricism (Deirdre, and Irish Fairy Tales are often especially praised).  He also wrote several original novels (Crock of Gold, Etched in Moonlight, Demi-Gods) based loosely on Irish fairy tales.  "Crock of Gold," in particular, achieved enduring popularity and was reprinted frequently throughout the author's lifetime.http://www.poemhunter.com/james-stephens/biography/
Stephens began his career as a poet with the tutelage of "Æ" (George William Russell). His first book of poems, "Insurrections," was published in 1909. His last book, "Kings and the Moon" (1938), was also a volume of verse.
During the 1930s, Stephens had some acquaintance with James Joyce, who mistakenly believed that they shared a birthday. Joyce, who was concerned with his ability to finish what later became Finnegans Wake, proposed that Stephens assist him, with the authorship credited to JJ & S (James Joyce & Stephens, also a pun for the popular Irish whiskey made by John Jameson & Sons). The plan, however, was never implemented, as Joyce was able to complete the work on his own.
During the last decade of his life, Stephens found a new audience through a series of broadcasts on the BBC.

Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) is the United States' system for intercepting incoming warheads in space. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) carrying nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. GMD is administered by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while the operational control and execution is provided by the U.S. Army, and support functions are provided by the U.S. Air Force. Previously known as National Missile Defense (NMD), the name was changed in  2002 to differentiate it from other U.S. missile defense programs, such as space-based and sea-based intercept programs, or defense targeting the boost phase and reentry flight phases.Reorganization of the Missile Defense Program: Hearing Before the S.

CATEGORIES: 1821 births, 1882 deaths, American activists, American labor leaders, Pennsylvania political activists, People from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Uriah Smith Stephens (August 3, 1821 - February 13, 1882) was a U.S. labor leader. He led nine Philadelphia garment workers to found the Knights of Labor in 1869, a more successful early national union. 
Stephens longed to be a Baptist minister but never entered the field. In 1846, he moved to Philadelphia, where he worked as a tailor and became very active in politics. He ran for the United States Congress in 1878 on the Greenback–Labor ticket, but lost. He was responsible for the incorporation of the word "labor" in this party’s name.
Stephens was initiated an Entered Apprentice Mason in Kensington Lodge No. 211 in Philadelphia on December 9, 1864; passed to the Degree of Fellowcraft on February 25, 1865; and raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason on March 24, 1865. He was also a member of Keystone Lodge No. 2, Knights of Pythias, and Fidelity Lodge No. 138, Independent Order of Odd Fellows.
Stephens’ involvement with Masonry began during the same period of his initial involvement with organized labor. In 1862, he helped to organize the Garment Cutters’ Union, which survived for only seven years. At his invitation, a few members of the recently demised union met at his home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1869. At this meeting, he unfolded his plan for the "Noble and Holy Order of Knights of Labor" as a "brotherhood of toil" open to every laborer, mechanic, and artisan who wanted to improve his mind and condition, regardless of country, creed, or color. At the new order’s second meeting on December 28, 1869, Stephens’ ritual, Adelphon Kruptos (Secret Brotherhood), was officially adopted. In this opus, Stephens expressed his conviction that the "Everlasting Truth sealed by the Grand Architect of the Universe" is that "everything of value, or merit, is the result of creative Industry." Ritualistic work included lectures on the nobility of labor and the evils of wage, slavery, monopoly, and accumulation. Stephens selected an equilateral triangle within a circle as the new order’s emblem, embellishing it with symbolism from the various lodges to which he belonged.
The Knights of Labor elected Stephens as the first local Master Workman, the first District Master Workman, and the first Grand Master Workman. By 1879, there were 23 district assemblies and 1,300 local assemblies. At that time, Stephens resigned the highest office in the order and was replaced by Terence V. Powderly. The decision resulted from a policy shift experienced the previous year—which he opposed—when the General Assembly, mainly due to pressures exerted by Roman Catholic members, had voted to make public the name of the order, omit scriptural quotations from the ritual, and edit the initiation ceremonies to make them less offensive to the Catholic Church. On January 1, 1882, after five years of debate regarding the wisdom of secrecy, the Knights of Labor became a public organization.
Stephens died on February 13, 1882. He was buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Philadelphia. At the time of his death, he was estranged from the order he had founded and guided for nearly a decade. Nevertheless, he was still revered by many Knights. As a result, when the General Assembly convened in Richmond, Virginia, in 1886, they voted to appropriate $10,000 to erect a home for the family of their founder.

Archibald Scott Cleghorn (November 15, 1835 – November 1, 1910) was a Scottish businessman who married into the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
He was born on November 15, 1835 in Edinburgh, Scotland, to Thomas Cleghorn and wife, Janet Nisbet. In 1851, at the age of 16, Cleghorn traveled with his parents to Honolulu, where his father established a dry goods store. His father died within the year, and his mother left for New Zealand, but Archibald remained in Hawaii and continued running the store.

Stuart Ernest Piggott CBE (28 May 1910–23 September 1996) was a British archaeologist best known for his work on prehistoric Wessex.
Born in Petersfield, Hampshire, Piggott was educated at Churcher's College and on leaving school in 1927 took up a post as assistant at Reading Museum where he developed an expertise in Neolithic pottery.
In 1928 he joined the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales  and spent the next 5 years producing a revolutionary study of the site of Butser Hill, near Petersfield. He also worked with Eliot and Cecil Curwen on their excavations at The Trundle causewayed enclosure in Sussex.
In the 1930s he began working for Alexander Keiller, an amateur archaeologist who funded his work from the profits of his Dundee marmalade business. The two dug numerous sites in Wessex including Avebury and Kennet Avenue. In 1933, he joined his friend Grahame Clark in writing the highly significant, ‘The age of the British flint mines’, (Antiquity,1933); the resultant controversy brought about the founding of the Prehistoric Society. Still without any formal archaeological qualification, Piggott enrolled at Mortimer Wheeler's Institute of Archaeology, taking his diploma in 1936 and where he also met his wife, Peggy (Margaret Guido). In 1937 he published another seminal paper, The early Bronze Age in Wessex and with his wife went on in June 1939 to join the burial chamber excavations at Sutton Hoo at the invitation of Charles Phillips.
During the Second World War Piggott worked as an air photo interpreter and was posted to India where he spent time studying the archaeology of the sub-continent, eventually leading him to write the books Some Ancient Cities of India (1946) and Prehistoric India (1950). These experiences provided him with a valuable external view of European prehistory, which was to prove useful on his return to Britain.
After the war he went to Oxford studying the work of William Stukeley but in 1946 was soon offered the Abercromby Chair in archaeology at Edinburgh University succeeding Vere Gordon Childe. Piggott succeeded in making Edinburgh an archaeology department of international standing. He continued to publish widely including Neolithic Cultures of the British Isles (1954) which was considered highly influential until radiocarbon dating tests did not match its chronology. Piggott said that radiocarbon dating was "archaeologically unacceptable", because every other shred of evidence pointed towards his dates being correct. Ancient Europe (1965), however remained a popular survey of Old World prehistory for more than twenty years, demonstrating his view of the solidarity and continuity of the past in Europe. In 1956 his childless marriage ended.
In 1958 Piggott published a survey of Scottish prehistory, Scotland before History and, in 1959 one of a popular introductory volume, Approach to Archaeology. He was president of the Prehistoric Society from 1960 to 1963, then president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1967 to 1972, then president of the Council for British Archaeology from 1967 to 1970, and a trustee of the British Museum between 1968 and 1974). In 1963, he produced a thorough analysis of the Beaker culture in Britain, published as part of a Festschrift dedicated to Cyril Fox. Piggott's interest in the early history of the practice of archaeology led to him writing The Druids in 1968 whilst other books included Prehistoric Societies  (with Grahame Clark),  The Earliest Wheeled Transport (1983), followed by its sequel Wagon, Chariot and Carriage (1992) . His final book was Ancient Britain and the Antiquarian Imagination (1989).
He received the CBE in 1972, and was awarded numerous academic awards from scholarly institutions in Britain and abroad. He retired from the Abercrombie Chair in 1977 and awarded the gold medal of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1983 and the Grahame Clark medal of the British Academy in 1992. He died of a heart attack at his home near Wantage in Berkshire on 23 September 1996 and his remains were cremated on 30 September at Oxford crematorium
Sites he excavated (often with Richard Atkinson) included:

[[Adversary (cryptography)]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic attacks

In cryptography, an adversary (rarely opponent, enemy) is a malicious entity whose aim is to prevent the users of the cryptosystem from achieving their goal (primarily privacy, integrity, and availability of data). An adversary's efforts might take the form of attempting to discover secret data, corrupting some of the data in the system, spoofing the identity of a message sender or receiver, or forcing system downtime.
Actual adversaries, as opposed to idealized ones, are referred to as attackers. Not surprisingly, the former term predominates in the cryptographic and the latter in the computer security literature. Eve, Mallory, Oscar and Trudy are all adversarial characters widely used in both types of texts.
This notion of an adversary helps both intuitive and formal reasoning about cryptosystems by casting security analysis of cryptosystems as a 'game' between the users and a centrally co-ordinated enemy. The notion of security of a cryptosystem is meaningful only with respect to particular attacks (usually presumed to be carried out by particular sorts of adversaries). 
There are several types of adversaries depending on what capabilities or intentions they are presumed to have. Adversaries may be 
and so on. In actual security practice, the attacks assigned to such adversaries are often seen, so such notional analysis is not merely theoretical.
How successful an adversary is at breaking a system is measured by its advantage. An adversary's advantage is the difference between the adversary's probability of breaking the system and the probability that the system can be broken by simply guessing. The advantage is specified as a function of the security parameter.

[[Adam (given name)]]
CATEGORIES: Hebrew masculine given names

Adam is a common masculine given name.
The personal name Adam derives from the Hebrew noun ha adamah meaning "the ground" or "earth". It is still a Hebrew given name, and its Quranic and Biblical usage has ensured that it is also a common name in all countries which draw on these traditions. It is particularly common in Scotland. In most languages its spelling is the same, although the pronunciation varies somewhat. Adán is the Spanish form of this name. 
Adam is also a surname in many countries, although it is not as common in English as its derivative Adams (sometimes spelled Addams). In other languages there are similar surnames derived from Adam, such as Adamo, Adamov, Adamowicz, Adamski etc.
In Arabic, Adam (آدم) means "made from the earth/mud/clay".

It was founded in the 1880s by cigar manufacturers and was populated by thousands of immigrants, mainly from Spain, Cuba, and Italy. For the next 50 years, workers in Ybor City's cigar factories would roll millions of cigars annually.
The neighborhood had features unusual among contemporary immigrant communities in the southern United States, most notably its multi-ethnic and multi-racial population and their many mutual aid societies.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1427&ResourceType=District |title=National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) |publisher=Tps.cr.nps.gov |accessdate=2008-12-26[/tpl] A slow exodus out of the area that began during the Great Depression accelerated after World War II, leading to a period of abandonment and decay. After decades of neglect, a portion of the original neighborhood has redeveloped into a night club and entertainment district.
The neighborhood has been designated as a National Historic Landmark District, and several structures in the area are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, 7th Avenue, the main commercial thoroughfare in Ybor City, was recognized as one of the “10 Great Streets in America” by the American Planning Association.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2008/10/06/daily28.html |title=Historical 7th Avenue in Ybor City recognized - Tampa Bay Business Journal: |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2008-12-26[/tpl] In 2010 Columbia Restaurant was named a "Top 50 All-American icon" by Nation's Restaurant News magazine.http://www.nationsrestaurantnews-digital.com/nationsrestaurantnews/20100125/?pg=3#pg5

[[Cephamycin]]
CATEGORIES: Cephalosporin antibiotics

Cephamycins are a group of beta-lactam antibiotics. They are very similar to cephalosporins, and the cephamycins are sometimes classified as cephalosporins.
Like cephalosporins, cephamycins are based upon the cephem nucleus. Unlike most cephalosporins, cephamycins are a very efficacious antibiotic against anaerobic microbes.
Cephamycins were originally produced by Streptomyces, but synthetic ones have been produced as well.
Cephamycins possess a methoxy group at the 7-alpha position.[tpl]cite book |author=Oreste A. Mascaretti |title=Bacteria Versus Antibacterial Agents: An Integrated Approach |publisher=American Society Microbiology |location= |year=2003 |pages=144  |isbn=1-55581-258-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
In addition, cephamycins have been shown to be stable against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms although their use in clinical practice is lacking for this indication.

Nancy Anna Francina Coolen, known as Nance (born September 10, 1973 in Asten, North Brabant, Netherlands) is a Dutch TV host who was previously the lead-singer of a Eurodance group called Twenty 4 Seven.
At the age of 15, Nance was discovered in a discothèque by dance-producer Ruud van Rijen. He created the dance-act Twenty 4 Seven, in which Nance performs along with rapper Tony Dawson-Harrison, more commonly known by his stage name, Captain Hollywood. When the latter left the project and was replaced by rapper Stay C the act scored its biggest hits, like Slave to the Music.
In 1996 Nance decided to leave Twenty 4 Seven to start up a solo-career, which led to a couple of small hits in The Netherlands. Around the same time she began working as a TV host for several channels. She hosted the Dutch Top 40 a couple of times for TMF Nederland. A little later she did the love quiz Liefde is... for RTL 5. In 1999 she started hosting the game show Rappatongo for Tros. After 200 episodes the show was cancelled. 
Nance started hosting the game show Lingo which she did until late 2005 when she decided to host programmes for SBS 6.
Nance was married to William Rutten from May 4, 1995 until March 2000, when they divorced. She now has a relationship with Pico van Sytzama.

Kennet Avenue or West Kennet Avenue is a prehistoric site in the English county of Wiltshire.
It was an avenue of two parallel lines of stones 25m wide and 2.5 km in length which ran between the Neolithic sites of Avebury and The Sanctuary. A second avenue, called Beckhampton Avenue led west from Avebury towards Beckhampton Long Barrow.
Excavations by Stuart Piggott and Alexander Keiller in the 1930s indicated that around 100 pairs of standing stones had lined the avenue and that they dated to around 2200 BC based on finds of Beaker burials found beneath some of the stones. Many stones have since fallen or are missing however.
Keiller and Piggott righted some of the fallen stones they excavated as did Maud Cunnington during her earlier work there. More recently the stones have been the subject of vandalism when red paint was thrown over some of them.
It is part of the Avebury World Heritage Site. West Kennet Avenue is in the freehold ownership of The National Trust and in English Heritage guardianship. It is managed by The National Trust on behalf of English Heritage, and the two organisations share the cost of managing and maintaining the property.http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/west-kennet-avenue/

CATEGORIES: 1894 novels, 1890s science fiction novels, American science fiction novels, Jupiter in fiction, Saturn in fiction, 2000 in fiction, D. Appleton & Company books

A Journey in Other Worlds: A Romance of the Future is a science fiction novel by John Jacob Astor IV, published in 1894.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America 1886–1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984; pp. 108-11. ISBN 0-8229-5413-3
The book offers a fictional account of life in the year 2000. It contains abundant speculation about technological invention, including descriptions of a worldwide telephone network, solar power, air travel, space travel to the planets Saturn and Jupiter, and terraforming engineering projects — damming the Arctic Ocean, and adjusting the Earth's axial tilt (by the Terrestrial Axis Straightening Company).
In Astor's novel, the  future United States is a multi-continental superpower. European nations have been taken over by socialist governments, which have sold most of their African colonies to the U.S.; and Canada, Mexico, and the countries of South America have requested annexation. Race conflict is a thing of the past, since the "dark elements" of the American hegemony have died out.
Space travel is achieved through apergy, an anti-gravitational energy force. Jupiter proves to be a jungle world, with flesh-eating plants, vampire bats, giant snakes and mastodons, and flying lizards. The Americans discover a wealth of exploitable resources: iron, silver, gold, lead, copper, coal, and oil.
Saturn, in contrast, is an ancient world of silent spirits. The spirit beings provide the explorers with foresight of their own deaths.

[[History of Poznań]]
CATEGORIES: History of Poznań

Poznań, today Poland's fifth largest city, is also one of the country's oldest cities, and was an important political and religious center in the early Polish state of the 10th century. Poznań Cathedral is the oldest church in the country, containing the tombs of the first Polish rulers, Duke Mieszko I and King Bolesław I Chrobry.
Although the centre of national political power moved to Kraków in the 11th century, and later to Warsaw, Poznań remained an important regional center, being the chief city of the Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) region. It came under Prussian (later German) rule for most of the period from 1793 to 1918, during which it expanded significantly, and was also heavily fortified (as Festung Posen). The city resumed its role as a Polish voivodeship capital in the Second Polish Republic, and later, following the 1939–1945 Nazi occupation, in the communist Polish People's Republic. Since 1999 Poznań has been the capital of Greater Poland Voivodeship.

The Pensioners' Party (Partito Pensionati, PP) is a centrist Italian political party. It was founded in 1987 in Milan and its current leader is Carlo Fatuzzo.
In the 2004 European Parliament election it gained 1.1% of the national vote and elected its leader to the European Parliament, where he sits in the European People's Party–European Democrats group.
On 4 February 2006, the party joined The Union, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi, and was decisive for the result of the 2006 general election (the PP scored 0.9% and the centre-left won by a 0.1% margin), but soon after the election the alliance with the centre-left turned to be cold and tense. In the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani (Forza Italia, Vice President of the European People's Party), tried successfully to convince Fatuzzo to return in the centre-right.
Finally, on 20 November 2006, Carlo Fatuzzo, in a press conference alongside with Antonio Tajani and Fabrizio Cicchitto (national deputy-coordinator of Forza Italia), announced that its party was re-joining the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition.
Ithe 2009 European Parliament election the party ran as part of The Autonomy, an electoral coalition inclunding also The Right, the Movement for Autonomies and the Alliance of the Centre.http://www.partitoladestra.com/?costante_pagina=polo_autonomia&id_lingua=2http://www.irispress.it/Iris/page.asp?VisImg=S&Art=33035&Cat=1&I=null&IdTipo=0&TitoloBlocco=Italia&Codi_Cate_Arti=18

[[Car phone]]
CATEGORIES: Automotive technologies, Mobile telecommunications user equipment

A car phone is a mobile phone device specifically designed for and fitted into an automobile.
This service originated with the Bell System, and was first used in St. Louis on June 17, 1946.  The original equipment weighed [tpl]convert|80|lb|kg[/tpl], and there were initially only 3 channels for all the users in the metropolitan area, later more licenses were added bringing the total to 32 channels across 3 bands (See IMTS frequencies). This service was used at least into the 1980s in large portions of North America.[ref] Regis J. Bates, Donald W. Gregory Voice & data communications handbook McGraw-Hill Professional, 2007 
ISBN 0-07-226335-0 page 193[/ref] On October 2, 1946, Motorola communications equipment carried the first calls on Illinois Bell Telephone Company's new car radiotelephone service in Chicago.Motorola First Car Radio TelephoneHistory of Car Telephones 1946-1953 Due to the small number of radio frequencies available, the service quickly reached capacity.
In the 1980s, the car phone was more popular than the regular mobile phone. However, since the mobile phone boom in the 1990s, when mobile phones became much more affordable, the car phone has suffered, as most people carry their mobile phone around with them, and the availability of hands free kits installed in many cars allow the driver to talk and listen to a call while driving.
In Finland, car phone service was first available in 1971 on the zero-generation ARP (Autoradiopuhelin, or Car Radiophone) service. This was succeeded in 1982 by the 1G system NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone), used across Scandinavia and in other often remote areas.
In North America, car phone
typically used the Mobile Telephone Service (MTS), which was first used in St. Louis, or Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) before giving way to analog cellular service (AMPS) in 1984.  AMPS technology was discontinued in the United States in 2008.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
Since a traditional car phone uses a high-power transmitter and external antenna, it is ideal for rural or undeveloped areas where mobile handsets may not work well or at all.  However, due to current US Federal Communications Commission regulations, carriers must pay penalties for activating any equipment that is not an E911 compliant device, such as analog.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

[[Bandstand]]
CATEGORIES: Music venues, Buildings and structures by type

A bandstand is a circular or semicircular structure set in a park, garden, pier, or indoor space, designed to accommodate musical bands performing concerts. A simple construction, it both creates an ornamental focal point and also serves acoustic requirements while providing shelter for the changeable weather, if outdoors.
Many bandstands in the United Kingdom originated in the Victorian era as the British brass band movement gained popularity. Smaller bandstands are often not much more than gazebos. Much larger bandstands such as that at the Hollywood Bowl may be called bandshells and usually take a shape similar to a quarter sphere. Though many bandstands fell into disuse and disrepair in the post-war period, the cultural project the Bandstand Marathon has seen bandstands across the U.K utilized for free live concerts since 2008.

Willem Hendrik van den Bos (25 September 1896, Rotterdam – 30 March 1974) was a Dutch-South African astronomer.  At least one source refers to him as Van der Bos, but this seems to be an error.
He initially worked at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, but came to Union Observatory in South Africa in 1925, becoming director in 1941.
He discovered thousands of double stars and recorded tens of thousands of micrometer measurements of such stars, calculating the orbits of a number of binary stars.
He was president of the Astronomical Society of South Africa in 1943 and 1955.
Some biographical sources say he discovered more than a hundred asteroids; however the Minor Planet Center does not credit him with any asteroid discoveries.
The asteroid 1663 van den Bos is named after him, as is the lunar crater van den Bos.

[[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)]]
CATEGORIES: Political history of Afghanistan, Provisional governments, Bonn, 2001 in Afghanistan

The Bonn Agreement (officially the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-Establishment of Permanent Government Institutions) was the initial series of agreements intended to re-create the State of Afghanistan following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since no nationally-agreed-upon government had existed in Afghanistan since 1979, it was felt necessary to have a transition period before a permanent government was established. A nationally-agreed-upon government would require at least one loya jirga to be convened; however, in the absence of law and order in the wake of the rapid victory of American and Afghan Northern Alliance forces, immediate steps were felt to be required.

Durkheim founded L'Année Sociologique as a way of publicizing his own research and the research of his students and other scholars working within his new sociological paradigm. As a result of this the term is also used to refer to the distinctive approach of this group and the work they produced in the first two decades of the twentieth century.
Members of the L'Année Sociologique group include Émile Durkheim, Célestin Bouglé, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert, Robert Hertz, Maurice Halbwachs, and François Simiand among others.

John Stefanos Paraskevopoulos (June 20, 1889 – March 15, 1961) was a Greek/South African astronomer. He was born in Piraeus, Greece and graduated from the University of Athens.  He served in the Greek army during the Balkan Wars and World War I. In 1919, he went to America for two years, spending part of that time working at Yerkes Observatory where he met and married Dorothy W. Block. In 1921, he returned to Athens where he became head of the Athens Observatory.  He left this post due to a lack of funding and went to Arequipa, Peru to work at Boyden Station, a branch of Harvard Observatory, with a view to finding a more suitable location for it. The decision was made to move Boyden Station to South Africa due to better weather conditions, and Paraskevopoulos served there as director of Boyden Observatory in South Africa from 1927 to 1951. He co-discovered a couple of comets. The  crater Paraskevopoulos on the Moon is named after him.

Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock (or Fok; [tpl]lang-ru|Влади́мир Алекса́ндрович Фoк[/tpl]) (December 22, 1898 – December 27, 1974) was a Soviet physicist, who did foundational work on quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. 
He was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1922 he graduated from Petrograd University, then continued postgraduate studies there. He became a professor there in 1932. In 1919–1923 and 1928–1941 he collaborated with the Vavilov State Optical Institute, in 1924–1936 with the Leningrad Institute of Physics and Technology, in 1934–1941 and 1944–1953 with the Lebedev Physical Institute.
His primary scientific contribution lies in the development of quantum physics, although he also contributed significantly to the fields of mechanics, theoretical optics, theory of gravitation, physics of continuous media. In 1926 he derived the Klein–Gordon equation. He gave his name to Fock space, the Fock representation and Fock state, and developed the Hartree–Fock method in 1930. He made many subsequent scientific contributions, during the rest of his life. Fock developed the electromagnetic methods for geophysical exploration in a book The theory of the study of the rocks resistance by the carottage method (1933); the methods are called the well logging in modern literature.
Fock made significant contributions to general relativity theory, specifically for the many body problems. 
In Leningrad, Fock created a scientific school in theoretical physics and raised the physics education in the USSR through his books. He wrote the first textbook on quantum mechanics Foundations of quantum mechanics (1931) and a very influential monograph The theory of space, time and gravitation (1955).
Historians of science, such as Loren Graham, see Fock as a representative and proponent of Einstein's theory of relativity within the Soviet world. At a time when most Marxist philosophers objected to relativity theory, Fock emphasized a materialistic understanding of relativity that coincided philosophically with Marxism. 
He was a full member (academician) of the USSR Academy of Sciences (1939) and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

[[10 August (French Revolution)]]

CATEGORIES: 1792 events of the French Revolution, Military coups in France

On 10 August 1792, during the French Revolution, revolutionary Fédéré militias — with the backing of a new municipal government of Paris that came to be known as the "insurrectionary" Paris Commune and ultimately supported by the National Guard — besieged the Tuileries palace. King Louis XVI and the royal family took shelter with the Legislative Assembly. This proved to be the effective end of the French Bourbon Monarchy (until it was restored in 1814, although the monarchical system of an empire had been introduced ten years earlier). The formal end of the monarchy occurred six weeks later, as one of the first acts of business of the new Convention.
This insurrection and its outcome are most commonly referred to by historians of the Revolution simply as "the 10 August"; other common designations include "the ''journée'' of the 10 August" ([tpl]lang-fr|journée du 10 août[/tpl]), "the insurrection of the 10 August", or even "the revolution of the 10 August".

Aloysius Viktor Stepinac ([tpl]lang-hr|Alojzije Viktor Stepinac[/tpl], 8 May 1898 –10 February 1960) was a Croatian Catholic cardinal and Archbishop of Zagreb from 1937 to 1960. In 1998 he was declared a martyr and beatified by Pope John Paul II.
Stepinac was ordained on October 26, 1930 by archbishop Giuseppe Palica, and in 1931 he became a parish curate in Zagreb. He established the archdiocesan branch of Caritas in 1931, and was appointed coadjutor to the see of Zagreb in 1934. When Archbishop Anton Bauer died on December 7, 1937, Stepinac succeeded him as the Archbishop of Zagreb.[tpl]cite book| last = Bunson| first = Matthew and Margaret | authorlink = | title = John Paul II's book of saints | publisher = Our Sunday Visitor Publishing |isbn=978-0-87973-934-8 | pages = 90–92 | year = 1999 | series = |url=http://books.google.hr/books?id=RH-GGO2aLoUC&pg=PA90&dq=Aloysius+Stepinac#v=onepage&q=Aloysius%20Stepinac&f=false |accessdate= 28 February 2011[/tpl] During World War II, on 6 April 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany, who established the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia (Croatian: Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH).

After the war he publicly condemned the new Yugoslav government and its actions during World War II, especially for murders of priests by Communist militants. Yugoslav authorities indicted the archbishop on multiple counts of war crimes and collaboration with the enemy during wartime.

In a verdict that polarized public opinion both in Yugoslavia and beyond, the Yugoslav authorities found him guilty of collaboration with the fascist Ustaše movement and complicity in allowing the forced conversions of Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism.[tpl]cite book|title= The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930-1965|last=Phayer|first=Michael|year=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-21471-3[/tpl]
After foreign and domestic pressure, Stepinac was released from Lepoglava prison. In 1952 he was appointed cardinal by Pope Pius XII. Stepinac died while still under confinement in his parish, possibly as the result of poisoning by his Communist captors. In October 3, 1998, Pope John Paul II declared him a martyr and beatified him before 500,000 Croatians in Marija Bistrica near Zagreb.

[[Henry II of Jerusalem]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic monarchs, 1270 births, 1324 deaths, Kings of Jerusalem, Kings of Cyprus, Claimant Kings of Jerusalem, Medieval child rulers

Henry II of Jerusalem and Henry II of Cyprus, born Henri de Lusignan (June 1270 – 31 MarchCharles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Cyprus 1324) was the last ruling and first titular King of Jerusalem (after the fall of Acre on 28 May 1291, this title became titular) and also ruled as King of Cyprus as Henry II. He was a Lusignan dynast.
He was the second surviving son of Hugh III and succeeded his brother John I on 20 May 1285; there was some suspicion that Henry had been involved in poisoning John. He was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, 24 June 1285. Charles of Anjou, who contested John's claim to the throne, had died in 1285, allowing Henry to recover Acre from the Angevins. With a fleet Henry attacked Acre, defended by Charles' lieutenant Hugh Pelerin, and the city was captured on 29 July. Henry had himself crowned King of Jerusalem there on 15 August 1286, but returned to Cyprus and appointed his uncle Philip of Ibelin as Bailiff in his absence. By this time Acre was one of the few coastal cities remaining in the remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. During his reign the Mameluks captured Tyre, Beirut, and the rest of the cities, and destroyed the similarly weakened County of Tripoli in 1289. The final siege of Acre began on 5 April 1291 with Henry present in the city. He escaped to Cyprus with most of his nobles, and the city fell to Khalil on 28 May.
Henry continued to rule as King of Cyprus, and continued to claim the kingdom of Jerusalem as well, often planning to recover the former territory on the mainland. He attempted a coordinated military operation in 1299/1300 with Ghazan, the Mongol ilkhan of Persia, when Ghazan invaded Mameluk territory in 1299 (see Franco-Mongol alliance); he tried to stop Genoese ships from trading with the Mameluks, hoping to weaken them economically; and he twice wrote to Pope Clement V asking for a new crusade. His reign in Cyprus was prosperous and wealthy, and he was very much involved with the justice and administration of the kingdom — he had the Haute Cour keep written records for the first time (in Italian or French, rather than Latin), and extended the court's role from a feudal advisory body to a true court responsible for trying and punishing criminals. However, Cyprus was in no position to fulfill his true ambition, the recovery of the Holy Land. He suffered from epilepsy, which at times incapacitated him, and his nobles were unsatisfied with him. He had his brother Guy, the Constable of Cyprus, put to death in 1303 for conspiring against him. In 1306 his brother Amalric, Prince of Tyre, Constable of Jerusalem, conspired with the Templars to remove him from power. However, Amalric assumed the title of Governor and Regent of Cyprus, rather than of King. Henry was deposed on 26 April and exiled to Armenia, where King Oshin of Armenia was Amalric's brother-in-law. However, upon the murder of Amalric in 1310, Oshin released Henry, who returned to Cyprus and resumed his throne with the aid of the Hospitallers on 26 August 1310, imprisoning many of Amalric's co-conspirators, including their brother Constable Aimery, brother-in-law Balian II of Ibelin, Prince of Galilee, and other relatives of Balian. In 1313, he oversaw the dissolution of the Templars in Cyprus and the transfer of their property to the Hospitallers.
He married Constanza of Sicily (1303/1307 – in Cyprus after 19 June 1344), daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, on 16 October 1317 but they didn't have any children. She later married Leon V of Armenia and Jean de Lusignan, Titular Prince of Antioch.
Henry died on 31 March 1324 at his Villa in Strovolos, near Nicosia, was buried at the Franciscan Church of Nicosia and was succeeded by his nephew Hugh IV.

[tpl]nihongo|Scrapped Princess|スクラップド・プリンセス|Sukurappudo Purinsesu[/tpl] is a Japanese light novel series by Ichiro Sakaki and illustrated by Yukinobu Azumi, also known as the popular adult dōjin artist Nakayohi Mogudan. In 2003, it was adapted into an anime series produced by Bones. The character designs in the anime are by Takahiro Komori, who is also known for the designs on another anime series, Cowboy Bebop.
Scrapped Princess is notable for high quality animation,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] its music, which is composed by Masumi Itō, and its themes.  It begins as high fantasy and then quickly mixes into varying degrees of post-apocalyptic and science fiction elements through the application of Clarke's third law. The atmosphere has undertones of sadness, though many of the characters and situations are superficially light-hearted.
The anime is distributed in the United States by Bandai Entertainment. There is also a manga adaptation which has also been published in the US by Tokyopop. The manga is only three volumes, and has no plot overlap with the anime; the only things in common are the three main characters, the idea of the Scrapped Princess, and the Mauser Faith they are running from.  Between May and November 2007 three of the original light novels have been translated into English by Tokyopop.

[[Gooey butter cake]]

CATEGORIES: American desserts, Cakes, Cuisine of St. Louis, Missouri, Cuisine of the Midwestern United States, Foods featuring butter

Gooey butter cake is a type of cake traditionally made in the American Midwest city of St. Louis. Gooey butter cake is a flat and dense cake made with wheat cake flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, typically near an inch tall, and dusted with powdered sugar. While sweet and rich, it is somewhat firm, and is able to be cut into pieces similarly to a brownie. Gooey butter cake is generally served as a type of coffee cake and not as a formal dessert cake. There are two distinct variants of the gooey butter: a bakers' gooey butter and a cream cheese and commercial yellow cake mix variant. It is believed to have originated in the 1930s.History of Gooey Butter Cake
The St. Louis Convention & Visitors Commission includes a recipe for the cake on its website, calling it "one of St. Louis' popular, quirky foods"; the recipe calls for a bottom layer of butter and yellow cake batter, and a top layer made from eggs, cream cheese, and, in one case, almond extract. The cake is dusted with confectioner's sugar before being served. The cake is best eaten soon after baking it. It should be served at room temperature or warm.[tpl]cite web|title=Ooey Gooey Butter Cake|url=http://www.thesweetart.com/2011/06/ooey-gooey-butter-cake.html|work=The Sweet Art|accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl]
The cream cheese variant of the gooey butter cake recipe, while close enough to the original, is an approximation designed for easier preparation at home. Almost all bakeries in the greater St. Louis area, including those at local grocery chains Schnucks and Dierbergs, use a slightly different recipe based on corn syrup, sugar and powdered eggs—no cake mix or cream cheese is involved [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl].

Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (February 21, 1816 – January 31, 1895) was an influential  American politician, lawyer, and justice from Massachusetts. He was appointed U.S. Attorney General in 1869 by President Ulysses S. Grant; he became the first U.S. Attorney General to head the newly created Department of Justice in July, 1870. As Attorney General Hoar worked with President Ulysses S. Grant and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish over contentious issues as settling the Alabama Claims with England and in keeping the U.S. from recognizing Cuban belligerency during the Ten Years War.  Hoar assisted Grant in appointing two Supreme Court justices that helped overturn a decision outlawing paper money as legal tender.  Hoar himself, nominated by President Grant, was rejected by the Senate to fill a Supreme Court vacancy,  in part due to Senators' dismay over Hoar's resistance to distribute federal patronage jobs without regard to the job  applicant's cababilities.
Hoar's position on Grant's Cabinet was tenuous, since two Cabinet members, Secretary of the Treasury, George S. Boutwell and Hoar, were from Massachusetts, during an era when regionally-balanced cabinets were an expected norm by members of the  U.S. Senate.  In June 1870 Hoar was asked to resign by President Grant;  Hoar's unexpected resignation became controversial when his resignation letter to Grant was printed by news journals. Hoar departed from office  in November 1870, upon the confirmation of  Amos T. Akerman from Georgia. 
Hoar came from a prominent Puritan family that had settled in Massachusetts in 1640. An exceptionally bright student from his youth, Hoar attended Harvard College starting in 1831 and graduated in 1835. After teaching and traveling in the West, Hoar returned to Concord and studied law, passing the bar in 1839. In 1846, Hoar was elected as a Whig to the Massachusetts State Senate. From 1849 to 1855 Hoar served on the Massachusetts court of common pleas. In 1859 Hoar was appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, serving until his appointment as U.S. Attorney General in 1869. After serving as U.S. Attorney General, Hoar served on a joint high commission between the U.S. and the United Kingdom which negotiated the Treaty of Washington (1871), which created an arbitration tribunal to settle the Alabama Claims against the United Kingdom, and created an arbitration process to settle other trade, territorial and maritime issues with the Dominion of Canada. 
Hoar was a member of the Harvard College Board of Overseers from 1868 to 1882. In 1872 Hoar was elected as a Republican to the Forty-third Congress, serving from 1873 to 1875. After his term as Congressman ended Hoar returned to his law practice in Concord and Boston, Massachusetts, working until his death in 1895.

Brigadier General George Miller Sternberg (June 8, 1838 – November 3, 1915) was a U.S. Army physician who is considered the first U.S. bacteriologist, having written Manual of Bacteriology (1892). After he survived typhoid and yellow fever, Sternberg documented the cause of malaria (1881), discovered the cause of lobar pneumonia (1881), and confirmed the roles of the bacilli of tuberculosis and typhoid fever (1886).
As the 18th U.S. Army Surgeon General, from 1893 to 1902, Sternberg led commissions to control typhoid and yellow fever, along with his subordinate Major Walter Reed. Sternberg also oversaw the establishment of the  Army Medical School (1893; now the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) and of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps (1901). The pioneering German bacteriologist Robert Koch honored Sternberg with the sobriquet, "Father of American Bacteriology".

John Batterson Stetson (May 5, 1830 - February 18, 1906) was a U.S. hatter,  hat manufacturer, and, in the 1860s, the inventor of the cowboy hat. He founded the John B. Stetson Company as a manufacturer of headwear; the company's hats are now commonly referred to simply as Stetsons.
John Stetson was born in New Jersey, the 7th of 12 children. His father, Stephen Stetson, was a hatter. As a youth, John Stetson worked with his father until John was diagnosed with tuberculosis and his doctor predicted he had only a short time to live. Given this dire prognosis, he left the hat-making business to explore the American West, afraid this would be his only chance to see it.Kristin Palm.

The former hat-maker turned a critical eye to the flea-infested coonskin caps favored by many of the gold seekers, and wondered whether fur-felt would work for a lightweight, all-weather hat suitable for the West.Flanagan, Mike  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Old West (1999) p. 239 ISBN 0-02-862945-0

Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.
Micrography is also a classic feature in Parkinson's disease.

During the feudal division of Poland it was split off with the Duchy of Racibórz in 1281 and ruled by Silesian dukes from the Piast dynasty since 1290.Panic 2002, 6. 
The ducal lands initially comprised former Lesser Polish territories east of the Biała River, which about 1315 split off again as the Duchy of Oświęcim, while the remaining duchy became a Bohemian fief in 1327. After the bulk of Silesia was conquered by the Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1742, Cieszyn/Teschen together with the duchies of Troppau (Opava), Krnov and Nysa remained with Austrian Silesia. The ducal title was held by the Austrian archdukes from the House of Lorraine until 1918.

The Renault Alliance is a subcompact automobile manufactured and marketed in North America by American Motors Corporation (AMC) for model years 1983-1987. It was available in two and four-door sedan configurations with a convertible added in 1985. The Alliance was also the basis of the three or five-door hatchback Renault Encore that was added in 1984. AMC also marketed a sports version called Renault GTA for 1987.  A total of 623,573 vehicles were manufactured in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Production was discontinued after the acquisition of AMC by Chrysler in 1987.
The Alliance and Encore derived from AMC's partnership since 1979 with Renault, which held controlling stake in the smallest U.S. automaker. The Alliance and Encore were essentially the Renault 9 & 11 re-engineered for the U.S. and Canadian markets. The cars featured exterior styling by Robert Opron, director of Renault Styling.[tpl]cite book |page=544 |title=The Design Encyclopedia |first=Mel |last=Byars |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |year=2004|isbn=978-0-87070-012-5 [/tpl] The interior design was by AMC's Richard Teague and the Alliance two-door sedan and the convertible were unique models developed by AMC.

Statelessness is a legal concept describing the lack of any nationality. It denotes the absence of a recognized link between an individual and any state.
A de jure stateless person is someone who is "not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law".[tpl]cite web|title=Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, article 1(1)|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/415c3cfb4.html[/tpl]

Dabo (ダボ Dabo) is a Japanese rapper. He first appeared on the Japanese hip-hop scene in the 1990s, collaborating in a Shakkazombie song, "Tomo ni ikkou". Since 2002, he has released three albums: Hitman (2002), Diamond (2003), and The Force (2006).  Dabo's lyrics are more hard-edged than most J-pop, or Japanese pop, and represent a tough Japanese street culture.Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization.

[[Subcontractor]]
CATEGORIES: Contract law, Construction trades workers

A subcontractor is an individual or in many cases a business that signs a contract to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.
A subcontractor is a person who is hired by a general contractor (or prime contractor, or main contractor) to perform a specific task as part of the overall project and is normally paid for services provided to the project by the originating general contractor. While the most common concept of a subcontractor is in building works and civil engineering, the range of opportunities for subcontractor is much wider and it is possible that the greatest number now operate in the information technology and information sectors of business.
The incentive to hire subcontractors is either to reduce costs or to mitigate project risks. In this way the general contractor receives the same or better service than the general contractor could have provided by itself, at lower overall risk. Many subcontractors do work for the same companies rather than different ones. This allows subcontractors to further specialize their skills.
In the United Kingdom economy, the need to respond to a rapidly changing environment and service a diverse infrastructure has encouraged flexibility and diversity in its subcontractor community with the majority of subcontractors now providing specialised skills to a wide range of companies.

CATEGORIES: Hawaii law

Kānāwai Māmalahoe, or Law of the Splintered Paddle (also translated Law of the Splintered Oar), is a precept in Hawaiian law, originating with King Kamehameha I in 1797. The law, "Let every elderly person, woman and child lie by the roadside in safety," is enshrined in the state constitution, Article 9, Section 10, and has become a model for modern human rights law regarding the treatment of civilians and other non-combatants.The Law of the Splintered Paddle: Kānāwai Māmalahoe. (PDF). hawaii.edu  It was created when Kamehameha was on a military expedition in Puna.  His party encountered a group of commoners on a beach.  While chasing two fishermen who had stayed behind to cover the retreat of a man carrying a child, Kamehameha's leg was caught in the reef. One of the fisherman, Kaleleiki, hit him mightily on the head with a paddle in defense, which broke into pieces.  Kamehameha could have been killed at that point but the fisherman spared him. Years later, the same fisherman was brought before Kamehameha.  Instead of ordering for him to be killed, Kamehameha ruled that the fisherman had only been protecting his land and family, and so the Law of the Splintered Paddle was declared.Hawaiian Historical Legends: XVII.

[[Mastication]]
CATEGORIES: Dentistry, Digestive system

Mastication or chewing is the process by which food is crushed and ground by teeth. It is the first step of digestion and it increases the surface area of foods to allow more efficient break down by enzymes. During the mastication process, the food is positioned between the teeth for grinding by the cheek and tongue. As chewing continues, the food is made softer and warmer, and the enzymes in saliva begin to break down carbohydrates in the food. After chewing, the food (now called a bolus) is swallowed. It enters the oesophagus and via peristalsis continues on to the stomach, where the next step of digestion occurs.[tpl]cite web|title=Prehension, Mastication and Swallowing|url=http://biology.about.com/library/organs/blpathodigest4.htm[/tpl]
Premastication is sometimes performed by human parents for young infants who are unable to do so for themselves. The food is masticated in the mouth of the parent into a bolus and then transferred to the infant for consumption.[tpl]citation|first=Wendy |last=Holmes |title=Influences on maternal and child nutrition in the highlands of the northern Lao PDR |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |year=2007 |volume=16 |number=3 |pages=537–545|pmid=17704036[/tpl]
Cattle and some other animals, called ruminants, chew food more than once to extract more nutrients. After the first round of chewing, this food is called cud.

[[Humboldt Current]]
CATEGORIES: Marine ecoregions, Ocean currents, Fisheries science, Environment of Peru, Climate of Chile

The Humboldt Current is a cold, low-salinity ocean current that flows north along the west coast of South America from the southern tip of Chile to northern Peru. Also called the Peru Current, it is an eastern boundary current flowing in the direction of the equator, and can extend 1,000 kilometers offshore.  The Humboldt Current Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), named after the Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, is one of the major upwelling systems of the world, supporting an extraordinary abundance of marine life.  Upwelling occurs off Peru year-round but off Chile only during the spring and summer, because of the displacement of the subtropical center of high pressure during the summer.
The Humboldt Current LME is considered a Class I, highly productive (>300 gC/m2-yr), ecosystem. It is the most productive marine ecosystem in the world, as well as the largest upwelling system.  The Humboldt’s high rates of primary and secondary productivity support the world’s largest fisheries.  Approximately 18-20% of the world’s fish catch comes from the Humboldt Current LME. The species are mostly pelagic: sardines, anchovies and jack mackerel. The LME’s high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals. The cold, nutrient-rich water brought to the surface by upwelling drives the system’s extraordinary productivity.
Periodically, the upwelling that drives the system’s productivity is disrupted by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event.  When this occurs, fish abundance and distribution are significantly affected, often leading to stock crashes and cascading social and economic impacts.  These events have led to sequential changes, where sardines and anchovies have replaced each other periodically as the dominant species in the ecosystem.  These species changes can have negative consequences for the fishing industry and the economies of the countries that fish the system.
The Humboldt has a considerable cooling influence on the climate of Chile, Peru and Ecuador. It is also largely responsible for the aridity of Atacama Desert in northern Chile and coastal areas of Peru and also of the aridity of southern Ecuador. Marine air is cooled by the current and thus is not conducive to generating precipitation (although clouds and fog are produced).

Orkut Büyükkökten (born February 6, 1975) is a Turkish software engineer who developed the social networking services Club Nexus, inCircle and Orkut.
Originally from Konya, Turkey, Büyükkökten obtained a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering and Information Science from Bilkent University in Ankara. He received both a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University. His research at Stanford focused on Web search and efficient PDA usage.
Orkut has been building and working on online communities since 2000. He introduced his first social network, named Club Nexus[tpl]cite web | title=A social network caught in the Web | date=2003-06-02 | url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/53501/Orkut-A-Social-Network-Caught-in-the-Web | work=First Monday[/tpl] at Stanford in the fall of 2001.

Students could use Club Nexus to send e-mail and invitations, chat, post events, buy and sell used goods, search for people with similar interests, place personals, display their artwork or post editorial columns. Within a few months of its introduction, Club Nexus attracted over 2,000 undergraduates.
Later, Orkut introduced an alumni social network, named inCircle for the Stanford Alumni Association intended for use by university alumni groups.
After joining Google, Orkut decided to use his 20% time to develop a social network. He said: "My dream was to connect all the Internet users so they can relate to each other, it can make such a difference in people's lives." The product manager and Marissa Mayer thought of naming the service after its creator. "Orkut.com" belonged to Orkut Büyükkökten himself. Google convinced him, and its social networking service was called Orkut.[tpl]cite book | title=In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/In_the_Plex.html?id=V1u1f8sv3k8C | author=Steven Levy | date=2011-04-12[/tpl]

The Met Center was an indoor arena that stood in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The arena, which was completed in 1967 just to the north of Metropolitan Stadium, seated 15,000. It was best known as the home of the Minnesota North Stars of the NHL from 1967-1993. For its first 15 years, its official name was the Metropolitan Sports Center; the more familiar shorter name was adopted in 1982.
The Met's other tenants included the ABA's Minnesota Muskies, which played just one season before moving to Miami. They were replaced by the Minnesota Pipers, who also played only one season. The NASL's Minnesota Kicks played two indoor seasons at the Met from 1979 to 1981.  The MISL's Minnesota Strikers played indoor soccer at the Met Center from 1984-1988. The Boys' High School Hockey Tournament was also held there 1969-1975.  
The arena also held entertainment-related shows, including the very first performance of Sesame Street Live in September 1980.
The Met Center was considered to be one of the finest arenas in the NHL for many years, both for its sightlines, and its ice surface. Among NHL players, the Met was known for fast ice, the best lighting, great locker rooms and training facilities. The Met never boasted fancy amenities, and by comparison to modern arenas it had cramped concourses, no luxury suites, and very few frills. As a sports facility, it could best be described as utilitarian, a theme which repeats itself in most Minnesota sports facilities built before 1988 (such as the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome). 
After the North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas in 1993 and became the Dallas Stars, the Met Center was demolished on December 13, 1994 in a series of three controlled implosions.  The NHL returned to Minnesota in 2000 when the expansion Minnesota Wild began play at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.
For several years after the arena was demolished, the property served as an overflow lot for the Mall of America. In 2004, an IKEA store opened on the west end of the property, and the new American Boulevard was rerouted through the east end of the property.  The remainder of the site is planned long-term to become the site of Mall of America Phase II, of which the IKEA would be an anchor store.

[[Virginia dynasty]]
CATEGORIES: History of Virginia, United States presidential history

The Virginia dynasty is a term sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the first five Presidents of the United States were from Virginia.  The term sometimes excludes George Washington, who, though a Virginia planter, was closely aligned with the policies of the Federalist Party, and was succeeded by his Vice President, John Adams of Massachusetts.  The first five presidents were, in order, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe.  
The defeat of Adams in 1800 by his Vice President, Thomas Jefferson, who had previously served as Washington's Secretary of State, marked the true beginning of the Virginia Dynasty, which is usually associated with what is now called the Democratic-Republican Party, although it was generally referred to as simply the "Republican" or "Jeffersonian" Party at the time.  Jefferson served two terms before retiring, in the Washingtonian precedent, in favor of his Secretary of State, fellow Virginian James Madison, the so-called "Father of the Constitution."  Although the War of 1812 greatly weakened Madison's popularity in the Northeast, especially in New England which consequently discussed secession, he was nonetheless re-elected rather easily in 1812 and was able to assist another Virginian who had remained loyal to him and the party, James Monroe, to be elected President in 1816.  
By the end of Monroe's first term the Federalist Party had essentially disbanded and Monroe was re-elected in 1820 without any real opposition, receiving every electoral vote except one, which went for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams. (Much later a myth arose that the dissenting elector had done so in order that George Washington would be the only president in American history to be elected unanimously.)[tpl]Cite journal |title=The Electoral Vote against Monroe in 1820-An American Legend |first=Lynn W. |last=Turner |work=The Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=42 |number=2 |date=September 1955 |pages=250–273 |publisher=Organization of American Historians |jstor=1897643[/tpl]
Monroe's second term marked the end of the Virginia Dynasty.  In the election of 1824, supporters of William H. Crawford portrayed him as "the rightful and legitimate successor of the Virginia Dynasty,"Lenner, Andrew C. (2001), "The Federal Principle in American Politics, 1790-1833." Rowman & Littlefield, p.152.  ISBN 0-7425-2071-4. but the Democratic-Republican Party splintered.  John Quincy Adams won the disputed 1824 election over General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, then considered to be part of the Southwest.  
After having contributed four of the first five Presidents and their having held office for thirty-two of the first thirty-six years of the constitution, to date four more Virginians have served as President.  They are William Henry Harrison, Virginia-born but elected as a resident of Ohio; John Tyler, who was elected Vice President in 1840 as Harrison's running mate, but wound up serving all but the first month of the latter's term after Harrison became the first President to die in office; Zachary Taylor, who made his name as a Kentucky resident; and Woodrow Wilson, who was a Virginia native but was elected President after serving as the president of Princeton University and Governor of New Jersey.

[[Independent contractor]]
CATEGORIES: Agency law, Business law, Employment classifications, Recruitment

An independent contractor is a natural person, business, or corporation that provides goods or services to another entity under terms specified in a contract or within a verbal agreement. Unlike an employee, an independent contractor does not work regularly for an employer but works as and when required, during which time he or she may be subject to law of agency. Independent contractors are usually paid on a freelance basis.  Contractors often work through a limited company or franchise, which they themselves own, or may work through an umbrella company. 
In the United States, any company or organization engaged in a trade or business that pays more than $600 to an independent contractor in one year is required to report this to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as well as to the contractor, using Form 1099-MISC.See generally [tpl]usc|26|6041[/tpl] and 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6041-1.Sample form 1099-MISC http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf  This form is merely a report of the money paid; independent contractors do not have income taxes withheld from their pay as regular employees do.

[[Composite bow]]
CATEGORIES: Bows (archery)

A composite bow is a traditional bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, cf., laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the back of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made similar to that of all-wood "self" bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, a composite bow requires more different materials than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.
Composite bows have been known from archaeology and art since the second millennium BCE, but their history is not well recorded as they were developed by cultures without a written tradition. They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities, classically for mounted archery although they can also be used on foot. Such bows spread among the military (and hunters) of civilizations that came into contact with nomad tribes; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa, and southwards in the Arabian peninsula and in India.
The details of manufacture varied between the various cultures that used them. Initially the tips of the limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, siyahs, made as an integral part of the wooden core of the bow.
Like other bows, they lost importance with the introduction and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (shooting for distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made of fiberglass.

Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy is a 1909 five minute silent film directed by J. Stuart Blackton based on an earlier musical starring Lillian Russell.
In the film, a smoker (Paul Panzer) falls asleep and is visited by two fairies (one of which is played by Gladys Hulette). Audiences marveled at the primitive special effects featuring the fairies interacting with objects much larger than themselves.
Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy was the first instance of tobacco product placement (for Sweet Corporal cigarettes and cigars) in the movies.
In 2003, the Library of Congress deemed it "significant" and preserved it in the National Film Registry.

[[Spengler Cup]]
CATEGORIES: Spengler Cup, Sport in Davos

The Spengler Cup is an annual ice hockey tournament held in Davos, Switzerland. First held in 1923, the Spengler Cup is often cited as the oldest invitational ice hockey tournament in the world. The event is hosted by the Swiss team HC Davos and played each year in Davos, Switzerland, between Christmas (December 25) and New Year's Day. Currently, all games are held at Vaillant Arena.
It was originally devised by Dr. Carl Spengler as a means to promote teams from German-speaking Europe, who might have suffered ostracism in the aftermath of World War I. Eventually, the tournament grew well beyond expectations. Many of Europe's most prestigious clubs and national programs have appeared, including Soviet, Swedish, Czechoslovak and German powerhouses.
Among non-European organizations, Team Canada, Team USA, nationally ranked NCAA schools, reigning AHL Calder Cup and Ontario Hockey Association champions, and even Team Japan (in 1971 as hosts of the upcoming Sapporo Winter Olympics) have traveled to Davos through the years.
The 2013 Spengler Cup marked the return of a North American league team, the AHL's Rochester Americans, who also were the last such team to take part in 1996.
The most recent Spengler Cup champion is Genève-Servette HC who beat HC CSKA Moscow 5-3 in the final.
The Spengler Cup is broadcast on Schweizer Fernsehen in Switzerland, on Eurosport 2 in most of Europe, on RTR Sport in Russia, on Nova Sport in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and on TSN and RDS in Canada.

CATEGORIES: Arcade system boards

The Atomiswave is a custom arcade system board and cabinet from Sammy Corporation. It is based on Sega's NAOMI system board (thus it's common to see the "Sega" logo on its boot up screen). The Atomiswave uses interchangeable game cartridges and the cabinet's control panel can be easily switched out with different control sets, including dual joysticks, dual lightguns and a steering wheel.
With the retirement of the aging Neo Geo MVS system, SNK Playmore chose the Atomiswave as its next system to develop games for. In a contract with Sammy, SNK Playmore agreed to develop five games for the Atomiswave system. Metal Slug 6 was SNK Playmore's fifth game for the Atomiswave, after which SNK moved on to a Taito Type X2 arcade board.

A lapdog or lap dog is a dog that is both small enough to be held in the arms or lie comfortably on a person's lap and temperamentally predisposed to do so. Lapdogs are not a specific breed, but is a generic term for a type of dog of small size and friendly disposition.
Lapdogs historically were kept in many societies around the world by individuals with leisure time, as docile companion animals with no working function. Genetic analysis reveals that lapdogs are among the earliest specific types of dogs to live with people. Today, most lapdog breeds fall into the Toy breed group.

[[Centimetre of water]]

CATEGORIES: Units of pressure

A centimetre of water (US spelling centimeter of water, abbreviated cmH2O or cm H2O) is a less commonly used unit of pressure derived from pressure head calculations using metrology. It is frequently used to measure the central venous pressure, the intracranial pressure while sampling cerebrospinal fluid, as well as determining pressures during mechanical ventilation or in water supply networks (then usually in metres water column).  It is also a common unit of pressure in the speech sciences.
It is defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water of 1 cm in height at 4 °C (temperature of maximum density) at the standard acceleration of gravity. That is [tpl]nowrap|999.9720 kg/m3 @ 4 °C[/tpl] × [tpl]nowrap|9.80665 m/s2[/tpl] / 100 = [tpl]nowrap|1 cmH2O (4°C)[/tpl] = [tpl]nowrap|98.0638 Pa[/tpl]. Using the approximation [tpl]nowrap|1000 kg/m³[/tpl] instead results in [tpl]nowrap|98.0665 Pa[/tpl].
This unit is commonly used to specify the pressure to which a CPAP machine is set after a polysomnogram.

The Hartford Convention was a series of meetings from December 15, 1814–January 5, 1815 in Hartford, Connecticut, United States, in which New England Federalists met to discuss their grievances concerning the ongoing War of 1812 and the political problems arising from the federal government's increasing power. Despite radical outcries among Federalists for New England secession and a separate peace with Great Britain, moderates outnumbered them and extreme proposals were not a major focus of the debate.Hickey (1997) p. 233
The convention discussed removing the three-fifths compromise which gave slave states more power in Congress and requiring a two-thirds super majority in Congress for the admission of new states, declarations of war, and laws restricting trade. The Federalists also discussed their grievances with the Louisiana Purchase and the Embargo of 1807. However, weeks after the convention's end, news of Major General Andrew Jackson's overwhelming victory in New Orleans swept over the Northeast, discrediting and disgracing the Federalists, resulting in their elimination as a major national political force.

The Talbot Tagora is an executive car developed by Chrysler Europe and produced by Peugeot Société Anonyme (PSA). The Tagora was marketed under the Talbot marque after PSA took over Chrysler's European operations in 1979. PSA presented the first production vehicle in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981. The Tagora fell short of sales expectations, described as a "showroom flop" just a year after its launch,[tpl]cite journal |journal=Car |date=December 1981 |page=p. 79[/tpl] and PSA cancelled the model two years later. Fewer than 20,000 Tagora models were built, all of them at the former Simca factory in Poissy, near Paris, France. Despite its reputation as a "duffer", the car has acquired a cult following.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=4270 |title=TALBOT Tagora [tpl]![/tpl] Car Specs |work=Octane |accessdate=18 May 2013[/tpl]

[[Performance bond]]
CATEGORIES: Bonds (finance)

A performance bond is a surety bond issued by an insurance company or a bank to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a contractor. 
A job requiring a payment & performance bond will usually require a bid bond, to bid the job.  When the job is awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion.
For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued in favor of a client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the contract (most often due to the bankruptcy of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond.    
Performance bonds are commonly used in the construction and development of real property,[tpl]cite web |url=http://swiftbonds.com/types-bonds/performance-bond/ |title=Performance bonds |accessdate=2014-01-27 |publisher=Swiftbonds[/tpl]  where an owner or investor may require the developer to assure that contractors or project managers procure such bonds in order to guarantee that the value of the work will not be lost in the case of an unfortunate event (such as insolvency of the contractor).  In other cases, a performance bond may be requested to be issued in other large contracts besides civil construction projects.
The term is also used to denote a collateral deposit of "good faith money",[tpl]Cite web | title = Good Faith Money | url=http://investopedia.com/terms/g/goodfaithmoney.asp | accessdate = December 4, 2006 | postscript =  [/tpl] intended to secure a futures contract, commonly known as margin.[tpl]Cite web | title = Margins | url=http://www.oxfordfutures.com/futures-education/margins.htm | accessdate = 17 September 2009 | postscript =  [/tpl]
Performance bonds are generally issued as part of a 'Performance and Payment Bond',[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bryantsuretybonds.com/Surety_Bonds/Contract_Bonds/Payment_Bond.html |title=Payment Bond |accessdate=2009-02-23 |publisher=Bryant Surety[/tpl] where a Payment Bond guarantees that the contractor will pay the labour and material costs they are obliged to.
In the United States, under the Miller Act of 1932, all Construction Contracts issued by the Federal Government must be backed by[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.surety1.com/surety/performance-bond |title=Performance Payment Bonds[/tpl] Performance and Payment Bonds. States have enacted what is referred to as “Little Miller Act” statutes requiring Performance and Payment bonds on State Funded projects as well.
Performance Bond Cost. Surety Bond Companies calculate the premium they charge for surety bonds based on three primary criterion: 1) Bond Type 2) Bond Amount 3) the Applicants Risk
Bond Type. Surety Bond Companies have actuarial information on the lifetime claims history for each bond types. Overtime, surety bond underwriters are able to determine that some surety bonds are more risky than others. For example, California Motor vehicle dealer bond has significantly more claims than the straight-forward notary bond. If a given surety bond type has paid out a high percentage of claims then the premium amount paid by applicants will be higher.
Bond Amount. There are over 25,000 types of Surety Bonds in the United States and each bond has a designated bond amount. Surety Bond companies will determine your bond rate based on your risk (see below) and then charge you a surety bond premium in the range 1-15% of the bond amount.
Applicants History/Risk. Surety Bond companies attempt to predict the risk that an applicant represents. Those who are perceived to be a higher risk will pay a higher surety bond premium.  Since Surety bond companies are providing a financial guarantee on the future work performance of those who are bonded, they must have a clear picture of the individuals history. Surety Bond Underwriters will consider the following when determining the premium to be paid by an applicant:
Once the surety bond type, surety bond amount, and applicant risk are adequately assessed, a surety bond underwriter is then able to assign the appropriate surety bond price.
Performance bonds have been around since 2,750 BC and the Romans developed laws of surety around 150 AD,[tpl]Cite book | last=Russell | first=Jeffrey Burton | authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell | coauthors= | title=Surety bonds for construction contracts | year=2000 | publisher=ASCE Press | location=Reston, Va.  | isbn=0-7844-0426-7 | pages=9[/tpl] the principles of which still exist.

[[Occupational hygiene]]
CATEGORIES: Health sciences, Industrial hygiene, Occupational safety and health, Exposure assessment

Occupational (or "industrial" in the U.S.) hygiene (IH) is the control and prevention of hazards from work that may result in injury, illness, or affect the well being of workers. These hazards or stressors are typically divided into the categories biological, chemical, physical, ergonomic and psychosocial.Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists  The risk of a health effect from a given stressor is a function of the hazard multiplied by the exposure to the individual or group.http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12209.html  For chemicals, the hazard can be understood by the dose response profile most often based on toxicological studies or models. Occupational hygienists work closely with toxicologists (see Toxicology) for understanding chemical hazards, physicists (see Physics) for physical hazards, and physicians and microbiologists for biological hazards (see Microbiology Tropical medicine Infection)
The British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) defines that "occupational hygiene is about the prevention of ill-health from work, through recognizing, evaluating and controlling the risks".British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS)  The International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA) refers to occupational hygiene as the discipline of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating and controlling health hazards in the working environment with the objective of protecting worker health and well-being and safeguarding the community at large.International Occupational Hygiene Association definition The term "occupational hygiene" (used in the UK and Commonwealth countries as well as much of  Europe) is synonymous with industrial hygiene (used in the US, Latin America, and other countries that received initial technical support or training from US sources).  The term "industrial hygiene" traditionally stems from industries with construction, mining or manufacturing and "occupational hygiene" refers to all types of industry such as those listed for "industrial hygiene" as well as financial and support services industries and refers to "work", "workplace" and "place of work" in general.  Environmental hygiene addresses similar issues to occupational hygiene, but is likely to be about broad industry or broad issues affecting the local community, broader society, region or country.
The profession of occupational hygiene uses strict and rigorous scientific methodology and often requires professional experience in determining the potential for hazard and exposure risks in workplace and environmental studies.  This aspect of occupational hygiene is often referred to as the "art" of occupational hygiene and is used in a similar sense to the "art" of medicine. In fact "occupational hygiene" is both an aspect of preventative medicine and in particular occupational medicine, in that its goal is to prevent industrial disease, using the science of risk management, exposure assessment and industrial safety.  Ultimately professionals seek to implement "safe" systems, procedures or methods to be applied in the workplace or to the environment.

It is bounded in the east by the Isthmus of Corinth which includes the shipping route of the Corinth Canal, and in the west by the Strait of Rion, which separates the Gulf of Corinth from the outer Gulf of Patras at Cape Drepano, where the narrowest point is crossed by the Rio-Antirio bridge. The Gulf of Corinth is almost surrounded by the prefectures of Aetolia-Acarnania, Phocis in the north, Boeotia in the northeast, Attica in the east, Corinthia in the southeast and south and Achaea in the southwest. The gulf is one of the most seismically active regions in Europe.
In medieval times, the gulf was known as the Gulf of Lepanto. The third Battle of Lepanto was fought here in 1571, destroying the Ottoman fleet. In 1772 another Turkish fleet was destroyed by the Russians at the entrance to the gulf. The town of Lepanto is now named Naupactus.
The shipping routes between Athens and to the ports of the rest of the world including the Mediterranean ports pass along this gulf. Ferry routes link Aigio and Agios Nikolaos in the western part of the gulf.

Mário Coelho Pinto de Andrade (August 21, 1928 – August 26, 1990) was an Angolan poet and politician.
He was born in Golungo Alto, in Portuguese Angola, and studied philology at the University of Lisbon and sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris. While there, he became active in opposing Portuguese colonial rule of Angola, and wrote anti-colonial poetry.
In 1955 he took part in the founding of the Angolan Communist Party. In 1956 he was a founding member of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and was elected its first President in 1960.[tpl]cite web|title=Obituary|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/27/obituaries/mario-de-andrade-62-a-founder-of-angola-s-governing-movement.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] His brother, Joaquim Pinto de Andrade, was made the MPLA's first honorary President.
He married Guadalopean filmmaker Sarah Maldoror and worked with her on the 1972 film about the Angolan liberation movement Sambizanga.
He clashed with his successor, Agostinho Neto, and in 1974 split with the MPLA, founding a new group called Revolta Activa (Active Revolt). Angola became independent on November 11, 1975, but Andrade continued to live in exile in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Mozambique. He died in London.
His publications included the anthologies Letteratura Negra (1961) and La Poésie Africaine d'Espression Portugaise (1969).Keith A. P. Sandiford, A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora, Hansib Publications, 2008, p. 42.

[tpl]nihongo|Dracula Vlad Ţepeş or simply known as Dracula|ドラキュラ|Dorakyura[/tpl] is a fictional character from the multi-platform Castlevania video game series. A vampire and sorcerer, he is the main antagonist of the series and the final boss of almost every installment.
The Dracula of Castlevania is based on Bram Stoker's character in the novel of the same name, who was in turn likely named for Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia. The Castlevania Dracula draws some history from both, but instead of preying on maidens this one threatens whole realms with his armies at the least, and at worst is presented as the very embodiment of evil. He is, however, capable of loving relationships (his evil nature is partly fuelled by the loss of two women he loved) and, despite their differences, he loves his son Alucard.
In the series reboot Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Dracula is reimagined as an 11th-century holy knight named Gabriel Belmont and serves as the central character of the game and its two sequels. The Lords of Shadow series tell the story of Gabriel's quest to save the world, attempt to redeem his past sins and subsequent fall into darkness. The series portrays Dracula in a more sympathetic light, compared to his original counterpart.

The 1960–61 United States network television schedule was for the period that began in September 1960 and ran through March 1961. 
On May 9, 1961, at the annual convention of the National Association of Broadcasters new Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow delivered a scathing speech directed at the "procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western badmen, Western goodmen, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons, and, endlessly, commercials, many screaming, cajoling, and offending, and, most of all, boredom ... Is there one network president in this room who claims he can't do better?"[tpl]cite book| last = Castleman| first = Harry| authorlink = |author2= Walter J.

According to television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), the networks were in a bind, though: they had already purchased their fall 1961 programs and had locked in their 1961–62 schedules. "The best the networks could do was slot a few more public affairs shows, paint rosy pictures for 1962–63, and prepare to endure the barrage of criticism they felt certain would greet the new season."
New fall series are highlighted in bold. All times are Eastern and Pacific.

Nataliya Tsirka, Vienna. 2007 He was famous as a patron of the arts, and also played an important role in the Battle of Poltava where after learning of Peter I's intent to relieve him as acting Hetman of Ukraine and replace him with Alexander Menshikov, he deserted his army and sided with Charles of Sweden. The politicization of this desertion has held a lasting legacy in both Russian and Ukrainian national history.
Because of this, the Russian Orthodox Church has laid an anathema on his name since the beginning of the 18th century and refuses to renounce to this day.

A Nitrous oxide engine is an engine in which the oxygen required for burning the fuel stems from the decomposition of nitrous oxide (N2O) rather than air. The system increases the internal combustion engine's power output by allowing fuel to be burned at a higher rate than would normally be the case, because of the higher partial pressure of oxygen injected into the fuel mixture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2011/09/27/nitrous-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Nitrous: Everything You Need to Know|publisher=Automoblog.net |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2013-07-11[/tpl]

HMS ''Princess Royal'' was the second of two [tpl]sclass-|Lion|battlecruiser[/tpl]s built for the Royal Navy before World War I. Designed in response to the [tpl]sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|2[/tpl]s of the German Navy, the ships significantly improved on the speed, armament, and armour of the preceding [tpl]sclass-|Indefatigable|battlecruiser|4[/tpl]. The ship was named for The Princess Royal, a title occasionally granted to the Monarch's eldest daughter.[tpl]sfn|Silverstone|p=258[/tpl]
Laid down in 1912 and commissioned in 1913, Princess Royal served in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the war began. She was then sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank, Princess Royal scored only a few hits, although one crippled the German armoured cruiser [tpl]SMS|Blücher||2[/tpl]. Shortly afterwards, she became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock.
Princess Royal was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. Princess Royal was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for breaking up as scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

[[Lyman J. Gage]]

Lyman Judson Gage (June 28, 1836 – January 26, 1927) was an American financier and Presidential Cabinet officer.
He was born at DeRuyter, New York, educated at an academy at Rome, New York, and at the age of 17 he became a bank clerk. In 1853 he removed to Chicago, served for three years as bookkeeper, and in 1858 entered the Merchants Loan and Trust Company, where he was cashier in 1861-1868. Afterwards be became successively assistant cashier, vice-president and president of the First National Bank of Chicago, one of the strongest financial institutions in the Middle West.
He was chosen in 1890 to be president of the board of directors of the World's Columbian Exposition, the successful financing of which was due more to him than to any other man. Following the exposition, he became president of the newly formed Chicago Civic Federation, which sought to reform city governance.  In politics he was originally a Republican, and was a delegate to the national convention of the party in 1880, and chairman of its finance committee.
In 1884, however, he supported Grover Cleveland for the presidency, and came to be looked upon as a Democrat. In 1892 President Cleveland, after his second election, offered Gage the post of secretary of the treasury, but Gage declined the offer. In the free-silver campaign of 1896, Gage labored effectively for the election of Republican candidate William McKinley, and from March 1897 until January 1902 he served as Secretary of the Treasury in the cabinets successively of Presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.
As Secretary of the Treasury, Gage was influential in securing passage of the Gold Standard Act of March 14, 1900, which reestablished a currency backed solely by gold. Since this limited the amount of currency in circulation, it initiated a period, continuing until 1912, in which the Secretary of Treasury was obliged to interact in the money market by introducing into circulation the Treasury surplus. The inability of the Treasury to respond to the needs of the market and the perceived need for a currency which would expand and contract with the needs of the nation, led to the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 to regulate the money market.
Gage resigned in 1902 to become a banker in New York. From April 1902 until 1906 he was president of the United States Trust Company in New York City. His administration of the treasury department, through a more than ordinarily trying period, was marked by a conservative policy, looking toward the strengthening of the gold standard, the securing of greater flexibility in the currency, and a more perfect adjustment of the relations between the government and the National banks.
In 1906, Gage indulged his longtime interest in metaphysical phenomena by purchasing property on and subsequently living at Lomaland, a Theosophist retreat in Southern California.  Though this came as somewhat of a shock to the American public, those who knew him privately were not surprised, as Gage had previously studied spiritualism, astrology, and prophesized the death of his own brother through a "psychic flash".Chronicling America - The Library of Congress at www.loc.gov
Gage was one of the 30 founding members of the Simplified Spelling Board, founded in 1906 by Andrew Carnegie to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the orthography of the English language."CARNEGIE ASSAULTS THE SPELLING BOOK; To Pay the Cost of Reforming English Orthography. CAMPAIGN ABOUT TO BEGIN Board Named, with Headquarters Here -- Local Societies Throughout the Country.", The New York Times, March 12, 1906. Accessed August 28, 2008.
He died at San Diego, California, in 1927 and is buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

[[Bohemond VII, Count of Tripoli]]
CATEGORIES: 1261 births, 1287 deaths, Counts of Tripoli

Bohemond VII of Tripoli (1261 – October 19, 1287) was the count of Tripoli and nominal prince of Antioch from 1275 to his death. The only part left of the once great Principality of Antioch was the port of Latakia. He spent much of his reign at war with the Templars (1277–1282).
Bohemond VII was the son of Bohemond VI of Antioch and his wife Sibylla of Armenia. As Bohemond VII was still underage at his succession, Sibylla acted as regent, although the regency was also unsuccessfully claimed by Hugh I of Jerusalem, Bohemond's closest living male relative. Sibylla appointed Bartholomew, Bishop of Tortosa, to act as bailie. Bohemond spent his minority under the protection of Leo III of Armenia at his court in Cilicia. He returned to Tripoli in 1277 and immediately made peace with Qalawun, the Mamluk sultan, and recognised Roger of San Severino as regent at Acre for Charles I of Jerusalem. He exempted the Venetians from harbour duties, thus distancing the Genoese and their allies.
Upon his return, he made enemies with the powerful Embriaco family, which governed Jebail through Guy II. Tripoli was very weak at this time and was divided among various factions: the Roman faction led by Paul of Segni, Bishop of Tripoli, and the Armenian faction led by Sibylla and Bartholomew. Paul made friends with William of Beaujeu, the new Grand Master of the Knights Templar, and then with the normally anti-Templar Embriacos. This precipitated the first of a series of wars between Bohemond and the Templars. First, he burned their building in Tripoli. Then, the Templars responded by razing the comital castle of Botron and attacking Nephin. Bohemond marched on Jebail but was defeated and forced to sign a truce.
In 1278, Guy of Jebail and the Templars assaulted Tripoli, but were met outside the walls by Bohemond. Bohemond was defeated, but the Templar fleet of twelve galleys was scattered by a storm and Bohemond's fleet of fifteen attacked and damaged Templar Sidon. This time a truce was mediated by Nicholas Lorgne, Grand Master of the Hospital. The last conflict began in January 1282, when the Embriacos tried to take Tripoli by surprise. They found the Templar master away and so took refuge with the Hospitallers, who handed them over to Bohemond on condition that he would spare their lives. He buried them up to their necks in sand at Nephin and starved them to death. This last act further alienated the Genoese and the Montforts, but Bohemund beat the latter in taking control of Jebail.
In 1287, Latakia was taken by Qalawun, who claimed that as part of Antioch it did not fall under the conditions of their treaty. Bohemond died soon after, leaving no children by his wife Margaret of Acre. Tripoli was plunged into a succession crisis until his sister Lucia arrived from Europe to take control of the county.
Local legend in Lebanon reports that when Bohemond escaped Latakia, he hid in the village of Tula, Batroun, in the Northern Lebanese mountains. Legend has it that he lived there for a while, and produced offspring, from which the Prince, Conte, Zeeni and Aboujaoude families claim descent. The "Balamand" Monastery in Batroun is reputed a gift of the Prince's family, and now hosts a major University (Balamand University), Balamand being a local adaptation of Bohemond.

[[Clearing the cervical spine]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency medicine, Emergency medical services

Clearing the cervical spine is the process by which medical professionals determine whether cervical spine injuries exist. This process can take place in the emergency department or take place in the field by appropriately trained EMS personnel. The following is based on the NEXUS (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) criteria. There are other clinical criteria in common use, such as the Canadian C-spine rule.
Excluding a cervical spinal injury requires clinical judgement and training. 
When a significant mechanism of injury is present, a cervical spine is determined to be stable if:
If the patient does not meet all the above criteria then they require a three view cervical x-ray series, adding a swimmer's view if the lateral doesn't include the C7/T1 interface. In those with degenerative disease of the cervical spine, a plain film series is often inadequate to assess for injury.
If the patient has a head injury with altered sensorium, is intoxicated, or has been given potent analgesics, then the cervical spine must remain immobilised until the clinical examination becomes possible.
If the patient is not expected to be clinically evaluable within 48–72 hours because of severe head or multiple injuries, they should remain immobilized until a time when such an examination is possible. A 64-slice CT with reconstructions does not entirely rule out ligamentous injury leading to instability, but is a practical means of identifying the majority of C-spine injuries in obtunded patients. MR C-spine suffers from frequent false-positives, limiting its usefulness. 
The indication for MR spine is a focal neurological deficit. Another indication for MR of the cervical spine is persistent mid-line neck pain or tenderness despite a normal CT in the awake patient.
Neurosurgeons or orthopaedic surgeons manage any detected injury. Today, most large centers have Spine Surgery specialists, that have trained in this field after their Orthopedic or Neurosurgical residency.

[[Faces of Death II]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 films, American documentary films, Mondo films, Faces of Death, Sequel films, 1981 horror films

Faces of Death II is the first sequel to the 1978 mondo film Faces of Death. Like its predecessor, the film was written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (as "Alan Black" and "Conan Le Cilaire" respectively). Schwartz puts in another cameo appearance, this time as the wounded criminal in front of the drug store. Dr. Francis B. Gröss (portrayed by Michael Carr) again narrates the proceedings.
This film focuses largely on stunt work gone wrong, as well as death in sports. Several scenes involve the attempt by Kenny Powers to jump a rocket-powered car over the St Lawrence River in Canada and land over one mile away in New York. Also featured nearly in its entirety is the 1980 boxing match between Johnny Owen and Lupe Pintor, with Owen being knocked out and later dying from the injuries sustained in the match.

[[The Donna Reed Show]]
CATEGORIES: 1958 American television series debuts, 1966 American television series endings, 1950s American television series, 1960s American television series, American Broadcasting Company network shows, American television sitcoms, Black-and-white television programs, English-language television programming, Television series by Sony Pictures Television

The Donna Reed Show is an American situation comedy starring Donna Reed as the upper-middle-class housewife Donna Stone. Carl Betz co-stars as her pediatrician husband Dr. Alex Stone, and Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen as their teenage children, Mary and Jeff. The show originally aired on ABC from September 24, 1958 to March 19, 1966. When Fabares left the show in 1963, Petersen's little sister, Patty Petersen, joined the cast as adopted daughter Trisha. Patty Petersen had first appeared in the episode, "A Way of Her Own", on January 31, 1963. Actress Janet Landgard was a series regular from 1963-1965 as Karen Holmby.Donna Reed Org
Bob Crane and Ann McCrea appeared in the last seasons as the Kelseys, friends of the Stones, and Darryl Richard became a near regular as Smitty, Jeff's best buddy. The show featured a variety of celebrity guests including Esther Williams as a famous dress designer, baseball superstars Don Drysdale and Willie Mays as themselves, teen heartthrob James Darren as a pop singer with the measles, canine superstar Lassie as herself, and young Jay North of CBS's Dennis the Menace.
The series was created by William S. Roberts and developed by Reed and her then husband, producer Tony Owen. Episodes revolved around typical family problems of the period such as firing a clumsy housekeeper, throwing a retirement bash for a colleague, and finding quality time away from the children. Edgy themes such as women's rights and freedom of the press were occasionally explored.
The show had an uncertain start in the ratings and was almost cancelled, but fared better when it was moved from Wednesday to Thursday nights. In the show's middle seasons, Fabares sang what became a #1 teen pop hit "Johnny Angel", and Petersen had above average success with the song "My Dad", also introduced during the course of the series.
The Donna Reed Show was one of television's top 25 shows in 1963-1964. Reed was repeatedly nominated for Emmy Awards between 1959 and 1962, and won a Golden Globe as Best Female TV Star in 1963. She eventually grew tired of the work-a-day grind involved in the program, and it was cancelled in 1966 after 275 episodes.
The series was sponsored by Campbell Soup Company, with Johnson & Johnson as the principal alternate sponsor (succeeded in the fall of 1963 by The Singer Company).[tpl]Cite book|last=Leibman|first=Nina Clare |title=Living Room Lectures: The Fifties Family in Film and Television|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1995|pages=58|isbn=0-292-74684-9[/tpl]  Following first-run, the show entered daytime reruns on ABC and then syndication on Nick at Nite and TVLand for several years. The first five seasons have been released on DVD.
Reed's character, Donna Stone, is a loving mother and wife, but also a strong woman, an active participant in her community, a woman with feelings and a sense of humor. According to many of Reed's friends and family, Reed shared many similarities to the character that she portrayed on screen, implying that the fictional Donna Stone was a near-identical copy of Reed herself.
In a 2008 interview, Paul Petersen (Jeff Stone) stated, "Donna Reed Show'' depicts a better time and place. It has a sort of level of intelligence and professionalism that is sadly lacking in current entertainment products. The messages it sent out were positive and uplifting. The folks you saw were likable, the family was fun, the situations were familiar to people. It provided 22-and-a-half-minutes of moral instructions and advice on how to deal with the little dilemmas of life. Jeff and Mary and their friends had all the same problems that real kids in high school did." Petersen continued, "That's what the show was really about, the importance of family. That's where life's lessons are transmitted, generation to generation. There's a certain way in which these are transmitted, with love and affection."[tpl]cite web|title=Life was better in ‘Donna Reed' world|url=http://www.catholic.org/ae/tv/review.php?id=30989[/tpl]

[[San Martin Txiki]]
CATEGORIES: Basque mythology, Trickster gods

San Martin Txiki ("Little Saint Martin") is the Trickster figure from Basque mythology. "Txiki" (pronounced "cheeky") means "little" in an affectionate sense. San Martin is often called simply "Martintxiki" or "Samartitxiki". He stole the secrets of planting, sowing, and harvesting from the Basajaunak (lords of the woods). He also invented the first saws, modeling them after the edges of the chestnut leaf.
San Martin Txiki also exists in Aragonese mythology in the valleys of Tena, Ansó and Broto (places where local toponimia derives from basque) under the name San Martinico.

Norman Washington Manley MM, QC, National Hero of Jamaica (4 July 1893 – 2 September 1969), was a Jamaican statesman.  A Rhodes Scholar, Manley became one of Jamaica's leading lawyers in the 1920s.  With his cousin, Alexander Bustamante, Manley was an advocate of universal suffrage, which was granted by Parliament to the colony in 1944.
Together with Bustamante, in 1938 he founded the left-wing People's National Party[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] which later was tied to the Trade Union Congress and the National Workers Union.  He led the PNP in every election from 1944 to 1967.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl] Their efforts resulted in the New Constitution of 1944, granting full adult suffrage.
Manley served as the colony's Chief Minister from 1955 to 1959, and as Premier from 1959 to 1962.  He was a proponent of the island's participation in the Federation of the West Indies but bowed to pressure to hold a referendum on the issue in 1961. Voters chose to have Jamaica withdraw from the union.

Thomas Howell Cobb (September 7, 1815 – October 9, 1868) was an American political figure. A Southern Democrat, Cobb was a five-term member of the United States House of Representatives and Speaker of the House from 1849 to 1851. He also served as a Secretary of Treasury under President James Buchanan (1857–1860) and the 40th Governor of Georgia (1851–1853).
He is, however, probably best known as one of the founders of the Confederate States of America, having served as the President of the Provisional Confederate Congress, when delegates of the secessionist states issued creation of the Confederacy.
Cobb served for two weeks between the foundation of the Confederacy and the election of Jefferson Davis as first President. This made him, as the Speaker of the Congress, provisional Head of State at this time.

CATEGORIES: Basque music, Spanish punk rock groups

La Polla Records was a Basque Spanish punk rock band. They were formed in 1979 in Salvatierra/Agurain, a small town in the Basque Country (Spain). Its founders were Evaristo Páramos on vocals, Maleguin on bass, Fernandito on drums and Txarly and Sumé on guitars. The name was somewhat controversial because in Spanish, "polla" is vulgarly slang for "cock". The lyrics of the band harshly criticized fascism, militarism, capitalism, and catholicism.

[[Free response]]
CATEGORIES: Educational assessment and evaluation

Free response, usually referred to as essay, is a type of question used in tests in education, workplace, and government.  Most free response questions ask or require the test-taker to state a belief, opinion, or write a short essay and support it with facts, examples, or other evidence.  However, few tests solely rely on these types of problems, and tend to work in conjunction with other types, such as multiple choice.  Free response questions generally test more than straight knowledge and ask for a "big picture" type of response (see example).  Also, they usually allow the taker to choose an area in which they are familiar. 
Free-response items are distinct from fixed-response items in that examiners must supply a full and independent response. There are no answer options from which to choose. Free-response items are typically discouraged from examinations because of the difficulty, bias, and time effort required in grading them. However, some general guidelines for developing these questions include the following:
The shorter the answer required for a given essay item, generally the better. More objectives can be tested in the same period of time, and factors such as verbal fluency, spelling, etc., have less of an opportunity to influence the grader. 
1)Help the examiners focus their answers by giving them a starting sentence for their essay.
2) Make sure questions are sharply focused on a single issue. Do not give either the examiner or the grader too much freedom in determining what the answer should be.
Supporters argue that this type of question on tests is that it gives a better indication of the competence and intelligence of the test taker than other more standardized responses, which are claimed to often only measure test-taking ability. However, critics charge that the quality of a free response answer is often determined more by ability with the language in which it is given than competence or intelligence.

Robert William Burchfield CNZM, CBE (27 January 1923 – 5 July 2004) was a lexicographer, scholar, and writer, who edited the Oxford English Dictionary for thirty years to 1986, and was Chief Editor from 1971.
Born in Wanganui, New Zealand, he studied at Wanganui Technical College and Victoria University in Wellington. After war service in the Royal New Zealand Artillery, he graduated MA from Wellington in 1948 and won a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford University, in England, where he was tutored by C.S. Lewis.  He became a Fellow of Magdalen and lecturer in English straight after graduating (1952–3), subsequently moving colleges to Christ Church (1953–57) and St Peter's (1955–79).  Through C. T. Onions, then Magdalen librarian, he assisted in editing one of Onions’s projects, the Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology. His preparation of an edition of the Ormulum was supervised by J.R.R. Tolkien.OED/Independent
Onions recommended him to Dan Davin as editor of the second Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary, which he worked on from 1957 to 1986.  He re-established the network of volunteer readers sending in records of words which had helped to create the original OED, and had then been allowed to fall away.OED/Independent  In 2004 it emerged that Burchfield's second supplement had removed a large number of words which were present in the earlier 1933 supplement edited by Onions and William Craigie, which Burchfield's second supplement incorporated.Sarah Ogilvie, "From Outlandish Words to World English: the legitimization of global varieties of English in the OED", Euralex Conference, Lorient, France, July, 2004] Four years later the full nature of his treatment of foreign words was shown: he deleted 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English; and his coverage was not as extensive as his predecessors, especially Charles Onions who included 45% more loanwords and World Englishes.Sarah Ogilvie, "Rethinking Burchfield and World Englishes" International Journal of Lexicography, 21: 23–59, 2008 In 2012, a book documented Burchfield’s work and showed that many of these omitted words had only a single recorded usage, but their removal ran against what was thought to be the established OED editorial practice, and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to 'World English'.Sarah Ogilvie, "Words of the World: A Global History of the Oxford English Dictionary", ISBN 1107605695 Cambridge University Press, 2013Leslie Kaufmann, "Dictionary Dust-Up (Danchi Is Involved)", The New York Times, 28 November 2012Alison Flood "Former OED editor covertly deleted thousand of words, book claims", The Guardian, 27 November 2012  The author of the book concerned, Sarah Ogilvie, complained that people were unfairly judging Burchfield and that her coverage had been misleadingly reported in the media.The Guardian books blog, 27 November 2012, Sarah Ogilvie  "Focusing on the OED's missing words is missing the point"Huffington Post books blog, 29 November 2012, Sarah Ogilvie "The OED, A Truly Global Dictionary"
In retirement he produced a controversial new edition, substantially rewritten and less prescriptivist, of Fowler's Modern English Usage, the long established style guide by Henry Watson Fowler.  He died in Abingdon at age 81 in 2004. He married twice and had three children.OED/Independent

CATEGORIES: Brown sauces, French sauces

Sauce Robert is a brown mustard sauce and one of the small sauces, or compound sauces, derived from the Classic French Espagnole sauce, one of the mother sauces in French cuisine.Escoffier, Auguste. "The Escoffier Cookbook." Crown Publishers, Inc, New York, 1969. p15. Sauce Robert is one of the earliest compound sauces on record. Of the 78 compound sauces systematized by Marie-Antoine Carême in the early 19th century, only two - Sauce Robert and Remoulade - were present in much older cookbooks, such as Massaliot's Le Cuisinier Roial et Bourgeois in 1691. A version of Sauce Robert also appears in Francois-Pierre de la Varenne (cook to Henry IV)'s Le Cuisinier François (1651), the founding text of modern French cuisine.Sokolov, Raymond "The Saucier's Apprentice," 'A brief history of French Sauces' pages 5-7. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc 1976.
Sauce Robert is made from chopped onions cooked in butter without color, a reduction of white wine, pepper, an addition of demi-glace and is finished with mustard.Saulnier, Louis. Le Répertoire de la Cuisine. 7th Edition. English Edition. Hardcover, printed by Lowe and Brydone, London. No copyright date is listed, book was purchased in 1954. p 23.
It is best suited to pork, especially grilled pork, and meats.Escoffier, p. 31

Following and extending the tradition of modernist novelists like Marcel Proust and James Joyce, the plot of To the Lighthouse is secondary to its philosophical introspection. The novel includes little dialogue and almost no action; most of it is written as thoughts and observations. The novel recalls childhood emotions and highlights adult relationships. Among the book's many tropes and themes are those of loss, subjectivity, and the problem of perception.
In 1998, the Modern Library named To the Lighthouse No. 15 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web | title = 100 Best Novels | publisher = Random House | year=  1999 | url =  http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html | accessdate = 11 January 2010 [/tpl] This ranking was by the Modern Library Editorial Board of authors. In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html | work=Time | title=All Time 100 Novels | accessdate=25 May 2010 | date=16 October 2005[/tpl]

[[Endogeny]]
CATEGORIES: Biology

Endogenous substances are those that originate from within an organism, tissue, or cell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=endogenous |title=Endogenous | Define Endogenous at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11[/tpl]
Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are DNA sequences derived from viruses that are ancestrally inserted into the genomes of germ cells. These sequences, which may be fragments of viruses, or entire viral genomes (proviruses), can persist in the germline, being passed on from one generation to the next as host alleles.
Endogenous processes include senescence, the menstrual cycle and the self-sustained circadian rhythms of plants and animals.
In some biological systems, endogeneity refers to the recipient of DNA (usually in prokaryotes). However, because of homeostasis, discerning between internal and external influences is often difficult.
Endogenous transcription factors refers to those that are manufactured by the cell, as opposed to cloned transcription factors.

[[Lucia, Countess of Tripoli]]
CATEGORIES: 13th-century births, 14th-century deaths, Counts of Tripoli, Women of the Crusader states, 13th-century female rulers, House of Toucy

Lucia (died aft. 1292 or ca 1299) was the last countess of Tripoli, a Crusader state in the Levant.
She was the daughter of Bohemund VI, Prince of Antioch and Sibylla of Armenia. Her brother was Bohemund VII of Tripoli. When Bohemund VII died in 1287, their mother appointed as regent Bertrand of Gibelet. He proved to be very unpopular with the commune of the city, who created their own administration. Lucia then came to Tripoli from Auxerre, where she had married ca 1275 or 1278 Narjot de Toucy, to take control of the county, although she was opposed by both the commune and the Genoese. The Genoese, led by Benedetto Zaccaria, tried to install a podestà, an official administrator from Genoa, which would have made Tripoli essentially a Genoese colony. At this the leader of the commune consented to acknowledge Lucia, but Lucia unexpectedly allied herself with the Genoese instead. 
The Venetians and Pisans, who also had trading links with Tripoli, were shocked at this and supposedly conspired with the Mameluk sultan Qalawun to attack the city. Lucia allied with the Mongols, who, knowing that Tripoli was too weak to defend itself even with their help, asked for support from Europe, although no aid was to be found there. Qalawun started the Siege of Tripoli for one month in 1289 and captured it on April 26. Two years later Acre, the last Crusader outpost in the Holy Land was also captured. 
Although he could have claimed the county through her, Lucia's husband never came to Tripoli, as he was attending to business in the Kingdom of Naples, where he died in 1292. The date of Lucia's death is unknown. Narjot and Lucia had one son, Philippe de Toucy, who inherited the lordship of Terza on Narjot's death and the claim to Antioch on Lucia's death.

[[The Verlaines]]
CATEGORIES: New Zealand rock music groups, New Zealand indie rock groups, Flying Nun Records artists, Homestead Records artists, Dunedin Sound

The Verlaines are a rock band from Dunedin, New Zealand. Formed in 1981 by Graeme Downes, Craig Easton, Anita Pillai, Phillip Higham and Greg Kerr, the band went through multiple line-ups before going on an extended hiatus after their 1997 album Over The Moon. In 2003 a career retrospective, You're Just Too Obscure for Me, was released.
The band were named after French poet Paul Verlaine—not, as is occasionally suggested, Tom Verlaine, who also took his stage name from the poet. 
The Verlaines were noted for their angular, "difficult" song structures, wordy and downbeat lyrics, unusual subject matter all contained in often frantic up-tempo playing. The Verlaines were led by songwriter and vocalist/guitarist Graeme Downes although many other New Zealand musicians played guitar, bass, drums and brass instruments during the different stages of the band.
In 1993, the band contributed the track "Heavy 33" to the AIDS-Benefit Album No Alternative, and in 1995, the song "Some Fantasy" (a Doublehappys cover) to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered, both produced by the Red Hot Organization.
Their signature songs included "Death and the Maiden", "C.D. Jimmy Jazz & Me", "Bird-dog" and "Ballad of Harry Noryb".
The band's recorded debut was on the seminal Dunedin Double EP, which was released by Flying Nun Records and was the debut of several bands who would go on to be central to the mythology of the Dunedin Sound.
Downes is an academic at the University of Otago, where he is head of the Department of Music.  He teaches contemporary music and has research interests in Mahler and Shostakovich. He has released one solo album, Hammers and Anvils, which came out on Matador Records in 2001.
The Verlaines' fansite reported on 11 February 2007 that a new album was being produced.  On 10 December 2007, this new album Pot Boiler was released on Flying Nun.  
In 2009, the Verlaines released another new album, Corporate Moronic, through Dunedin Music.
The Verlaines contributed the soundtrack to the film Eden, collaborating with actor Adetokunbo Adu, and screenwriter Rebecca Tansley. A song from Eden, What Sound is This? appeared on their album Untimely Meditations in 2012.

[[Lesbian feminism]]

CATEGORIES: Feminism and history, Feminism and sexual orientation, Feminist theory, Intersectional feminism, Lesbian feminism, Lesbianism, Sexual orientation and society, Lesbian feminists

Lesbian feminism is a cultural movement and critical perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), that questions the position of lesbians and women in society. It particularly refutes heteronormativity, the assumption that everyone is "straight" and society should be structured to serve heterosexual needs. Some key thinkers and activists are Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys and Monique Wittig (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory).
Historically lesbianism has been closely associated with feminism, going back at least to the 1890s. "Lesbian feminism" is a related movement that came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with second-wave feminism and the gay liberation movement.Faderman, Lillian: "Surpassing the Love of Men," p. 17. Quill/William Morrow, 1981.Lesbianism and Feminism. Accessed May 28th 2007.
In the words of lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, "Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM Liberation Movement began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the GLF Liberation Front left to join up with their sisters".Jeffreys, Sheila: "Unpacking Queer Politics," p. 19. Polity, 2003.
According to Judy Rebick, a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism,  lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the women's movement, while their issues were invisible in the same movement.Research on International Activism

Ruthe Lewin Winegarten (August 26, 1929 – June 14, 2004) was an American author, activist, and historian. Born in Dallas in 1929, Winegarten attended Forest Avenue High School (known today as James Madison High School), receiving a scholarship to attend Southern Methodist University. She also attended the University of Texas at Austin, where she received her bachelor's degree in anthropology in 1950, and was active in helping to get the first black student admitted to the University of Texas Law School. She later earned a master's degree in social work from the University of Texas at Arlington and did coursework for a doctorate in history at the University of Texas at Dallas.
Before moving back to Austin, Texas in 1978, Winegarten worked for various social causes in Dallas, including serving as the southwest regional director of the Anti-defamation league of the B'nai B'rith, and as assistant director of the Jewish Welfare Federation in Dallas.  She also was active in the North Dallas Democratic Women's Club and performed in musical spoofs with future Texas Governor Ann Richards.
While researching a thesis paper in the 1970s at the University of Texas at Dallas, she compiled an oral history of Annie Mae Hunt. Later she and collaborators would edit these conversations, including Hunt's recollections of her grandparents' histories of slavery, into a popular book, I am Annie Mae: A Black Texas Woman in Her Own Words and then subsequently into a musical drama. 
After returning to Austin, Winegarten became director of Austin's Women's Center.  In 1979, she was appointed as Curator of the Texas Women's History Project, which developed the touring exhibit "Texas Women: A Celebration of History" (now housed at Texas Woman's University).  Later, Winegarten oversaw the addition of women to the exhibits in the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum in Austin.
Winegarten twice won the Liz Carpenter Award, for her books Black Texas Women: 150 Years of Trial and Triumph, and Capitol Women: Texas Female Legislators 1923–1999.  The Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year by the Texas State Historical Association. Winegarten was made a fellow of the TSHA in 2003. She authored or co-authored a total of 18 books, primarily on subjects in Texas women's history.  The last of these was Las Tejanas: 300 years of History (with Teresa Palomo Acosta).
The Ruthe Winegarten Memorial Foundation for Women in Texas History, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, was started by a group of her colleagues to carry on her work. The Foundation's website is: www.womenintexashistory.org.
Winegarten bore three children, Martha Frances Addington, (1952–2007), Marc David Sanders (1954– ), and Debra Lou Winegarten (1957– ).
Winegarten died in 2004, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She had been living at an assisted-living facility and was in the early stages of dementia.
Writings about Ruthe Winegarten include the book Mum's the Word (Austin, Texas: Sunbelt Media, 2001), and an obituary in Off Our Backs.http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_200407/ai_n9430195

The experimental transport aircraft combined the capabilities of a helicopter for vertical take-off and landing with those of a fixed-wing aircraft for cruise. The Ka-22 carried a large payload, having a hold comparable in size to the Antonov An-12. Eight world records for altitude and speed were set by the Ka-22 in its class, none of which have since been broken."Helicopter Ka-22." Kamov Company.'' Retrieved: 5 June 2008.

[[Reserved powers]]

CATEGORIES: Federalism, Constitutions

In comparative federalism and comparative constitutionalism reserved powers or residual powers are those powers which are not "enumerated" (written down, assigned).  In various federal and decentralized political systems, certain areas are assigned to either the central (or federal) government or the regional (or state or provincial) government; however it is not possible to list all possible subject that might be legislated on for all time.  Therefore, the framers of major constitutional documents tend to assign all other subjects that may arise after the document is enacted to one of the two orders of government.  This is considered a major power in its own right.  [tpl]quote|In Canada, for example, the reserved powers lie with the federal government; in the United States, the reserved powers lie with the constituent states. http://www.forumfed.org/en/federalism/introductiontohandbook.php[/tpl]

[[Homecoming Saga]]
CATEGORIES: Novels by Orson Scott Card, Science fiction book series, LDS fiction

The Homecoming Saga is a science fiction series by Orson Scott Card. The series is patterned on the Book of Mormon."The Book of Mormon - Artifact or Artifice?" article by Card from Nauvoo.com Some of the names also come from the Book of Mormon.
The series, containing five volumes, is set forty million years in the future, with volumes 1-3 taking place on a planet called Harmony. After the Earth was rendered uninhabitable by human wars, mankind departed for Harmony, as well as at least forty other planets. (Only two of these are named in the series: Ramadan, settled by Arabs; and Harmony, apparently settled by Slavs, as its languages all developed from Russian.)
On Harmony, the colonists established the Oversoul - an artificial intelligence, monitoring the planet with a small army of satellites. It also influences the actions of humans. Though it does not prevent them from doing evil, it keeps their destruction limited by suppressing any thoughts that might lead to things like long-distance travel or instant communication. Thus the technology on Harmony includes basic computers, presumably without advanced Internet capabilities, although the Oversoul was used for basic data transfer, and solar-powered handheld energy weapons, but no cars or even wagons.
The Oversoul, designed to last only twenty million years, eventually begins to break down. It decides to send an expedition back to Earth to seek advice from the entity of which it is an imitation: the mysterious Keeper of Earth.  Soon after, the people begin to receive dreams similar to those that the Oversoul sends; these come directly from the Keeper of Earth, demonstrating faster-than-light transmission on its part.
The journey to the site of the ships, which is a slow trek across the desert often interrupted by pregnancies, occupies the first three books.  The fourth book, Earthfall, concerns itself with the journey of one of the ships, and the job of establishing a settlement and reconciling human culture with the existing creatures that have risen on Earth in the meantime.  The final volume, Earthborn, takes place five centuries in the future; the one remaining member of the original expedition sets the changing culture on the right path, and sees the Oversoul's mission finally fulfilled.

The Graham Norton Effect is a talk show hosted by the Irish comedian Graham Norton. The show aired on Comedy Central from June 24, 2004 to September 16, 2004.
The Graham Norton Effect can be considered a spin-off to two previous shows hosted by Norton, including So Graham Norton and V Graham Norton. During the last part of Graham's Channel 4 contract, Graham decided to film a new show, NY Graham Norton, in New York. The Graham Norton Effect was filmed for Comedy Central later in the year. Since this show was specifically taped for an American audience, some of the games played in the show were previously played on NY Graham Norton or V Graham Norton. (For example, a game about the world's worst bathing suits which was played in the Alan Cumming episode was originally played during a V episode with Bo Derek, tying into her movie 10.) Also, some of the guests, who were only on NY Graham Norton a couple of months previous, appear again on The Graham Norton Effect.

[[Actualism]]
CATEGORIES: Modal logic, Ontology, Metaphysical theories, Possible worlds, Analytic philosophy

In contemporary analytic philosophy, actualism is a position on the ontological status of possible worlds that holds that everything that exists (i.e., everything there is) is actual.Actualism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)Plantinga, Alvin (1976). "Actualism and Possible Worlds". Theoria 42 (1–3): pp. 139–160. (Reprinted in his compilation Essays on the Metaphysics of Modality, Oxford University Press). Another phrasing of the thesis is that the domain of unrestricted quantiﬁcation ranges over all and only actual existents.Woodward, Richard (2011). "The things that aren't actually there". Philosophical Studies 152: pp. 155–166.
The denial of actualism is possibilism, the thesis that there are some entities that are merely possible: these entities exist (in the same way that ordinary objects around us do) but are not to be found in the actual world. Regarding Modal realism: "An important but significantly different notion of possibilism to which many of the issues in this article do not apply was developed by the philosopher David Lewis."

Aparo's style was primarily in the tradition of his influential contemporary Neal Adams, striving for realistic renditions of his subject rather than caricature or exaggeration. Aparo's muscular figures tended to be leaner than those drawn by most of his peers. He paid particular attention to detail in rendering vehicles, "street clothes", architecture, and landscape. He frequently tilted the viewpoint so that the horizon line in a panel was significantly angled away from level, and used props such as potted plants and furniture to emphasize depth in a setting. He was also known for inserting drawings of celebrities such as Humphrey Bogart, Peter Falk, Ed McMahon, and Fred Allen as background characters in heavily populated scenes.

Toronto—Danforth includes a vibrant array of ethnicities, including large Greek, Chinese, Muslim and South Asian communities.
It has long been one of the more left-leaning ridings in Toronto.  Most election contests take place between the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party.  The NDP held the riding for the first nine years of its existence before Liberal Dennis Mills won the seat in 1988 and held it during the long period of Liberal dominance of the federal scene.  He was unseated in 2004 by Layton, who had previously run against Mills in 1997.
The northern portion of the riding, East York, tends to lean right-of-centre, while the southern half, including Riverdale, Leslieville and Queen–Broadview Village, usually swings to the left.
Layton sought neighbourhood input for another name change to the riding. Layton's supposed choice was "East York—Danforth—Riverdale", but the name was not changed.

Paul Rebhan (also known as Reb Han http://www.rebhan.org) is an author, musician, and artist living in New York City.  He is known for hanging one of his own paintings in the Museum of Modern Art, and as the inventor of Quiet Parties, also called Silent Dating, where people communicate by writing notes instead of speaking . He also rents himself out as a "friend", and wrote a philosophy book that seems to share a similar skeptical viewpoint of epistemology as Michel Foucault, the French postmodernist philosopher.
Rebhan was one of the initial artists to use the term Perceptual Art in describing his work.  This is a highly interactive form of art, often reliant on new technologies such as the Internet, that were not available to artists of previous generations.  In the words of Rebhan, Perceptual Art has the intent of "altering individual and collective perception http://rebfile.com/rebfile-about.htm."

CATEGORIES: Mongols, Ethnic groups in Mongolia, Khalkha

The Khalkha (Mongolian: Халх; Khalkh) is the largest subgroup of Mongol people in Mongolia since the 15th century. The Khalkha together with Chahar, Ordos and Tumed, were directly ruled by the Chinggisid Khans until the 20th century; unlike the Oirat people who were ruled by the Dzungar nobles or the Khorchins who were ruled by Khasar's descendants. There were originally two major Khalkha groups, of which each ruled by the direct male line descendants of Dayan Khan. The Baarin, Khongirad, Jaruud, Baigut, and the O'zeed (Ujeed) became Dayan Khan's fifth son Achibolod's subjects, thus formed the Southern Five Halhs. The Kerait, Jalair, Olkhunut, Khatagin, Besut, Iljigin, Gorlos, Uriankhai, Sartuul, Tanghut, Khotogoid, Khuree, and Tsookhor became Dayan Khan's youngest (could be third) son Geresenje's ([tpl]lang-mn|Гэрсэне Жалайр Хан[/tpl]) subjects, thus formed the "Аглагийн арван гурван хүрээ Халх" or The Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North. There were also numerous direct descendants of Genghis Khan who had formed the ruling class of the Khalkha Mongols prior to the 20th century, but they were and still also regarded as Khalkha Mongols rather than belonging to a special unit. The Thirteen Khalkhas of the Far North are the major subethnic group of the independent state of Mongolia. They number 1,610,400, or 78.8 percent, of Mongolia's population (1989 figures).

Spirit of Peoria is a riverboat that normally runs in the Peoria, Illinois area on the Illinois River watershed. The boat participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion. Spirit of Peoria is a true paddleboat, actually using its paddlewheel for propulsion, unlike some modern riverboats with purely cosmetic wheels.
The boat was designed by architect Alan Bates, and built in 1988 at the Walker Boat Yard in Paducah, Kentucky, making it the first paddleboat vessel built there. The propulsion system was designed by Norm Rittenhouse, with steering by Custom Hydraulics.
Spirit of Peoria has no propellers or thrusters, and is powered by twin Caterpillar 3412 diesel gensets, producing 700 kilowatts combined in 208 volt 3-phase voltage. The power is rectified using railroad-style rectifiers, probably from a GM GP38. The DC voltage goes to two traction engines, also from a GM locomotive, which drive the paddlewheel via two [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|1|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide[/tpl] chains. This allows the boat to be comparatively fast and efficient, burning approximately [tpl]convert|15|USgal|l[/tpl] of diesel fuel an hour, with a top speed of over [tpl]convert|15|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The dry weight is about 275 tons,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spiritofpeoria.com/info/about-the-boat/ |title=About the Boat |website=Spirit of Peoria |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] with a passenger capacity of 487. The boat carries [tpl]convert|3500|USgal|l[/tpl] of fuel and [tpl]convert|2500|USgal|l[/tpl] of water. 
The regular area of travel of the boat ranges from Pere Marquette State Park near Grafton, Illinois to Starved Rock State Park near Ottawa, Illinois. The boat is owned and captained by G. Alex Grieves, and co-captained by Harold Breitenbach.

Christmas lights are lights used for decoration around Christmas. The custom goes back to the use of candles to decorate the Christmas tree in upper-class homes in 18th-century Germany. Christmas trees displayed publicly and illuminated with electric lights became popular in the early 20th century. By the mid-20th century, it became customary to display strings of electric lights as along streets and on buildings Christmas decorations detached from the Christmas tree itself. In the United States, it became popular to outline private homes with such Christmas lights in tract housing beginning in the 1960s. By the late 20th century, the custom had also been adopted in non-western countries, notably in Japan.

The 1976 Atlantic hurricane season was an average Atlantic hurricane season, officially starting on June 1, 1976 and ending on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic Ocean. The season produced 23 tropical cyclones, of which ten developed into named storms; six became hurricanes, and two attained major hurricane status. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Belle, which reached Category 3 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale east of North Carolina; Belle later struck Long Island, New York as a Category 1 hurricane, causing $100 million in damage (1976 USD) and a total of five deaths across the New England region of the United States.
The season began with Subtropical Storm One on May 21, prior to the official start of the season; the bounds of the season are from June 1 to November 30, which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. Tropical Storm Dottie caused flooding rains in Florida that caused a total of four deaths. In early September, Hurricane Emmy caused 68 indirect deaths when a Venezuelan Air Force plane carrying a school choir crashed on a landing attempt at Lajes Air Base in the Azores during the storm.

The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season had the fewest tropical storms since the 1965 season. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical depression of the season developed on June 13, 12 days after the start of the season, in the western Caribbean Sea.

At least 25,000 people were left homeless and 11 fatalities were reported.
In addition to Anita, another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe. The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana, resulting in $10 million (1977 USD) in damage.[tpl]#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1977 USD, unless otherwise noted|group="nb"[/tpl]  After moving inland, it spawned 14 tornadoes throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In addition to Anita and Babe, five other tropical cyclones – hurricanes Clara, Dorothy, and Evelyn, as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine – left only minor impacts on land. Overall, the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11 fatalities and at least $13 million in damage, excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine, which led to 53 deaths and $203 million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States, New Jersey, and New York.

The 1978 Atlantic hurricane season was the last Atlantic hurricane season with an all-female naming list. The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was an above average season due to a subsiding El Niño. The first storm, Subtropical Storm One, developed unusually early – on January 18 – and dissipated five days later without causing any damage. In June and July, two tropical depressions formed, but neither caused many effects, if any, on land. At the end of July and early August, short-lived Tropical Storm Amelia caused extensive flooding in Texas after dropping as much as [tpl]convert|48|in|mm[/tpl] of rain. 
Tropical Storm Bess and Hurricane Cora resulted in only minor land impacts, while the latter was attributed to one fatality. Later in August, Tropical Storm Debra produced widespread effects, though damage was also relatively minor. Hurricane Ella because the northernmost Category 4 hurricane and lashed the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada with gusty winds and rip currents. Hurricanes Flossie and Kendra as well as Tropical Storms Hope, Irma, and Juliet caused minimal land impacts as a tropical cyclone. However, the precursor to Hurricane Kendra caused significant flooding in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Greta caused moderate damage after brushing Honduras and making landfall in Belize. Additionally, it reached the East Pacific and was renamed Olivia. Overall, the storms of this season collectively caused $191 million (1978 USD) in damage and 42 fatalities.

Hurricane Bob, the first male named storm in the Atlantic, caused moderate damage in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Tropical Storm Claudette dropped up to [tpl]convert|45|in|mm[/tpl] of rain in Texas, causing moderate damage from flooding. 
The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane David, a Category 5 hurricane that caused devastation in Dominican Republic, as well as significant impact in the Lesser Antilles and the Southeastern United States. David caused $1.54 billion (1979 USD) in damage and at least 2,068 fatalities. Another significant storm, Hurricane Frederic, resulted in extensive impact, especially in the United States, where it was the costliest tropical cyclone on record, at the time. Tropical Depression Eight, Tropical Storm Elena, Hurricane Henri, an unnumbered tropical depression in September, and Subtropical Storm One all caused minor effects on land. Several of the tropical cyclones also moved in close proximity to land, but impact is unknown. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.27 billion in damage and at least 2,118 deaths.

Sir William Berkeley ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑr|k|l|iː[/tpl]; 1605 – 9 July 1677) was a colonial governor of Virginia, and one of the Lords Proprietors of the Colony of Carolina; he was appointed to these posts by King Charles I of England, of whom he was a favourite.
As proprietor of Green Spring Plantation in James City County, he experimented with activities such as growing silkworms as part of his efforts to expand the tobacco-based economy.
Berkeley enacted friendly policies toward the Native Americans that led to the revolt by some of the planters in 1676 which became known as Bacon's Rebellion. In the aftermath, King Charles II was angered by the retribution exacted against the rebels by Berkeley, and recalled him to England.

[[Ketogenic diet]]
CATEGORIES: Diets, Epilepsy, Low-carb diets, High-fat diets

The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fuelling brain function. However, if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures.
The original therapeutic diet for paediatric epilepsy provides just enough protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories to maintain the correct weight for age and height. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream and butter.
Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.
The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned with the introduction of effective anticonvulsant drugs. In the mid-1990s, Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams, whose son's severe epilepsy was effectively controlled by the diet, created the Charlie Foundation to promote it. Publicity included an appearance on NBC's Dateline programme and ...First Do No Harm (1997), a made-for-television film starring Meryl Streep. The foundation sponsored a multicentre research study, the results of which—announced in 1996—marked the beginning of renewed scientific interest in the diet.
Almost half of children and young people with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. The most common adverse effect is constipation, affecting about 30% of patients - this was due to fluid restriction, which was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.
There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regime, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. Clinical trials and studies in animal models suggest that ketogenic diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying benefits for a number of adult neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2012, there is limited clinical trial data in these areas, and, outside of paediatric epilepsy, use of the ketogenic diet remains at the research stage.

[[Flag of New South Wales]]
CATEGORIES: New South Wales, Flags of Australia

The current state flag of New South Wales was officially adopted by the government of New South Wales in 1876.
The flag is based on the defaced British Blue Ensign with the state badge located in the fly. The badge, based on the coat of arms, is a white disc with the cross of St George, a golden lion passant guardant in the centre of the cross and an eight-pointed gold star on each arm of the cross.
This flag was adopted due to criticisms from the British Admiralty that the previous design was too similar to the design of the Victorian flag.
The state badge was designed by the Colonial Architect James Barnet and Captain Francis Hixson, a retired Royal Navy officer.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.dpc.nsw.gov.au/about_the_department/our_structure/state_protocol/flags_and_emblems|title= New South Wales Flag |accessdate=2008-08-10|year=2007|author=New South Wales Government|work= Flags and Emblems[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Even though no meaning for the design was given, it is perhaps a simplified version of what was the semi-official arms of New South Wales at the time.

[[Am Timan]]
CATEGORIES: Salamat Region, Populated places in Chad

Am Timan is a city in Chad and is the capital of the region of Salamat. In Arabic, Am Timan means "mother of twins," although the reason for the name is not known. As the capital of the prefecture, it has the area's secondary school and a clinic, and hosts the largest market day and holiday celebrations.
During the conflict period, a cotton plantation and processing plant just outside the city were destroyed.
The city's sand airport was upgraded by the French Foreign Legion in 1971 to allow military air transports to supply the anti-rebel effort. At the time, the only practical way in or out of the city was by air.
Since the dry season lasts for about seven months of the year, water becomes a problem as the dry season progresses. Aquifers are accessed by digging deeper and deeper into the bed of the Bahr Salamat (river). The river becomes strong flowing with the onset of rain, however, and the children enjoy swimming in it.

[[James Ling]]

CATEGORIES: 1922 births, 2004 deaths, People from Hugo, Oklahoma, American businesspeople

James "Jimmy" J. Ling (December 31, 1922 – December 17, 2004), from Hugo, Oklahoma, was a US businessman and former head of Ling-Temco-Vought corporation. While at its helm Ling used LTV funds to purchase a large number of corporations, and was one of the more famous of the 1960s conglomerate managers. As with other conglomerates such as ITT, Litton Industries, Teledyne, and Textron, higher interest rates and inflation destroyed LTV in the 1970s.
Ling was the son of a Catholic convert who, in the climate of anti-Catholic bigotry during World War I, killed a fellow railroad worker and later entered a Carmelite monastery. Ling's mother died when he was young, and he lived for a time with an aunt. He failed to graduate from his Jesuit high school but became a master electrician after training at a US Navy school in Mississippi. In 1947 he founded his own Dallas electrical contracting business, Ling Electric Company, where he lived in the rear of the shop. After incorporating and taking his company public in 1955, Ling found innovative ways to market his stock, including door-to-door soliciting and selling from a booth at the State Fair of Texas.
In 1956 Ling bought L.M. Electronics and transformed it into the conglomerate Ling-Temco-Vought. He left the firm in 1975 after antitrust issues arose.  
Ling formed several companies after his time at LTV, but none were as successful.  Ling later recovered from Guillain-Barré syndrome, first diagnosed in 1981.

He was photographed raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima. The leader of the group in the famous picture was Strank, who got the order to climb Mt. Suribachi to lay telephone wire. Accompanying him were Corporal Harlon Block, Pfc Ira Hayes and Pfc Franklin Sousley.  About halfway up the mountain, they were joined by Pfc Rene Gagnon, who was carrying a larger flag to the summit to replace the smaller one which had been raised earlier in the day.  Upon reaching the summit, Strank took the flag from Gagnon, and explained to Lieutenant Harold Schrier that "Colonel Johnson wants this big flag run up high so every son of a bitch on this whole cruddy island can see it."

The Brown Derby was the name of a chain of restaurants in Los Angeles, California. The first and most famous of these was shaped like a man's derby hat, an iconic image that became synonymous with the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was opened by Wilson Mizner.[tpl]cite web | url=http://beniciaherald.me/2013/09/27/the-rogue-and-the-little-lady-the-romance-of-wilson-mizner-and-anita-loos/ | title=The Rogue and the Little Lady: The romance of Wilson Mizner and Anita Loos | publisher=The Bernica Herald | accessdate=January 1, 2014 | author=Rubay, Donnell[/tpl] A chain of Brown Derby restaurants in Ohio are still in business today.
The chain was started by Robert H. Cobb and Herbert Somborn (a former husband of film star Gloria Swanson). It is often incorrectly thought that the Brown Derby was a single restaurant, and the Wilshire Boulevard and Hollywood branches are frequently confused. Gus Girves started the Brown Derby chain in Ohio as Girves Brown Derby in 1941.

This was only the second national nominating convention for the Republican Party.
Other candidates at the convention included former New York Governor William H. Seward, U.S. Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, former U.S. Representative Edward Bates of Missouri, and U.S. Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania.
This primary was notable as every candidate that ran for the Republican nomination eventually became a member of Lincoln's cabinet.
Seward had been the favorite going into the convention, and led on the first two ballots. His lead soon melted away to the dark horse Lincoln, who captured the nomination on the third ballot.  Lincoln's campaign manager, David Davis, was credited with playing a substantial role in the convention outcome.
Lincoln-Hamlin went on to defeat three other major tickets that year, including Democratic nominee Stephen A. Douglas, U.S. Senator from Illinois.

[[Partial agonist]]
CATEGORIES: Pharmacology

In pharmacology, partial agonists are drugs that bind to and activate a given receptor, but have only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. They may also be considered ligands which display both agonistic and antagonistic effects - when both a full agonist and partial agonist are present, the partial agonist actually acts as a competitive antagonist, competing with the full agonist for receptor occupancy and producing a net decrease in the receptor activation observed with the full agonist alone.N. E. Williams and T. N. Calvey (2001). Principles and Practice of Pharmacology for Anaesthetists. Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 0-632-05605-3 Clinically, partial agonists can be used to activate receptors to give a desired submaximal response when inadequate amounts of the endogenous ligand are present, or they can reduce the overstimulation of receptors when excess amounts of the endogenous ligand are present.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhu BT |title=Mechanistic explanation for the unique pharmacologic properties of receptor partial agonists |journal=Biomed. Pharmacother. |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=76–89 |year=2005 |pmid=15795100 |doi=10.1016/j.biopha.2005.01.010[/tpl]
Some currently common drugs that have been classed as partial agonists at particular receptors include
buspirone, aripiprazole, buprenorphine, and norclozapine. Examples of ligands activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma as partial agonists are honokiol and falcarindiol.Atanasov AG, Wang JN, Gu SP, Bu J, Kramer MP, Baumgartner L, Fakhrudin N, Ladurner A, Malainer C, Vuorinen A, Noha SM, Schwaiger S, Rollinger JM, Schuster D, Stuppner H, Dirsch VM, Heiss EH.

This text is variously referred to as the Comma Johanneum, the Johannine Comma, the Heavenly Witnesses, 1 John 5:7 or 1 John v:7.  The question of the authenticity of the verse, with the phrase:
has been a major subject of debate from the 1500s to today.  The debate on 1 John 5:7 has also been a primary focus of discussions on the integrity of the New Testament documents and scribal fealty to the Bible text. The varying doctrinal and Christological interpretations of the verse have been a major part of these debates.

[[Lai]]

CATEGORIES: Lais, Medieval music, French poetry, Song forms

A lai (or lay lyrique, "lyric lay", to distinguish it from a lai breton) is a lyrical, narrative poem written in octosyllabic couplets that often deals with tales of adventure and romance. Lais were mainly composed in  France and Germany, during the 13th and 14th centuries. The English term 
lay is a 13th-century loan from Old French lai. The origin of the French term itself is unclear, perhaps it is itself a loan from German Leich (reflected in archaic or dialectal English lake, "sport, play").The terms note, nota and notula (as used by Johannes de Grocheio) appear to be have been synonyms for lai.
The poetic form of the lai usually has several stanzas, none of which have the same form. As a result, the accompanying music consists of sections which do not repeat.  This distinguishes the lai from other common types of musically important verse of the period (for example, the rondeau and the ballade). Towards the end of its development in the 14th century, some lais repeat stanzas, but usually only in the longer examples. There is one very late example of a lai, written to mourn the defeat of the French at the Battle of Agincourt (1415), (Lay de la guerre, by Pierre de Nesson) but no music for it survives.
There are four lais in the Roman de Fauvel, all of them anonymous. The lai reached its highest level of development as a musical and poetic form in the work of Guillaume de Machaut; 19 separate lais by this 14th-century ars nova composer survive, and they are among his most sophisticated and highly-developed secular compositions.

Television, English-language television programming, Animated duos, 2000s animated television series, Cartoon Network programs, Fictional twins

The Cramp Twins is a British/Canadian/American animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny) and Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie), not-so identical twin brothers who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucien's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Jayne Peterson) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen, who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).
The Season 1 premiered in the United Kingdom in September 2001 on Cartoon Network UK and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC and BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children; the season ended on 21 June 2002. The Season 2 premiered in Summer 2003 and finished in Autumn of the same year. The Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. The Season 4 (also finale) began in 2006 and ended that same year but still airing in the UK. The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network. It also showed in some parts of Africa.
The show was originally cancelled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka Tokyo Mew Mew) was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with The Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

[[SmarTrip]]
CATEGORIES: Fare collection systems in the United States, Contactless smart cards, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority

SmarTrip is a contact-less stored-value smart card payment system managed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Unlike traditional paper farecards or bus passes, SmarTrip is designed to be permanent and reloadable. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) uses a compatible payment system called CharmCard. A reciprocity agreement between the MTA and WMATA allows either card to be used for travel on any of the participating transit systems in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area.
WMATA began using SmarTrip for payment on Metrorail in 1999 followed shortly by Metrobus and Metro parking lots. It was later extended to other public transit systems throughout the region. SmarTrip users receive discounts on Metrorail and Metrobus fares. Although WMATA initially drew criticism due to the limited number of SmarTrip sales locations, distribution has expanded to local convenience stores and supermarkets. By late 2012 all Metrorail stations were equipped with SmarTrip vending machines.[tpl]cite news |title=All Metro stations now have SmarTrip vending machines |first=Luz |last=Lazo |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/all-metro-stations-now-have-smartrip-vending-machines/2012/11/06/8981778e-284c-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2012-11-06[/tpl]
In October 2010, WMATA announced that it was working on a replacement system because the company that makes SmarTrip cards has since gone out of business. However, the transit agency found an alternate manufacturer to produce additional cards until a new payment system is introduced.[tpl]cite news|last=Weir|first=Kytja|title=Metro to get new, cheaper SmarTrip cards this fall|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/transportation/2012/05/metro-get-new-cheaper-smartrip-cards-fall/663481|accessdate=29 May 2012|newspaper=Washington Examiner|date=28 May 2012[/tpl]

[[Seebeck coefficient]]
CATEGORIES: Thermodynamics, Electricity

The Seebeck coefficient (also known as thermopower,Thermopower is a misnomer as this quantity does not actually express a power quantity: Note that the unit of thermopower (V/K) is different from the unit of power (watts). thermoelectric power, and thermoelectric sensitivity) of a material is a measure of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across that material, as induced by the Seebeck effect.Concepts in Thermal Physics, by Katherine M. Blundell Weblink through Google books The SI unit of the Seebeck coefficient is volts per kelvin (V/K), although it is more often given in microvolts per kelvin (μV/K).
The use of materials with a high Seebeck coefficient is one of many important factors for the efficient behaviour of thermoelectric generators and thermoelectric coolers. More information about high-performance thermoelectric materials can be found in the Thermoelectric materials article. In thermocouples the Seebeck effect is used to measure temperatures, and for accuracy it is desirable to use materials with a Seebeck coefficient that is stable over time.
Physically, the magnitude and sign of the Seebeck coefficient can be approximately understood as being given by the entropy per unit charge carried by electrical currents in the material. It may be positive or negative. In conductors that can be understood in terms of independently moving, nearly-free charge carriers, the Seebeck coefficient is negative for negatively charged carriers (such as electrons), and positive for positively charged carriers (such as electron holes).

[[Television special]]
CATEGORIES: Television specials, Television terminology

A television special is a television program which interrupts or temporarily  programming normally scheduled for a given time slot. Sometimes, however, the term is given to a telecast of a theatrical film, such as The Wizard of Oz, which is not part of a regular television anthology series such as NBC Saturday Night at the Movies (1961–1978).
The term originally applied especially to major dramatized presentations of an hour or two which were broadcast during times normally occupied by episodes of one or more weekly television series, thus replacing the series for that specific week. In the 1960s, multi-part specials, over several days in a week, or on the same day for several weeks, evolved from this format, though these were more commonly called miniseries. The term "TV special" formerly applied more to dramas or musicals presented live or on videotape (such as Peter Pan) than to filmed presentations especially made for television, which were (and still are) designated as made-for-TV movies.  
Other forms of TV specials are one-time comedy or musical events, one-shot seasonal programs (e.g. Christmas television specials), irregular sports events (e.g. the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl), live coverage of a popular cultural event (such as the Academy Awards or Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade) or spontaneous interruptions of active programming to cover an important news event (election coverage, however, is generally scheduled).
Today, with the rise of cable, online streaming, and home video, it is virtually impossible for an annual telecast of a program to have the same impact on television as before. In pre-cable and pre-home video days, audiences often had to wait an entire year (or sometimes longer) to rewatch a television special that had a great impact on first viewing. Online streaming makes it possible for viewers to watch a television show again only one day after it has aired, and videocassettes and DVD's make it possible for the general public to own copies of television shows.

The Calgary Tower is a 191-metre (626 feet) free standing observation tower in Downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Originally called the Husky Tower, it was conceived as a joint venture between Marathon Realty Company Limited and Husky Oil as part of an urban renewal plan and to celebrate Canada's centennial of 1967. The tower was built at a cost of $3,500,000 and weighs approximately 10,900 tonnes, of which 60% is below ground.  It opened to the public on June 30, 1968 as the tallest structure in Calgary, and the tallest in Canada outside of Toronto.  It was renamed the Calgary Tower in 1971.
The building was a founding member of the World Federation of Great Towers.

Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 10 in E-flat major is a hypothetical work, assembled by Barry Cooper from Beethoven's fragmentary sketches. This title is controversial since it cannot be proven that all the sketches assembled were meant for the same piece. There is, however, consensus that Beethoven did intend another symphony.

The Constitution of 24 June 1793Crowe, Michael Bertram. 1977. The Changing Profile of the Natural Law. P.243 ([tpl]lang-fr|Acte constitutionnel du 24 juin 1793[/tpl]), also known as the Constitution of the Year I, or the The Montagnard ConstitutionGupta, Madan Gopal. 1963. Government of the Fifth Republic of France. P.16  (French: Constitution montagnarde), was the constitution instated by the Montagnards and by popular referendum under the First Republic during the French Revolution. Drafted by the Committee of Public Safety which was enlarged with the purpose of producing it, the text was presented to the National Convention on 10 June and subsequently accepted by that body on 24 June 1793. The constitution was then ratified by a popular referendum employing universal male suffrage, following approval by 1,784,377 out of approximately 1,800,000 voters.Pertue, M., "Constitution de 1793," in Soboul, A., Ed. "Dictionnaire historique de la Revolution francaise," p.283, Quadrige/PUF, Paris: 2005. The Convention found in the external and internal state of war sufficient reason to maintain itself until peace and postponed the Constitution's implementation. Though the Constitution was overwhelmingly popular and its drafting and ratification buoyed popular support for the Montagnards, the convention set it aside indefinitely on 10 October 1793 and declared a "Revolutionary Government" until a future peace.Kennedy, M. L. "The Jacobin Clubs in the French Revolution: 1793-1795," p.53. Berghahn Books, New York: 2000.
The Constitution was inspired by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, to which it added several rights: it proclaimed the superiority of popular sovereignty over national sovereignty; various economic and social rights (right of association, right to work and public assistance, right to public education); the right of rebellion (and duty to rebel when the government violates the right of the people); and the abolition of slavery written in what is known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793.
It was eventually supplanted by the French Constitution of 1795, which established the Directory. The revolutionaries of 1848 were inspired by this constitution and that it passed into the ideological armory of the Third Republic (founded 1870). It represents a fundamental historical document, that contributed much to the later democratic institutions and developments.

The Constitution of 22 August 1795 (also known as the Constitution of the Year III, or the Constitution of 5 Fructidor) was a national constitution of France ratified by the National Convention on 22 August 1795 (5 Fructidor of the Year III under the French Revolutionary Calendar) during the French Revolution. It established the Directory, and remained in effect until the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) effectively ended the Revolution and began the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was more conservative than the abortive democratic French Constitution of 1793. The Constitution of 1795 established a liberal republic with a franchise based on the payment of taxes, similar to that of the French Constitution of 1791; a bicameral legislature, (Council of Ancients, and  a Council of 500) to slow down the legislative process; and a five-man Directory. The central government retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press and freedom of association. The Declaration of Rights and Duties of Mankind at the beginning of the constitution included an explicit ban on slavery.  It was succeeded by the Constitution of the Year VIII, which established the Consulate.

Lake Sevan ([tpl]lang-hy|Սևանա լիճ[/tpl] Sevana lič) is the largest lake in Armenia and the Caucasus region. It is one of the largest fresh-water high-altitude lakes in the world. 
Lake Sevan is situated in the central part of the Republic of Armenia, inside the Gegharkunik Province, at the altitude of [tpl]convert|1,900|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The total surface area of its basin is about [tpl]convert|5,000|km2|abbr=on[/tpl], the lake itself is 940 km2, and the volume is 34.0 billion cubic metres. It is fed by 28 rivers and streams. Only 10% of the outgoing water is drained by the Hrazdan (Razdan) river, while the remaining 90% evaporates. 
Before human intervention dramatically changed the Lake Sevan ecosystem, the lake was [tpl]convert|95|m|ft[/tpl] deep, covered an area of 1,360 km² (5% of Armenia's entire area), had a volume of 58 km³ and had a perimeter of 260 km. The lake surface was at an altitude of 1,916 m above sea level.
Along with Lake Van and Lake Urmia, Sevan was considered one of the three great lakes of the historical Armenian Kingdom, collectively referred to as the Seas of Armenia; it is the only one within the boundaries of today's Republic of Armenia. The Sevanavank peninsula (formerly an island) is the historic area of the lake at its northern shores.

It will require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the current global Internet traffic.http://www.skatelescope.org/PDF/brochure/SKA_Brochure_2010.pdf, The Square Kilometre Array, p.24 It will be able to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than ever before.
With receiving stations extending out to distance of at least 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) from a concentrated central core, it will exploit radio astronomy's ability to provide the highest resolution images in all astronomy. The SKA will be built in the southern hemisphere, in Sub-Saharan states with cores in South Africa and Australia, where the view of the Milky Way Galaxy is best and radio interference least.
With a budget of about €1.5 billion, construction of the SKA is scheduled to begin in 2018 for initial observations by 2020 and full operation by 2025.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/news/2nd-april-news/ |title=SKA announces Founding Board and selects Jodrell Bank Observatory to host Project Office |publisher=SKA Organisation |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |title=The project timeline |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=14 April 2011[/tpl] The headquarters of the project are in Manchester, in the UK.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.skatelescope.org/the-organisation/ |title=The organisation |publisher=SKA Organisation[/tpl]

Demerara ([tpl]lang-nl|Demerary[/tpl]) is a historical region in the Guianas on the north coast of South America which is now part of the country of Guyana.  It was a Dutch colony until 1815 and a county of British Guiana from 1838 to 1966.  It was located about the lower courses of the Demerara River, and its main town was Georgetown.
The name "Demerara" comes from a variant of the Arawak word "Immenary" or "Dumaruni" which means "river of the letter wood".[tpl]cite journal | title = Guyana the Name | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20080501041629/http://www.guyana.ro/guyana/name.php | journal = Thunder | date = 1962-06-30 | location = Georgetown, Guyana | last = Benn | first = Brindley H.

[[Jama'at al-Muslimin]]
CATEGORIES: Jihadist organizations, Islamic terrorism, European Union designated terrorist organizations, Rebel groups in Egypt

Jama'at al-Muslimin (Society of Muslims), popularly known as Takfir wal-Hijra (Arabic تكفير والهجرة, English "Excommunication and Exodus", alternately "excommunication and emigration" or "anathema and exile"), was a radical Sunni Islamist group led by Shukri Mustafa, which emerged in Egypt in the 1960s as an offshoot of Muslim Brotherhood, inspired by Sayyid Qutb.
The group was crushed by the Egyptian government after it kidnapped and murdered Muhammad al-Dhahabi, a former government minister and Muslim scholar. Despite this, some believe its ideology of separation from Muslim society, "Takfir wal-Hijra", lives on in other groups.Bruce Livesey, "Takfir wal-Hijra," pbs.org (January 25, 2005).

[[Tanunda Liedertafel]]
CATEGORIES: Australian choirs, Culture of South Australia, Musical groups established in 1861

Tanunda Liedertafel 1861 is a 55-member male choir in Tanunda, South Australia. Drawing its four-part (TTBB) singing material from traditional popular German culture, the group's origins may date back at least to 1861, based on a surviving music book case with the words Tanunda Liedertafel 1861 painted on its metal lid.
The choir was re-organized in 1920 and, aside from an interruption caused by World War II has been active ever since, primarily in Tanunda and Adelaide. Along with third- and fourth-generation German-Australians, the group includes singers with Dutch, British, Polish and Irish backgrounds. Given the nationalities of the members, nearly 50 percent of the material sung is in English or Latin (where tradition dictates).
Many of their performances are for charity. An annual event is the Kaffee Abend in mid-November (October 2013 being the only known exception).
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has recorded the Liedertafel several times since 1932. The choir first performed on television in 1961 for its centenary. It has also appeared on programs broadcast in Germany. 
In 1963, Tanunda Liedertafel performed for Queen Elizabeth II in Elder Park, Adelaide. In 2001 it performed in Adelaide for US President Bill Clinton.
Awards have included the Zelter Plaque (1980).
The choir also attends Sangerfest(s), this is where groups of choirs (similar to the Tanunda Liedertafel) come together for a weekend of traditional German and Austrian song. The next Sagerfest will be held in Canberra, Australia in October 2014.
Practices are held for two hours each Tuesday night, at The Tanunda Institute (Tanunda Galley) eleven months out of the year (although members are no longer fined three pence for tardiness, or six pence for non-attendance).

[[Hazel Grouse]]

CATEGORIES: Grouse, Animals described in 1758, Birds of Ukraine

The Hazel Grouse or Hazel Hen (Tetrastes bonasia) is one of the smaller members of the grouse family of birds. It is a sedentary species, breeding across northern Eurasia as far east as Hokkaido, and as far west as central and eastern Europe, in dense, damp, mixed coniferous woodland, preferably with some spruce.
The nest is on the ground, and 3–6 eggs is the normal clutch size. The female takes all responsibility for incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks, as is typical with gamebirds.
This is a relatively small grouse at [tpl]convert|35|-|39|cm[/tpl] length. The plumage of this plump bird is finely patterned, but Hazel Grouse essentially has grey upperparts, brown wings and chestnut flecked white underparts.
The male has a short erectile crest and a white-bordered black throat. The female has a shorter crest and lacks the black throat. In flight, this species shows a black-tipped grey tail.
The male has a high-pitched ti-ti-ti-ti-ti call, and the female a liquid tettettettettet. The calls, or the burr of the flying birds' wings, are often the only indication of this grouse's presence, since its shyness and dense woodland habitat make it difficult to see.
This bird feeds on the ground, taking mainly plant food, supplemented by insects when breeding.

Kasdi Merbah (April 16, 1938 – August 21, 1993) ([tpl]lang-ar|قاصدي مرباح[/tpl]) was the prime minister of Algeria from November 5, 1988 until September 9, 1989. 
He was a member of the FLN, which ruled the country at that time.  He was assassinated on August 21, 1993.
During the seventies and early eighties, he was the head of the security services (sécurité militaire). Before the 1988 uprisings, he had been minister twice : of agriculture and then of public health. Following the aforementioned uprisings, he constituted his own party known by its acronym "Madjd" (meaning "glory" in Arabic). Merbah appeared to be a very moderate politician and tried (secretly and overtly) to help in finding a solution for the crisis that erupted in 1992 following the interruption of the electoral process - the FIS having won almost the majority of the parliamentary seats in the first round of the first pluralistic legislative elections (Dec. 1991) in Algeria. A great number of analysts attribute his assassination to his past in the security services and the many state secrets he possessed, beside the apparent moderate posture he had adopted with regard to dealing with the Islamist movements, particularly the FIS who went for the armed option.

CATEGORIES: 1944 births, Living people, People from Dallas, Texas, Post-Keynesian economists, Johns Hopkins University faculty, University of Missouri–Kansas City faculty, Tallinn University of Technology faculty

Jan A. Kregel (born 19 April 1944) is an eminent Post-Keynesian economist.
Kregel has served since 2006 as Professor of Finance and Development at Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia. He is an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS (SAIS), whose Bologna Center he co-directed in the late 1980s, and a visiting professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City. He is also one of the Senior Scholars at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.  Until 2007, he was Chief of the Policy Analysis and Development Branch of the Financing for Development Office of United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Until 2004, he was High Level Expert in International Finance and Macroeconomics in the New York Liaison Office of UNCTAD, being in essence its chief economist. For many years, he held the Chair for Political Economy at the University of Bologna.
Kregel studied mainly at the University of Cambridge (with Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor) and Rutgers University (Ph.D. 1970 under supervision of Paul Davidson). He is a Life Fellow of the Royal Economic Society in London and in 2000 he co-founded The Other Canon, a center and network for heterodox economics research, with main founder and executive chairman Erik Reinert.http://www.othercanon.org/board/index.html
"In the 1970-75 period, Professor Kregel was concerned with synthesis, integration and delineation of a Post Keynesian methodology and paradigm. From the mid-1970s until the late 1980s, he worked on the analysis of decision making under uncertainty, on formation of asset prices and on Keynes analysis of Chapter 17 of the General Theory. In 1988, Professor Kregel showed that Keynes’ liquidity preference and own rate analysis were actually two sides of the theory of effective demand. His most recent works on price formation and market structure provide a powerful critique of neoclassical price theory and propose a Keynesian alternative in which expectations of the future go into the determination of current price determination and in which institutional arrangements undergird the process of price formation." (University of Missouri in Kansas City)

[[Adjustable Ranging Telescope]]
CATEGORIES: Firearm sights

Developed and patented by James M. Leatherwood, the Adjustable Ranging Telescope (ART) system combines a rangefinding scale inside the telescopic sight (scope) with an adjustable cam built into the scope's mount that raises or lowers the rear of the sight to compensate for the trajectory of the bullet.  The cam is preset for a specific cartridge; i.e. the 7.62 mm NATO round.  In use, the shooter first adjusts the magnification of the scope such that the ranging brackets subtend the target. Since the range cam is locked to the magnification ring, the range is automatically set and the drop of the shot is accounted for. This then allows the shooter to place the scope's aiming point directly on the target without having to hold over or under to compensate for the bullet's rise and fall.
During the Vietnam War, the United States Army found that they desperately needed snipers.  They were losing troops to enemy snipers and had no capability of retaliating in kind.  Their major problem was that the classic training of a sniper in range estimation, ballistics, compensation for weather or climate variables, and precision shooting is a lengthy process and they didn't have the time.  About this time, Lieutenant Leatherwood, who already had the patents for his ART system, entered the Army and began working with U.S. Army Ordnancehttp://www.goordnance.apg.army.mil/Default.htm specialists.  The combination of the Leatherwood ART with M14 National Match rifles to produce what became the M21 Sniper Rifle, allowed the Army to place competent snipers in the field with all line units.
Modern "civilian" versions of this system are sold by Leatherwood Optics and a more detailed Manual of the scope and its mounting system are available there.

[[Quantum Effect Devices]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct semiconductor companies of the United States, Companies established in 1991, Companies disestablished in 2000

Quantum Effect Devices (QED) was a microprocessor design company incorporated in 1991 as Quantum Effect Design. The three founders, Tom Riordan, Earl Killian and Ray Kunita, were senior managers at MIPS Computer Systems Inc.. They left MIPS at a time when the company was having a difficult time selling entire computer systems (MIPS Magnum) instead of concentrating on building microprocessor chips which was MIPS' original mission. Soon after, SGI purchased MIPS. IDT was a major funder and customer for the initial QED design.
The original product plan for QED was to build a MIPS microprocessor for a laptop computer. This was during the ACE initiative from Microsoft to support multiple RISC architectures for their new Windows NT operating system. System companies like DeskStation Technology and board companies like ShaBLAMM! Computer were building products in the hope that RISC-based personal computers would become mainstream. While that market never materialized, the first product, the R4600 "Orion" microprocessor, proved to be successful in several embedded markets such as networking routers and arcade games. Subsequent projects were designed for companies such as Toshiba and IDT (R4700), IDT & NKK (R4650), SGI and NEC (R5000).
The PowerPC 603q was a PowerPC microprocessor designed for Motorola, meant for Apple Computer's home PC and game machine designs. Neither of these designs were productized, so the PowerPC 603q never reached full production.
Several years later, in an attempt to increase product revenue, the company transformed itself to a product company selling its own line of MIPS microprocessors. At that time, the company changed its name to Quantum Effect Devices. After successful products introductions like the RM5200 and the RM7000, under its own "RISCMark" label, the company had its IPO on 1 February 2000. The initial stock price of $16 jumped to $56.50 on the first day of trading. The company was acquired by PMC-Sierra on October 2000; at the time, Quantum Effect Devices was valued in a stock swap worth $2.3 billion according to one estimate. The company became the Microprocessor Products Division of PMC. The acquisition was done by stock exchange and was valued at $2.3 billion. The team completed the RM9x00 product line while at PMC, but that product line was not successful in the marketplace. Most of the microprocessor core development team derived from QED was laid off as a group by PMC-Sierra in June 2005; the last few were laid off in January 2006.
The company name was attributed to Tom Riordan. He believed that the company would survive to the age when semiconductor geometry dimensions would become so small that quantum effects would dominate circuit behavior.

In 1963, she was only the second woman to ever serve as a federal Cabinet Minister. Under Prime Minister Lester Pearson's minority governments of the middle and late 1960s, she helped push through the legislation that created the Canada Pension Plan and Medicare. As Secretary of State, she was in charge of Canada's Centennial celebrations in 1967. After leaving politics in 1968, she wrote three books, and had her own radio show on CBC Radio. She was stricken with pancreatic cancer in 1979 and was given the Order of Canada at her hospital bed.  She died a few days short of the 20th anniversary of her first political election victory, in 1980.

[[Hubba Bubba]]
CATEGORIES: 1979 introductions, Chewing gum, Wrigley Company brands

Hubba Bubba is a brand of bubble gum originally produced by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wrigley.com/global/brands/hubba-bubba.aspx | title=Hubba Bubba | publisher=Wrigley.com | accessdate=June 8, 2012[/tpl] in the United States in 1979 but more recently produced in countries around the world. The bubble gum got its name by the phrase "Hubba Hubba" that World War II soldiers used to express approval.http://www.oldtimecandy.com/hubba-bubba-gum.htm  The main gimmick used to promote the gum is that Hubba Bubba is less sticky than other brands of bubble gum and so burst bubbles are easier to peel from your skin. The first portions of Hubba Bubba were  produced in the traditional bubble gum flavor often referred to as Original, but different flavors of gum have been produced around the world. Many, but not all, of these flavors are  based on fruit. Hubba Bubba products also include many flavors of soda, bubble gum and squeeze pouches.

[[Locus of control]]
CATEGORIES: Control (social and political), Social psychology, Cognitive biases, Personal life, Motivation

In personality psychology, locus of control refers to the extent to which individuals believe that they can control events that affect them. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's "locus" (Latin for "place" or "location") is conceptualized as either internal (the person believes they can control their life) or external (meaning they believe that their decisions and life are controlled by environmental factors which they cannot influence, or by chance or fate).Rotter, J. B. (1966). Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement: Psychological Monographs: General & Applied 80(1) 1966, 1-28.
Individuals with a high internal locus of control believe that events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving test results, people with 
an internal locus of control would tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities, whereas people with an external locus of control would tend to praise or blame an external factor such as the teacher or the test.Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour - 4th Canadian ed.. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.
Locus of control has generated much research in a variety of areas in psychology, and the construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology and clinical psychology. Debate continues about whether specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.
Locus of control is one of the four dimensions of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem.

[[Granularity]]
CATEGORIES: Statistical mechanics, Business terms

Granularity is the extent to which a system is broken down into small parts, either the system itself or its description or observation.  It is the extent to which a larger entity is subdivided. For example, a yard broken into inches has finer granularity than a yard broken into feet.
Coarse-grained systems consist of fewer, larger components than fine-grained systems; a coarse-grained description of a system regards large subcomponents while a fine-grained description regards smaller components of which the larger ones are composed.
The terms granularity, coarse, and fine are relative, used when comparing systems or descriptions of systems.  An example of increasingly fine granularity: a list of nations in the United Nations, a list of all states/provinces in those nations, a list of all cities in those states, etc.
The terms fine and coarse are used consistently across fields, but the term granularity itself is not. For example, in investing, more granularity refers to more positions of smaller size, while photographic film that is more granular has fewer and larger chemical "grains".

[[Central heating]]

CATEGORIES: Plumbing, Residential heating

A central heating system provides warmth to the whole interior of a building (or portion of a building) from one point to multiple rooms. When combined with other systems in order to control the building climate, the whole system may be an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system.
Central heating differs from local heating in that the heat generation occurs in one place, such as a furnace room in a house or a mechanical room in a large building (though not necessarily at the "central" geometric point). The most common method of heat generation involves the combustion of fossil fuel in a furnace or boiler. The resultant heat then gets distributed: typically by forced-air through ductwork, by water circulating through pipes, or by steam fed through pipes. Increasingly, buildings utilize solar-powered heat sources, in which case the distribution system normally uses water circulation.
In much of the temperate climate zone, most new housing has come with central heating installed since the Second World War, at least. Such areas normally use gas heaters, district heating, or oil-fired system, often using forced-air systems.  Steam-heating systems, fired by coal, oil or gas, are also used, primarily for larger buildings. Electrical heating systems occur less commonly and are practical only with low-cost electricity or when ground source heat pumps are used. Considering the combined system of central generating plant and electric resistance heating, the overall efficiency will be less than for direct use of fossil fuel for space heating.[tpl]fact|date=June 2012[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Korean martial arts

Korean martial arts (Hangul: 무술 or 무예, Hanja: 武術 or 武藝) are military practices and methods which have their place in the history of Korea but have been adapted for use by both military and non-military personnel as a method of personal growth or recreation. Among the best recognized Korean practices using weapons are traditional Korean Archery and Kumdo, the Korean sword sport similar to Japanese Kendo. The best known unarmed Korean Martial Arts Taekwondo and Hapkido though such traditional practices such as ssireum -  Korean Wrestling - and taekkyeon - Korean Foot Fighting - are rapidly gaining in popularity both inside and outside of the country. In November 2011, Taekkyeon was recognized by UNESCO and placed on its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00452 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2014-02-19[/tpl]  There has also been a revival of traditional Korean swordsmanship arts as well as knife fighting and archery.

[[Rebranding]]
CATEGORIES: Types of branding, Branding companies, Marketing techniques

Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, or combination thereof is created for an established brand with the intention of developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, and competitors.Muzellec, L. and Lambkin, M. C. 2006. Corporate Rebranding: the art of destroying, transferring and recreating brand equity?. European Journal Of Marketing, 40, 7/8, pp803-824Corporate rebranding: impact on brand equity Often, this involves radical changes to a brand's logo, name, image, marketing strategy, and advertising themes. Such changes typically aim to reposition the brand/company, occasionally to distance itself from negative connotations of the previous branding, or to move the brand upmarket; they may also communicate a new message a new board of directors wishes to communicate.
Rebranding can be applied to new products, mature products, or even products still in development. The process can occur intentionally through a deliberate change in strategy or occur unintentionally from unplanned, emergent situations, such as a "Chapter 11 corporate restructuring," "union busting," or "bankruptcy."

[[Yevonde Middleton]]
CATEGORIES: 1893 births, 1975 deaths, English photographers, Women photographers

Yevonde Cumbers Middleton (5 January 1893 – 22 December 1975) was an English photographer, who pioneered the use of colour in portrait photography. She used the professional name Madame Yevonde.[tpl]cite web|title=Madame Yevonde Be Original or Die exhibition|url=http://collection.britishcouncil.org/artist/artist/5/17933/object/0|publisher=British Council|accessdate=16 October 2012|year=1998[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.benhamgallery.com/artists/yevonde.html |title= The Work of Madame Yevonde | publisher= Benham Gallery [/tpl]
Educated at the liberal and progressive Lingholt Boarding School in Hindhead and subsequently at the Guilde Internationale in Paris, as well as boarding schools in Belgium and France, from an early age Yevonde Cumbers displayed an independent attitude. Her heroine was women's liberationist Mary Wollstonecraft, and she joined the Suffragette movement in 1910. Upon leaving school, she returned to the family home in Bromley, Kent, and became active in suffragette activities, but realising that she was not cut out to be a leader in that field, she soon became bored with it. Instead she sought, and was given, a three-year apprenticeship with the portrait photographer Lallie Charles. With the technical grounding she received from working with Charles, and a gift of £250 from her father, at the age of 21 Yevonde set up her own studio at 92 Victoria Street, London, and began to make a name for herself by inviting well-known figures to sit for free. Before long her pictures were appearing in society magazines such as the Tatler and the Sketch. Her style quickly moved away from the stiff "pouter pigeon" look of Lallie Charles, toward a still formal, but more creative, style. Her subjects were often pictured looking away from the camera, and she began using props to creative effect.
By 1921 Madame Yevonde had become a well-known and respected portrait photographer, and moved to larger premises at 100 Victoria Street. Here she began taking advertising commissions and also photographed many of the leading personalities of the day, including A.A. Milne, Barbara Cartland, Diana Mitford, Louis Mountbatten and Noël Coward.
In the early 1930s, Yevonde began experimenting with colour photography, using the new Vivex colour process from Colour Photography Limited of Willesden. The introduction of colour photography was not universally popular; indeed photographers and public alike were so used to black-and-white pictures that early reaction to the new process tended toward the hostile. Yevonde, however, was hugely enthusiastic about it and spent countless hours in her studio experimenting with how to get the best results. Her dedication paid huge dividends. In 1932 she put on an exhibition of portrait work at the Albany Gallery, half monochrome and half colour, to enthusiastic reviews.
In 1933 Madame Yevonde moved once again, to 28 Berkeley Square. She began using colour in her advertising work as well as her portraits, and took on other commissions too. In 1936 she was commissioned by Fortune magazine to photograph the last stages in the fitting out of the new Cunard liner, the Queen Mary. This was very different from Yevonde's usual work, but the shoot was a success. People printed twelve plates, and pictures were exhibited in London and New York. One of the portraits was of artist Doris Zinkeisen who was commissioned together with her sister Anna to paint several murals for the Queen Mary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?sText=doris&search=ss&OConly=true&firstRun=true&LinkID=mp10367&page=1&rNo=1&role=sit|title=Doris Clare Zinkeisen|publisher=National Portrait Gallery (London)|accessdate=20 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=1675482006 |title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women - The Zinkeisen sisters - GREAT SCOTSWOMEN|last=DWYER|first=BRITTA C.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807062115/http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=1675482006 |archivedate = 7 August 2007[/tpl] Another major coup was being invited to take portraits of leading peers to mark the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.
Yevonde's most famous work was inspired by a theme party held on 5 March 1935, where guests dressed as Roman and Greek gods and goddesses. Yevonde subsequently took studio portraits of many of the participants (and others), in appropriate costume and surrounded by appropriate objects. This series of prints showed Yevonde at her most creative, using colour, costume and props to build an otherworldly air around her subjects. She went on to produce further series based on the signs of the zodiac and the months of the year. Partly influenced by surrealist artists, particularly Man Ray, Yevonde used surprising juxtapositions of objects which displayed her sense of humour.
This highly creative period of Yevonde's career would only last a few years. At the end of 1939, Colour Photographs Ltd closed, and the Vivex process was no more. It was the second major blow to Yevonde that year—her husband, the playwright Edgar Middleton, had died in April. Yevonde returned to working in black and white, and produced many notable portraits. She continued working up until her death, just two weeks short of her 83rd birthday, but is chiefly remembered for her  work of the 1930s, which did much to make colour photography respectable.

[[Adobe Photoshop Elements]]
CATEGORIES: Adobe Photoshop, Raster graphics editors, Mac OS software, Windows graphics-related software, OS X graphics-related software, 1999 software, Shareware

Adobe Photoshop Elements is a raster graphics editor for hobbyists and consumers. It contains most of the features of the professional version but with fewer and simpler options. The program allows users to create, edit, organize and share images. It is a successor of Adobe Photoshop LE.
Originally introduced alongside Adobe Photoshop version 6, Photoshop Elements targets photography enthusiasts and thus lacks many features that make it useful in a proper print production environment.[tpl]cite journal | last = Barkey | first = Jonathan| |title = Editor's Choice 3.0: Software | journal = American Photo | volume = 12 | issue = 4| page = 92 | publisher = Hachette Filipacchi Magazines | date = July 2001 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BJohcG6y9csC&pg=PA92| issn = 1046-8986[/tpl] For example, Photoshop Elements cannot export files in the CMYK color mode, supports a simplified color management system, and excludes detailed soft-proofing. It also includes a limited set of Photoshop plugins, and instead has a number of features aimed at non-experts (such as removing the red-eye effect or changing the skin tone in a picture). An example of a redesigned feature would be the Variations correction dialog. Some versions can, however, open, edit, and save PDFs.[tpl]Which|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Emilio Salgari ([tpl]IPA-it|eˈmiljo salˈɡari[/tpl], but often erroneously pronounced [tpl]IPA-it|ˈsalɡari|[/tpl]; 21 August 1862 – 25 April 1911) was an Italian writer of action adventure swashbucklers and a pioneer of science fiction.
For over a century, his novels were mandatory reading for generations of youth eager for exotic adventures. In Italy, his extensive body of work was more widely read than that of Dante.  Today he is still among the 40 most translated Italian authors. Many of his most popular novels have been adapted as comics, animated series and feature films. He is considered the father of Italian adventure fiction and Italian pop culture, and the "grandfather" of the Spaghetti Western.Giovanni Arpino, Emilio Salgari, il padre degli eroi, Mondadori 1991

Hatfield College is a college of Durham University in England. Founded in 1846 by the Rev. David Melville, it was the second college to be associated with the university, after University College (founded 1832). The college was originally called Bishop Hatfield's Hall. It is named after Thomas Hatfield, Prince-Bishop of Durham from 1345 to 1381. The college's founder pioneered the idea of catered residences for students which would later evolve to the now common practice of student residences.
Hatfield College occupies a large site above the River Wear on North Bailey next to Durham Cathedral on the World Heritage Site peninsula. The buildings are an eclectic blend of 17th century halls, early Victorian buildings and major additions during the last century. The college's entrance is via a gateway from North Bailey. The college boathouse is situated within the grounds, as is the Victorian college chapel.
The current Master of the college is Tim Burt, Professor of Geography at Durham University.

[[Glucosamine]]
CATEGORIES: Hexosamines, Dietary supplements

Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of the polysaccharides chitosan and chitin, which compose the exoskeletons of crustaceans and other arthropods, as well as the cell walls of fungi and many higher organisms. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. It is produced commercially by the hydrolysis of crustacean exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.devanutrition.com/easyfaq/cat/Glucosamine-Hcl/63.html|title=Vegan Glucosamine FAQ|accessdate=2010-12-08[/tpl] In the US it is one of the most common non-vitamin, non-mineral, dietary supplements used by adults.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007|date=December 10, 2008|publisher=National Center for Health Statistics|accessdate=2009-08-16[/tpl]

[[Weaving (mythology)]]
CATEGORIES: Comparative mythology, Weaving, Mythemes

The theme of weaving in mythology is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art.  In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, weaving is a mystery within woman's sphere.  Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role:Kathy M'Closky, "Trading is a whiter man's game: the appropriation of women's weaving," in Sally Cole and Lynne Phillips, eds., Ethnographic Feminisms: Essays in Anthropology (Ottawa: Carleton University Press) 1996:97–118 among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. Herodotus noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.Herodotus, 2.35.
Weaving begins with spinning.  Until the spinning wheel was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with distaff and spindle. In English the "distaff side"  indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy.  In Scandinavia, the stars of Orion's belt are known as Friggjar rockr, "Frigg’s distaff".
The spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at Karatepe:
 "In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles" 
In the adjacent region of North Syria, historian Robin Lane Fox remarks funerary stelae showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.Quoted and noted in Fox, Robin Lane (2008). Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer. Vintage Books. p. 77. ISBN 978-0-679-76386-4

[[Laser guide star]]
CATEGORIES: Astronomical imaging, Laser applications

Laser guide stars are an artificial star image created for use in astronomical adaptive optics imaging.
Adaptive optics (AO) systems require a wavefront reference source in order to correct atmospheric distortion of light (called astronomical seeing). Sufficiently bright stars are not available in all parts of the sky, which greatly limits the usefulness of natural guide star adaptive optics. Instead, one can create an artificial guide star by shining a laser into the atmosphere. This star can be positioned anywhere the telescope desires to point, opening up much greater amounts of the sky to adaptive optics. Because the laser beam is deflected by astronomical seeing on the way up, the returning laser light does not move around in the sky as astronomical sources do. In order to keep astronomical images steady, a natural star nearby in the sky must be monitored in order that the motion of the laser guide star can be subtracted using a tip–tilt mirror. However, this star can be much fainter than is required for natural guide star adaptive optics, because it is only used to measure tip and tilt and all higher order distortions are measured with the laser guide star. This means that many more stars are suitable and a correspondingly larger fraction of the sky is accessible.

CATEGORIES: Marilyns of England, Hewitts of England, Fells of the Lake District, Nuttalls, Furness, Highest points of English counties, Coniston

The Old Man of Coniston is a fell in the Furness Fells in the English Lake District. It is [tpl]convert|2634|ft|m|0[/tpl] high, and lies to the west of the village of Coniston and the lake of the same name, Coniston Water. The fell is sometimes known by the alternative name of Coniston Old Man, or simply The Old Man. The mountain is popular with tourists and fell-walkers with a number of well-marked paths to the summit. The mountain has also seen extensive slate mining activity for eight hundred years and the remains of abandoned mines and spoil tips are a significant feature of the north east slopes. There are also several flocks of sheep that are grazed on the mountain.Coniston Local History Group website

[[Bertil Lindblad]]
CATEGORIES: 1895 births, 1965 deaths, Swedish astronomers, Uppsala University alumni, Recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society

Bertil Lindblad (Örebro, 26 November 1895 – Saltsjöbaden, outside Stockholm, 25 June 1965) was a Swedish astronomer.
After finishing his secondary education at Örebro högre allmänna läroverk, Lindblad matriculated at Uppsala University in 1914. He received his filosofie magister degree in 1917, his filosofie licentiat degree in 1918 and completed his doctorate and became a docent at the university in 1920. From 1927 he was professor and astronomer of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and head of the Stockholm Observatory. In the latter capacity he was responsible for the observatory's move from the old building
in the centre of Stockholm to a newly built facility in Saltsjöbaden Observatory, which was opened in 1931.
Lindblad studied the theory of the rotation of galaxies. By making careful observations of the apparent motions of stars, he was able to study the rotation of the Galaxy. He deduced that the rate of rotation of the stars in the outer part of the galaxy, where the Sun is located, decreased with distance from the galactic core. This deduction was soon confirmed by Jan Oort in 1927. A certain
class of resonances in rotating stellar or gaseous disks are named Lindblad resonances, after Bertil Lindblad.
His son, Per-Olof Lindblad, also became an astronomer.

The Good Old Days was a popular BBC television light entertainment programme which ran from 1953 to 1983.
It was performed at the Leeds City Varieties and recreated an authentic atmosphere of the Victorian–Edwardian music hall with songs and sketches of the era performed by present-day performers in the style of the original artistes.
The audience dressed in period costume and joined in the singing, especially "Down at the Old Bull and Bush" which closed the show. The show was compered by Leonard Sachs.  In the course of its run it featured about 2,000 performers.

[[Mills Mess]]
CATEGORIES: Juggling patterns and tricks

In juggling, the Mills Mess is a popular toss juggling pattern, typically performed with three balls although the number and objects can be different. It is considered somewhat of a milestone in juggling, "a mind-boggling pattern of circling balls, crossing and uncrossing hands, and unexpected catches." Gillson, George. Beyond the Cascade, Cascade Books: Seattle Washington 1990. reviewed by Bill Giduz in Juggler's World: Vol. 42, No. 4 
The base of this pattern is a traditional reverse cascade, (siteswap 3 in siteswap notation), with an extra "mess" added by alternately crossing and uncrossing arms. The effect created is that the balls pursue each other from one side to the other.

[[Mount Barker, South Australia]]
CATEGORIES: Towns in South Australia

Mount Barker is an expanding city, home to 14,4522011 Census QuickStats: Mount Barker (Urban Centre) Accessed 16 February 2014. residents, that is 33 kilometres up the South Eastern Freeway, east of Adelaide CBD district, in South Australia. It is the seat of the District Council of Mount Barker, the largest town in the Adelaide Hills, and one of the fastest growing areas in the state.
Mount Barker lies at the base of a local eponymous peak, called the Mount Barker summit. It is 50 kilometres from the Murray River. Mount Barker was traditionally a farming area, and many of the lots just outside the town area are farming lots, although some of them have been replaced with new subdivisions in recent times.
The Mount Barker Summit was first discovered by Captain Collet Barker in 1830, who was killed by Aborigines in 1831. Captain Charles Sturt named Mount Barker after him when he sighted it in 1834.
Mount Barker is well serviced, with a recently upgraded Police station, a Country Fire Service station, the Adelaide Hills State Emergency Service centre, an Ambulance station, and five bus routes.
Mount Barker is in the federal division of Mayo, and the state electoral districts of Kavel and Heysen, with most of the town in Kavel, and only the south-eastern portion of the town in Heysen. Local Federal Member of Parliament, Jamie Briggs, succeeded former Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer.
Mount Barker was the epicentre of an earthquake on 16 April 2010 at 11.35pm local time. The quake registered 3.8 on the Richter scale.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/bin/earthquake.pl?title=Near+Mt+Barker%2C+SA&magnitude=3.8&depth=0&xy=138.840,-35.150&date=16,04,2010&time=13,57,26&bg1=eqrisk_lm&zoom=100&station=STKA |title=Recent Earthquake: Near Mt Barker, SA |author=Geoscience Australia |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl]

Ralph E. Griswold (May 19, 1934, Modesto, CA – October 4, 2006, Tucson, AZ) was a computer scientist known for his research into high-level programming languages and symbolic computation. His language credits include the string processing language  SNOBOL,[tpl]cite book |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Poage |first2=J.F. |last3=Polonsky |first3=Ivan P. |title=The SNOBOL 4 Programming Language |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs NJ |year=1971 |isbn=0-13-815373-6 |edition=2nd [/tpl] SL5,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Hanson |first2=David R. |title=An overview of SL5 |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=40–50 |date=April 1977 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Hanson |first2=David R. |title=The SL5 procedure mechanism |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=392–400 |date=May 1978 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359502[/tpl] and Icon.[tpl]cite book |last1=Griswold |first1=Ralph E. |last2=Griswold |first2=Madge T. |chapter=History of the Icon programming language |editor1-last=Bergin |editor1-first=Thomas J. |editor2-last=Gibson |editor2-first=Richard G. |title=History of Programming Languages II |publisher=ACM Press |location=New York NY |year=1996 [/tpl]
He attended Stanford University, receiving a bachelor's degree in physics, then an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Griswold went to Bell Labs in 1962, where he studied ideas for non-numerical computation. SNOBOL was the outcome; it was a radically different language in its time and still is. He became the head of the Labs' Programming Research and Development department in 1967.
In 1971, he was hired by the University of Arizona to be its first professor of computer science, subsequently organized the department, and was its head until 1981. While at Arizona, Griswold developed Icon.  The earlier Ratfor implementation of Icon was discarded and the language rewritten from scratch in C and UNIX.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shapiro, E. |title=SNOBOL and Icon: Language Designer Ralph Griswold Looks at His Language |journal=Byte |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=341–6 |date=July 1985 [/tpl]
In 1990 Griswold was appointed Regents' Professor, and he retired in 1995. "As one of the founders of the Bell Labs software culture which spawned UNIX, C, and many other essential contributions to modern software, Ralph Griswold brought to his academic research not only brilliance, but also experience and a value system that demanded that research ideas be tested by fire and proven useful and usable by real users, not just good-looking diagrams in academic papers."[tpl]cite web |author=Jeffery, Clinton L. |title=The Icon Language Family |year=2004 |work=CS 580: Compiler Construction Lecture Notes |publisher=New Mexico State University |location=Las Cruces NM |url=http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/courses/580/lecture.html[/tpl]

[[Multi-function display]]
CATEGORIES: Avionics, Aircraft instruments, Glass cockpit

A multi-function display (MFD) (part of multi function structures) is a small screen (CRT or LCD) in an aircraft surrounded by multiple buttons that can be used to display information to the pilot in numerous configurable ways. Often an MFD will be used in concert with a primary flight display. MFDs are part of the digital era of modern planes or helicopter. The first MFD were introduced by air forces. The advantage of an MFD over analog display is that an MFD does not consume much space in the cockpit. For example the cockpit of RAH-66 "Comanche" does not have analog dials or gauges at all. All information is displayed on the MFD pages. The possible MFD pages could differ for every plane, complementing their abilities (in combat).
Many MFDs allow the pilot to display their navigation route, moving map, weather radar, NEXRAD, GPWS, TCAS and airport information all on the same screen.
MFDs were added to the Space Shuttle (as the glass cockpit) starting in 1998 replacing the analog instruments and CRTs. The information being displayed is similar, and the glass cockpit was first flown on the STS-101 mission. 
In modern automotive technology, MFDs are used in cars to display navigation, entertainment and vehicle status information.

Joseph Ludwig Franz Ressel ([tpl]lang-cs|Josef Ludvík František Ressel[/tpl]; 29 June 1793 – 9 October 1857) was an a German Bohemian forester and inventor who designed one of the first working ship's propellers. 
Ressel was born in Chrudim, Bohemia (then part of Habsburg Monarchy). His father Anton Herrmann Ressel was a native German speaker, while his mother Marie Anna Konvičková was a native Czech. He studied in the Linz Gymnasium, České Budějovice artillery school, University of Vienna and the Mariabrunn Forestry Academy at Mariabrunn Monastery near Vienna.
He worked for the Austrian government as a forester in the more southern parts of the monarchy, including in Motovun, Istria (modern-day Croatia). His work was to secure a supply of quality wood for the Navy.Josef Ressel Relevant Non-Istrians, istria.net, accessed 2012-07-30 He worked in Landstrass (Kostanjevica on the Krka river in Carniola in modern-day Slovenia), where he tested his ship propellers for the first time. In 1821 he was transferred to Trieste (modern-day Italy), the biggest port of the Austrian Empire, where his tests were successful. He was awarded a propeller patent in 1827. He modified a steam-powered boat Civetta by 1829 and test-drove it in the Trieste harbor at six knots before the steam conduits exploded. Because of this misfortune, the police banned further testing. The explosion was not caused by the tested propeller as many believed at the time. 
As early as 1804, the American John Fitch is credited with a screw propeller, which was unsuccessful. In 1836, the Englishman Francis Pettit Smith tested a screw propeller similar to Ressel's. The first transatlantic journey of a ship powered by a screw-propeller was by the SS Great Britain in 1845. Propeller design stabilized in the 1880s.
Besides having been called "the inventor of the propeller", he was also called the inventor of the steamship and a monument to him in a park in Vienna
commemorates him as “the one and only inventor of the screw propeller and steam shipping”.
Among other Ressel's inventions are pneumatic post and ball and cylinder bearings. He was granted numerous patents during his life.
He died in Ljubljana (present Slovenia), and was buried there in the St. Christopher Cemetery (now called "Navje Cemetery") in the Bežigrad district.

[[Aegopodium]]
CATEGORIES: Apiaceae

Aegopodium Native to Europe and western Asia. It is a genus of flowering plants of the carrot family Apiaceae, represented by about seven species, all are perennial herbs. Flowers are compounded, umbels appearing in spring-summer. Fruit consists of two-winged or ribbed nuts that separate on ripening.
The most well-known member is the Aegopodium podagraria, the ground elder also known as snow-on-the-mountain, Bishop's weed, goutweed, native to Europe and Asia. It is variegated green and white that sometimes reverts to solid green within a patch. Small, white, five-petal flowers are held about three feet high, above the leaves, in flat topped clusters. Underground are long white branching rhizomes that vaguely resemble quackgrass. Regarded as an ecological threat, goutweed is aggressive, invasive and forms dense patches reducing species diversity in the ground layer. On the other hand, because of this, it is often used as a low maintenance ground cover.
Cultivation Frost hardy but drought tender, preferring moist well-drained soil in an open sunny position. Propagate from seed or rhizome.

It is the headquarters of the East Khasi Hills district and is situated at an average altitude of 4,908 feet (1,496 m) above sea level, with the highest point being Shillong Peak at 6,449 feet (1,966 m). Shillong is the 330th most populous city in India with population of 143,007 according to the 2011 census.http://www.census2011.co.in/city.php It is said that the rolling hills around the town reminded the European settlers of Scotland. Hence, Shillong is known as "Scotland of the East". The population density of the state of Meghalaya in the current decade is 342 people per sq mile.
It has steadily grown in size and significance since it was made the civil station of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills in 1864 by the British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as a Chief Commissioner's Province, it was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration because of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and Surma valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India. Shillong remained the capital of undivided Assam until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya and Assam moved its capital to Dispur in Guwahati.

Stuart Dangerfield (born 17 September 1971, and from Willenhall in the West Midlands) is an English racing cyclist who has been prominent in British individual time trial events during the 1990s and early 21st century.
Dangerfield won his first RTTC national  time trial championship in 1992 in the hill-climb event - a victory he repeated in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1997, he was also [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] time trial champion; he also won the event four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. He won his first national [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|sing=on[/tpl] championship in 2001, with repeat victories in 2003 and 2004. In 2001 he broke [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] competition record with a time of 18'19" (32.76 mph), knocking eight seconds off the previous record, set by Graeme Obree in 1993.
At world championship level, he has represented Great Britain in the individual time trial event at Holland 1998, Brittany 2000, Portugal 2001 and Belgium 2002. He also represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Canada 1994, Malaysia 1998 and Manchester 2002.
Dangerfield was little known outside club cycling circles in Britain, having grown up in the shadow of firstly Chris Boardman and then David Millar. However, Millar's admission to using the illegal drug EPO and consequent expulsion from the Great Britain squad for the 2004 Summer Olympics meant that Dangerfield was called up into the Olympic squad to race the time trial.

CATEGORIES: 1980s British television series, ITV television programmes, Television shows set in Leeds, Television shows set in Yorkshire, Television series by Yorkshire Television, 1985 British television programme debuts, 1985 British television programme endings

The Beiderbecke Affair is a television series produced in the United Kingdom by ITV during 1985, written by the prolific Alan Plater, whose lengthy credits to British Television since the 1960s included the preceding 4 part mini series Get Lost! for ITV in 1981. The Beiderbecke Affair has a similar style to Get Lost!, where Neville Keaton (Alun Armstrong) and Judy Threadgold (Bridget Turner) played in an ensemble cast. Although The Beiderbecke Affair was intended as a sequel to Get Lost!, Alun Armstrong proved to be unavailable and the premise was reworked. It is the first part of The Beiderbecke Trilogy with the two sequel series being The Beiderbecke Tapes (1987) and The Beiderbecke Connection (1988).

The Zachman Framework is an enterprise architecture framework which provides a formal and highly structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise. It consists of a two dimensional classification matrix based on the intersection of six communication questions (What, Where, When, Why, Who and How) with five levels of reification, successively transforming the most abstract ideas (on the Scope level) into more concrete ideas (at the Operations level).[tpl]cite web|url=http://zachman.com/about-the-zachman-framework|title=John Zachman’s Concise Definition of the[tpl]sic|hide=yes[/tpl] The Zachman Framework | publisher=Zachman International|year=2008[/tpl]
The Zachman Framework is a schema for organizing architectural artifacts (in other words, design documents, specifications, and models) that takes into account both whom the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed.A Comparison of the Top Four Enterprise Architecture Methodologies, Roger Sessions, Microsoft Developer Network Architecture Center, The Zachman Framework is not a methodology in that it does not imply any specific method or process for collecting, managing, or using the information that it describes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://zachman.com/about-the-zachman-framework|title=The Zachman Framework: The Official Concise Definition | publisher=Zachman International|year=2008[/tpl]

The Heath Brothers is an American jazz group, formed in 1975 by the brothers Jimmy (tenor saxophone), Percy (bass), and Albert "Tootie" Heath (drums); and pianist Stanley Cowell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tony Purrone (guitar) and Jimmy's son Mtume (percussion) joined the group later. Tootie left in 1978, and was replaced by Akira Tana for a short period before returning in 1982. They also added other sidemen for some of their recording dates.Allmusic
The group still exists with just two of the brothers, Jimmy and Tootie, and additional sidemen as needed. The DVD, Brotherly Jazz: The Heath Brothers, recorded in 2004, shortly before Percy Heath's death, was one of the last times the brothers played together, and chronicled the Heath Brothers' personal lives as well as socio-political issues many jazz musicians dealt with in the later 20th century, including jail, drugs, discrimination and segregation.

[[Arbitrage pricing theory]]
CATEGORIES: Finance theories, Mathematical finance, Portfolio theories, Pricing, Financial economics

In finance, arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is a general theory of asset pricing that holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modeled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors or theoretical market indices, where sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor-specific beta coefficient. The model-derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly -  the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by the model. If the price diverges, arbitrage should bring it back into line. 
The theory was proposed by the economist Stephen Ross in 1976.

[[Carbonic maceration]]
CATEGORIES: Carbon dioxide, Oenology

Carbonic maceration is a winemaking technique, often associated with the French wine region of Beaujolais, in which whole grapes are fermented in a carbon dioxide rich environment prior to crushing. Conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol. Carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape, although grapes at the bottom of the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation. The resulting wine is fruity with very low tannins. It is ready to drink quickly but lacks the structure for long-term aging. In the most extreme case, such as with Beaujolais nouveau, the period between picking and bottling can be less than six weeks.
During carbonic maceration, an anaerobic environment is created by pumping carbon dioxide into a sealed container filled with whole grape clusters. The carbon dioxide gas permeates through the grape skins and begins to stimulate fermentation at an intracellular level. The entire process takes place inside each single, intact berry. Ethanol is produced as a by-product of this process but studies have shown that other unique chemical reactions take place that have a distinctive effect on the wine.

Podestà is the name given to certain high officials in many Italian cities beginning in the later Middle Ages.  Mainly it meant the chief magistrate of a city state, the counterpart to similar positions in other cities that went by other names, e.g. rettori ("rectors"), but it could also mean the local administrator, who was the representative of the Holy Roman Emperor.  Currently, Podestà is the title of mayors in Italian-speaking municipalities of Graubünden in Switzerland.
The term derives from the Latin word potestas, meaning power. Like the development of the Islamic term "Sultan", a term meaning "Power" or "Authority" eventually became the title of the person holding power.There is an uncharacteristically early use of potestas in this sense, in Juvenal, Satire X, 99-101, an image of a magistrate in a little town, judging of weights and measures.

[[Marilyn (hill)]]
CATEGORIES: Marilyns

A Marilyn is a mountain or hill in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland or Isle of Man with a relative height of at least 150 metres (492 ft), regardless of absolute height or other merit. The name was coined as a punning contrast to the designation Munro, used of a Scottish mountain with a height of more than [tpl]convert|3000|ft|m|1[/tpl], which is homophonous with (Marilyn) Monroe.
There are 2,009 Marilyns identified: 1,217 in Scotland, 453 in Ireland (of which 65 are in Northern Ireland), 176 in England, 158 in Wales, 5 on the Isle of Man. Black Mountain, in the Black Mountains, on the border between England and Wales, was formerly counted in both countries but is now treated as being in Wales only.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rhb.org.uk/updates/up200604.htm | last=Dawson | first=Alan | title=Update to The Relative Hills of Britain | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-10-06[/tpl] The list of Marilyns in Britain was compiled by Alan Dawson in his book The Relative Hills of Britain,[tpl]cite book | last=Dawson | first=Alan | year=1992 | title=The Relative Hills of Britain | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ | publisher=Cicerone Press | location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria | isbn=1-85284-068-4[/tpl] and continues to change as resurveying produces revised heights for hills and the cols between them.  The list was extended into Ireland by Clem Clements in a booklet, The Hewitts and Marilyns of Ireland.[tpl]cite book | title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of Ireland | last=Clements | first=E.D. 'Clem' | isbn=0-9522680-8-6 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1998[/tpl]
Although many of the islands' largest hills including Ben Nevis, Carrantuohill, Scafell Pike and Snowdon are Marilyns, many other large hills such as Cairngorm, a number of Munros, and other well-known hills such as Bowfell, the Langdale Pikes and Carnedd Dafydd, are not Marilyns because they do not have sufficient relative height. However, some lower hills such as Seatallan and Watch Hill on the edges of Lakeland and the Long Mynd in Shropshire do qualify because of their isolation from higher hills.  Not all of the Marilyns are even hills in the usual sense: one, the highest point of the Weald, lies within the East Sussex town of Crowborough, whilst the top of the Yorkshire Wolds, Bishop Wilton Wold, lies alongside the A166 road.  At the other extreme are Stac Lee and Stac an Armin, the two highest sea stacks in the British Isles, in the St Kilda archipelago, over 81 miles (130 km) west of the Scottish mainland.

William Allen Miller FRS (17 December 1817 – 30 September 1870) was a British scientist.
He was born in Ipswich, Suffolk and educated at Ackworth School and King's College London.
On the death of John Frederic Daniell he succeeded to the Chair of Chemistry at King's. Although primarily a chemist, the scientific contributions for which Miller is mainly remembered today are in spectroscopy and astrochemistry, new fields in his time.
Miller won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1867 jointly with William Huggins, for their spectroscopic study of the composition of stars. In 1845, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=7&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27miller%27%29 |title= Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 30 January 2011[/tpl]

[[Recording format]]
CATEGORIES: Communication, Information science, Data management, Film and video technology, Computer storage media, Recording

A recording format  is a format for encoding data for storage on a storage medium. The format can be container information such as sectors on a disk, or user/audience information (content) such as analog stereo audio.  Multiple levels of encoding may be achieved in one format. For example, a text encoded page may contain HTML and XML encoding, combined in a plain text file format, using either EBCDIC or ASCII character encoding, on a UDF digitally formatted disk.  
In electronic media, the primary format is the encoding that requires hardware to interpret (decode) data; while secondary encoding is interpreted by secondary signal processing methods, usually computer software.

Norvega Esperantista Ligo (Norsk Esperanto-Forbund, Norwegian Esperanto League) was founded in 1911. As the Norwegian arm of the Esperanto movement, its aim is to spread knowledge and use of the international language Esperanto. The league has a modest size of a couple of hundred members, and work done within NEL is mostly voluntary. The youth wing of NEL is Norvega Junularo Esperantista.
Affiliated with the largest international Esperanto organization, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio (UEA), the association has a permanent office in Oslo (also used by the Esperanto club of Oslo) and local subgroups scattered around the country. The Grupo Esperantista de Trondheim (Norwegian: Trondheim Esperantoklubb), for example, celebrated its centennial on June 16, 2007.

CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman forts in England, Archaeological sites in Kent, City of Canterbury, Country parks in Kent, Monasteries in Kent, Villages in Kent

Reculver is a village and coastal resort about [tpl]convert|3|mi|km|0[/tpl] east of Herne Bay in south-east England, in a ward of the same name, in the City of Canterbury district of Kent. It is about [tpl]convert|30|mi|km|0[/tpl] east by north of the county town of Maidstone, and about [tpl]convert|58|mi|km|0[/tpl] east by south from London. Reculver once occupied a strategic location at the north-western end of the Wantsum Channel, a sea lane which separated the Isle of Thanet and the Kent mainland until the late Middle Ages. This led the Romans to build a small fort there at the time of their conquest of Britain in 43 AD, and, starting late in the 2nd century, they built a larger fort, or castrum, called Regulbium, which later was part of the chain of Saxon Shore forts. The military connection resumed in the Second World War, when Barnes Wallis's bouncing bombs were tested in the sea off Reculver.
After the Romans left Britain early in the 5th century, Reculver became a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the establishment of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669 AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The twin spires of the church became a landmark for mariners known as the Twin Sisters, and the 19th-century facade of St John's Cathedral in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, is a copy of that at Reculver.
Reculver declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.
The 20th century saw a revival as a tourism industry developed and there are now three caravan parks. The census of 2001 recorded 135 people in the Reculver area, nearly a quarter of whom were in caravans at the time. Reculver Country Park is a Special Protection Area, Site of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar site, which has rare clifftop meadows and is important for migrating birds.

[[Cancer vaccine]]

CATEGORIES: Vaccination, Cancer vaccines

A cancer vaccine is a vaccine that treats existing cancer or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as therapeutic cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.
Some types of cancer, such as cervical cancer and some liver cancers, are caused by viruses (known as oncoviruses), and traditional vaccines against those viruses, such as HPV vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, will prevent those types of cancer. These anti-viral vaccines are not further discussed in the rest of this article. Other cancers are to some extent caused by bacterial infections (e.g. stomach cancer and Helicobacter pylorihttp://vaccinenewsdaily.com/news/213394-oral-vaccine-could-fight-source-of-stomach-cancers) and traditional vaccines against cancer-causing bacteria are also not discussed in this article.
Scientists have also been trying to develop vaccines against existing cancers. Some researchers believe that cancer cells routinely arise and are destroyed by the healthy immune system;[tpl]cite journal |journal= Nature |date=2001-04-26 |volume=410 |pages=1107–1111 |title= IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity. |author= Shankaran V, Ikeda H, Bruce AT, White JM, Swanson PE, Old LJ, Schreiber RD. |pmid=11323675 |issue= 6832 |doi= 10.1038/35074122[/tpl] cancer forms when the immune system fails to destroy them.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dunn GP, Old LJ, Schreiber RD |title=The three Es of cancer immunoediting |journal=Annu.

"The Anacreontic Song", also known by its incipit "To Anacreon In Heaven", was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Attributed to the composer John Stafford Smith, the tune was later used by several writers as a setting for their patriotic lyrics. These included two songs by Francis Scott Key, most famously his poem "Defence of Fort M'Henry". The latter combination became known as "The Star-Spangled Banner" and was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America, in 1931.

CATEGORIES: Moving companies, Moving and relocation

Relocation services or employee relocation include a range of internal business processes to transfer employees, their families, and/or entire departments of a business to a new location. Like other types of employee benefits, these processes are usually administered by human resources specialists within a corporation and outsourced to different types of service providers. Relocation services are not synonymous with moving/relocation companies as not all of these companies offer "relocation ''services'".
Such business processes can include domestic residential services where an employee moves within a country or state as well as international relocation services which include planning for diplomats, managers etc. working abroad. An agency providing relocation services directs and manages the process of relocation including arranging necessary documents (visa, long-term stay permissions), finding a new house (accommodation), finding a school for children (education), finding a job for the partner or "trailing spouse", arranging a teacher for the family (language teaching) and introducing fresh expats to the local culture.

[[Saturday Night Fry]]
CATEGORIES: BBC Radio comedy programmes, 1988 radio programme debuts

Saturday Night Fry was a six-part comedy series on BBC Radio 4, first broadcast between 30 April and 4 June 1988. Episode One had previously been broadcast as a pilot on 19 December 1987, under the title 'Fry on Saturday'.
Hosted by Stephen Fry — accompanied each week by a selection of guests including Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Phyllida Law, Robert Bathurst, Julia Hills, Alison Steadman and long-time collaborator Hugh Laurie — the show took the form of a round table discussion and sketches which veered tangentially from the sublime to the ridiculous. Parodies of television and radio formats were common ('Fat Man On A Bicycle', and so on). Controversial satirist Chris Morris has praised the show on many occasions, in particular for its observations on the media. Many[tpl]who|date=September 2013[/tpl] say its influence can be felt in On The Hour and other such programmes. 
Snippets of classical music were used to mark breaks between items, usually succeeded by Fry's voice saying, "And as the strains of the  fade away we turn to..." On one occasion, in line with a running joke throughout the episode, the last of these in the show was said as " And as the strains of Julia being slapped fades away..."
This is most likely a reference to the long running BBC show Just A Minute, which begins each show with "And as the Minute Waltz fades away..."
Although slightly different in format the series could be seen as a direct precursor to A Bit of Fry and Laurie, the 1989 television series (piloted in 1987), which employed a very similar style of humour and wordplay (indeed, it invented the language Strom, which gave birth to the farewell phrase "Soupy twist", and also gave rise to the phrase "Mr. Music, will you play?"). Certain editions were constructed in complex knots: one edition saw the cast rearranging the script as a practical joke whilst Fry has gone to the toilet, ending up in him reading the part where they do that and so finding them red-handed, whilst the first edition fell in and out of dream sequences caused by a devilish potion. 
The signature tune opening each episode was "Saturday Night Fish Fry" by Louis Jordan. This would always be preceded by a rather convoluted introduction from Fry.
In 2009, the series was released on a triple compact disc set by BBC Audio in June and reaired the following month on BBC Radio 7.[tpl]citenews|title=Comedy preview: Saturday Night Fry, audio|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/may/30/stephen-fry-comedy|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]citenews|title=BBC Radio 7 Programmes - Saturday Night Fry|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l2swy|publisher=BBC Radio 7[/tpl]
There was also a show of the same name running on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, again hosted by Fry. This was a completely different show, however, being a series of 45-minute serious debates interspersed with the occasional sketch or piece of music.

[[BACnet]]
CATEGORIES: Communication, Network protocols, Building automation

BACnet is a communications protocol for building automation and control networks. It is an ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO standard[ref]
</ref> protocol.
BACnet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control, lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform. Proper communication between building automation devices is critical for maximizing building energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and other aspects of "green" buildings.[tpl]cite web|last=Rajecki|first=Ron|title=BACnet Technology Key to ‘World’s Greenest Office Building’|url=http://hpac.com/building-controls/bacnet-technology-key-world-s-greenest-office-building?NL=HPAC-04&Issue=HPAC-04_20130905_HPAC-04_741&YM_RID=bdorsey@kmccontrols.com&YM_MID=1420553&sfvc4enews=42|publisher=HPAC Engineering|accessdate=11 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=BACnet: The Backbone of Intelligent Buildings|url=http://www.facilitiesnet.com/buildingautomation/article/BACnet-Helps-Make-Buildings-Intelligent-Meet-Control-and-Data-Analysis-Goals--14237?source=part|publisher=Building Operating Management|accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]

Dr. Jerri Lin Nielsen (née Cahill; March 1, 1952 – June 23, 2009) was an American physician with extensive ER experience,Nielsen 01: 1-4 who in 1998 was hired to spend a year at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, as the station's only doctor.Nielsen 01: 24
During the southern winter, at a time when the station is physically cut off from the rest of the world, she developed breast cancer. Nielsen teleconferenced with medical personnel in the United States, and had to operate on herself in order to extract tissue samples for analysis. A military plane was later dispatched to the pole to airdrop equipment and medications. Her condition remained life-threatening, and the first plane to land at the station in the spring was sent several weeks earlier than planned, despite adverse weather conditions, to bring her to the U.S. as soon as possible. Her ordeal attracted a great amount of attention from the media, and Nielsen later wrote an autobiographical book recounting her story."Doctor in South Pole Rescue Dies at 57" "New York Times", 24 June 2009. http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/06/24/us/AP-US-Obit-Jerri-Nielsen.html
Despite the extraordinary efforts of Nielsen and supporting crew and rescue team, her cancer was not cured by the available treatments. It recurred seven years later, eventually causing her death in 2009 from brain metastatic disease, eleven years after initial diagnosis.

Ercole (Hercules) Dembowski (January 12, 1812 – January 19, 1881) was an Italian astronomer.
He was born in Milan. He inherited the title of "Baron" as the son of Jan Dembowski (Dębowski), one of Napoleon's Polish generals.  He served in the navy of Austria-Hungary until 1843 when he retired for health reasons to Naples.[tpl]cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Publishing |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58354.html[/tpl]
He was a tireless observer of double stars and made tens of thousands of micrometer measurements.  In particular, he remeasured many double stars from Friedrich Struve's Dorpat Catalogue, noting how some of them had changed position over the years due to their mutual orbit as binary stars.
He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1878.
The crater Dembowski on the Moon is named after him, as well as the minor planet 349_Dembowska.

The North Loop is a neighborhood of the Central community of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The neighborhood is commonly known as the Warehouse District from the city's shipping hub years.  It includes the Minneapolis Warehouse Historic District which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The North Loop is located just northwest of the central business district between downtown Minneapolis and the Mississippi River. Streets in the North Loop are oriented to be parallel to the river, which means that they run at a 45-degree angle.
Although the extent of the neighborhood technically extends further to the south, the main residential and commercial area of the North Loop is roughly a rectangle bounded by Hennepin Avenue (in the southeast), Plymouth Avenue (in the northwest), the elevated 4th street freeway entrance/exit in the southwest, and the Mississippi River in the northeast.  Washington Avenue is the main thoroughfare through the neighborhood.
The James I. Rice Park, which is in the northeast portion of the neighborhood along the river, is popular with residents during the summer months. The bike trail and West River Parkway that runs through the park are part of the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway.  The park added a playground in 2010 located where 4th Ave North intersects with West River Parkway.[tpl]cite web|title=MN Public Radio|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/10/27/playground/|accessdate=2011-04-06[/tpl]

[[List of people with bipolar disorder]]
CATEGORIES: People with bipolar disorder, Lists of people with disabilities, Lists of people by proposed medical condition

This is a list of people, living or dead, accompanied by verifiable source citations associating them with bipolar disorder (formerly known as "manic depression"), either based on their own public statements, or (in the case of dead people only) reported contemporary or posthumous diagnoses of bipolar disorder.
Regarding posthumous diagnoses: many famous people are believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder. Most of these listed have been diagnosed based on evidence in their own writings and contemporaneous accounts by those who knew them.  It is often suggested that genius (or, at least, creative talent) and mental disorder (specifically, the mania and hypomania of bipolar disorder) are linked; the connection was widely publicized by Kay Redfield Jamison in Touched with Fire, although many of the diagnoses in the book are made by Jamison herself.  Also, persons prior to the 20th century may have incomplete or speculative diagnoses of bipolar disorder (e.g. Vincent van Gogh.)

Goose bumps, also called goose flesh, goose pimples, the medical term cutis anserina, are the bumps on a person's skin at the base of body hairs which may involuntarily develop when a person is cold or experiences strong emotions such as fear, nostalgia, pleasure, euphoria, awe, admiration and sexual arousal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/music/questions/goosebumps.html |title=Science of Music: Why Does Music Give Me Goose Bumps? | Exploratorium |publisher=Exploratorium.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14[/tpl] 
The formation of goose bumps in humans under stress is a vestigial reflex;Darwin, Charles. (1872) The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals John Murray, London. its function in human ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators. The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as arasing, piloerection, or the pilomotor reflex. It occurs in many mammals besides humans; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators.

He earned his B.Sc in physics at the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1942. He then worked as a research associate under Hideki Yukawa at Kyoto University. He made additions to the big bang nucleosynthesis model that built upon the work of the classic Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper.
Probably his most famous work was the astrophysical calculations that led to the Hayashi tracks of star formation, and the Hayashi limit that puts a limit on star radius.
He was also involved in the early study of Brown dwarfs, some of the smallest stars formed.
He retired in 1984.
He won the Eddington Medal in 1970, the Kyoto Prize in 1995, and the Bruce Medal in 2004.

The traditional claims made—and recognised as such in the introduction—about a new British poetry generation taking over the "mainstream", were greeted in this case by more than the usual controversy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Poets in the 1962 Al Alvarez anthology, The New Poetry, were excluded.[tpl]Verify source|date=November 2008[/tpl]  The inclusion of Irish poet Seamus Heaney led to him to deliver a riposte in his poem, An Open Letter (1983):

[[Feeder line (network)]]

CATEGORIES: Power engineering, Public transport, Network topology

A feeder line is a peripheral route or branch in a network, which connects smaller or more remote nodes with a route or branch carrying heavier traffic. The term is applicable to any system based on a hierarchical network
In telecommunications, a feeder line branches from a main line or trunk line.
In electrical engineering, a feeder line is a type of transmission line. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an antenna, usually open wire (air-insulated wire line) or twin-lead from a shortwave transmitter. In power engineering, a feeder line is part of an electric distribution network, usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.
The concept of feeder lines is also important in public transportation. The term is particularly used in US air travel and rail transport. Efficient, high-capacity routes connect important nodes while feeder lines connect these nodes to departure and destination points.

Robert Knox, [tpl]Post-nominals|post-noms=FRSE FRCSE MWS[/tpl] (4 September 1791 – 20 December 1862) was a Scottish surgeon, anatomist and zoologist. He was the most popular lecturer in anatomy in Edinburgh before his involvement in the Burke and Hare murders. This ruined his career, and a later move to London did not improve matters. His later pessimistic view of humanity contrasted sharply with his youthful attachment to the ideas of Étienne Geoffroy.
Knox's ideas on anthropology and ethnology are now considered racist, notably his view, shared widely by his contemporaries, that Anglo-Saxons are an innately superior people. This also harmed his legacy, although he always rejected natural theology and believed that there was a blood relationship between all living things.Desmond, Adrian J. 1989.

Arab Christians (Arabic: العرب المسيحيين Al-'Arab Al-Masihiyin) are ethnic Arabs of Christian faith,http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm "First, they are not recognized as distinct ethnic identities, but rather as segments from the wide "Arab nation" who are "of Christian faith." 
They are the remnants of ancient Arab Christian clans or Arabized Christians (Melchites). Many of the modern Arab Christians are descendants of pre-Islamic Christian Arabian tribes, namely the Kahlani Qahtani tribes of ancient Yemen (i.e. Ghassanids, Lakhmids and Banu Judham). During the 5th and 6th centuries the Ghassanids, who adopted Monophysite Christianity, formed one of the most powerful Arab confederations allied to Christian Byzantium, being a buffer against the pagan tribes of Arabia. The last king of the Lakhmids, Nu'man III, a client of the Sasanian (Persian) Empire in the late sixth century AD, also converted to Christianity (in this case, to the Nestorian sect).Philip K. Hitti.

Arab Christians, forming Greek Orthodox (including Arab Orthodox) and Latin Christian communities, are estimated to be 200,000 in Syria, a 100,000 in Jordan and an equal number or more among the Palestinian Arab population and within the Arab-Israeli population combined.name=walid>http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm[/ref] There is also a sizeable Arab Christian Orthodox community in Lebanon and marginal communities in Iraq and Egypt. Arab Christians term is also generally applied to Arabized Melkite societies in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, who trace their roots to Greek and Aramaic-speaking Byzantine Christians.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] Some Arab Christians are a more recent end result of Evangelization.Emigrants from Arab Christian (including Melkites) communities make up a significant proportion of the Middle Eastern diaspora, with sizeable population concentrations across the Americas, most notably in Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the US. 
Arab Christians are not the only Christian group in the Middle East, with significant non-Arab indigenous Christian communities of ethnic Assyrians, Armenians, Georgians, Greeks and others. Besides those, large ethno-religious Middle Eastern Christian groups such as Copts and Maronites are being argued with a great deal of controversy whether their ethnic identity is Arab or not. Even though sometimes classified as Arab Christians, the largest Middle Eastern Christian groups of Lebanese Maronites and Egyptian Copts often claim non-Arab ethnicity: significant proportion of the Maronites claim descent from ancient Phoenicians, while some Egyptian Copts also eschew an Arab identity, preferring an Ancient Egyptian one. However, both Maronites and Copts had lost their linguistic differentiation during the Ottoman period in favor of the Arabic language, given the cultural, economic and political prestige which Arabic enjoyed. The Syriac Christian groups, composed largely of Chaldo-Assyrians, form the majority of Christians in Iraq, north east Syria, south-east Turkey and north-west Iran. They are generally defined as non-Arab ethnic groups, including by the governments of Iraq, Iran and Turkey. Assyrians practice their own native dialects of Syriac-Aramaic language, in addition to also speaking local Arabic dialects. Despite their ancient pre-Arabic roots and distinct linguo-cultural identities,http://www.cambriapress.com/abi/9781604975833abi.pdf Assyro-Chaldeans are sometimes incorrectly related by Western sources as "Christians of the Arab World" or "Arabic Christians", creating confusion about their identity.http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf "In spite of the widespread geographical imaginations of the Middle East as an Arabic and Islamic monolith, supported by Western mass media and some Middle Eastern states high politicians, the Middle East is quite a heterogeneous region. This region comprises numerous ethnic national, religious, linguistic or ethno-religious groups." Assyrians were also related as "Arab Christians" by pan-Arab movements and Arab-Islamic regimes against their will.http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm "Arab-Islamic regimes in the region assert that all those Christians who live within the confines of 'Arab borders' are 'Arab'."http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf "Assyrians are an ethnically, linguistically and religiously distinct minority in the Middle Eastern region."

The user did have a solver (another HP first) available, but only had about 1.5 K of continuous memory available to store equations. 
The calculator had many functions buried in a menu structure. The clamshell design was fairly robust, but the battery door is the Achilles' heel of this whole line; 18C, 19B, and 28C/S.
The HP-18C was introduced in 1986.

Bowman Foster Ashe (April 3, 1885 – December 16, 1952) was a U.S. educator who served as the first president of the University of Miami.
Ashe attended Mount Union College and then transferred to the University of Pittsburgh where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree In 1910. After graduation, he took a job teaching English and history in public school. Ashe also worked as the educational/social director of Langeloth, a model town near Pittsburgh. Ashe’s work eventually led him back to the University of Pittsburgh where he became a faculty member and supervised the admission, transfer and academic progress of freshmen and sophomores.
The founders of UM hired Ashe from Pittsburgh to oversee the institution during its challenged infancy. During Ashe's presidency, the University added the School of Law (1928), the School of Business Administration (1929), the School of Education (1929), the Graduate School (1941), the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (1943), the School of Engineering (1947), and the School of Medicine (1952).
In 1929, with the collapse of the economy, UM's financial plight was severe, and Ashe took over as Chairman of its Board of Trustees.  He later gave up that role but continued as President.  He recruited Jay F. W. Pearson from the University of Pittsburgh to join him as a part of the charter faculty and as an administrator. Pearson took over as president in November 1952 upon the first of two debilitating strokes which led to Ashe's death the following month.[tpl]cite news | title=President Ashe Dies at 67 | url=http://merrick.library.miami.edu/u?/hurricane,8568 | newspaper=The Miami Hurricane | location=Coral Gables, Florida | date=Dec 17, 1952 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Miami Mourning Death of Ashe | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9-IrAAAAIBAJ&pg=1108%2C6683891 | newspaper=Kentucky New Era | location=Hopkinsville, Kentucky | date=Dec 17, 1952 | agency=Associated Press [/tpl] Ashe was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the University of Miami's highest honor.

[[1961–62 United States network television schedule]]

The 1961–62 United States network television schedule was for the period that began in September 1961 and ran through April 1962. 
The previous season had been excoriated by Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow in May 1961. Minow had criticized poor programs and weak network schedules, calling television a "vast wasteland" and calling on television executives to try harder to develop innovative and interesting television programs.[tpl]cite book| last = Castleman| first = Harry| authorlink = |author2= Walter J.

Television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982) believe the 1961–62 season marked a comeback for television, as the networks rearranged their schedules to accommodate the critics. They point out CBS's high-quality legal drama The Defenders, NBC's medical drama Dr. Kildare, CBS's The Dick Van Dyke Show, and ABC's medical drama Ben Casey as bright spots in the new TV schedule. Despite the praise for these four series, the authors also highlight several less worthy series which debuted during the 1961–62 season: Room for One More, Window on Main Street, Hazel ("possibly the dumbest family in TV history"), and the truly terrible The Hathaways ("possibly the worst series ever to air on network TV").
NBC lured Disney's popular anthology series from ABC; Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color premiered on September 24, 1961. The color programs were a change from the previous ABC programs, which had been seen in black and white.
NBC also added a movie night to its schedule; the network paid $25 million for the rights to broadcast 50 20th-Century Fox films on Saturday nights. In April 1962, ABC followed suit when it added its own Sunday night movie to its schedule.
All times are Eastern and Pacific. New fall series are highlighted in bold.

[[Horizontal branch]]

CATEGORIES: Horizontal-branch stars, Hertzsprung–Russell classifications

The horizontal branch (HB) is a stage of stellar evolution that immediately follows the red giant branch in stars whose masses are similar to the Sun's. The helium core flash that occurs to stars at the top of the red giant branch causes substantial changes in stellar structure, resulting in an overall reduction in luminosity, some contraction of the stellar envelope, and surfaces reaching higher temperatures. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion in a shell surrounding the core.
Horizontal branches were discovered with the first deep photographic photometric studies of globular clusters

and were notable for being absent from all open clusters that had been studied up to that time. The horizontal branch is so named because in low-metallicity samples like globular clusters, HB stars lie along a roughly horizontal line in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (CMD).

[[Gargunnock]]

CATEGORIES: Villages in Stirling (council area)

Gargunnock is a small village in the Stirling council area approximately seven miles west of Stirling,AA Route Planner in Scotland. The 2001 census population was 944. It is situated on the south edge of the Carse of Stirling, at the feet of the Gargunnock Hills, part of the Campsie Fells. 
Several small burns flow down from the Gargunnock Hills 
The last naturally suitable crossing point on the Forth before reaching Stirling Bridge is situated just outside of Gargunnock. This, coupled with the land condition and drainage around the feet or the Gargunnock hills, made Gargunnock the ideal location to build a farming settlement.
During the occupation of Scotland, the English posted a garrison in the Peel tower on the outskirts of the village to protect this important ferry. It is believed that William Wallace brought his army through Gargowans, setting up fort on the Kier Hill, to take control of this part of the river in advance of the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Bonny Prince Charlie is also said to have passed through the village on his travels.
More recently, during the nineteenth century Gargunnock was famous for its fine oak-spale baskets, until intensive deforestation removed the raw materials necessary for this trade and the industry moved to Loch Lomond. 
Nowadays, the village has a very lively community with a busy school, Gargunnock Primary.
The majority of pupils from Gargunnock Primary continue their secondary education at the nearby Stirling High School, with others attending Balfron High School.

The Canadian federal election of 1949 was held on June 27 to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 21st Parliament of Canada.  It was the first election in Canada in almost thirty years in which the Liberal Party of Canada was not led by William Lyon Mackenzie King. King had retired in 1948, and was replaced as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by Louis St. Laurent.  It was also the first federal election with Newfoundland voting, having joined Canada in March of that year. The Liberal Party was re-elected with its fourth consecutive majority government, winning just under 50% of the vote. This victory was the third largest majority government in Canadian History.
The Progressive Conservative Party, led by former Premier of Ontario George Drew, gained little ground in this election.
Smaller parties, such as the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Social Credit, a party that advocated monetary reform, lost support to the Liberals, and to a lesser extent, the Conservatives.

[[Valpromide]]
CATEGORIES: Anticonvulsants, Amides

Valpromide (marketed as Depamide by Sanofi-Aventis) is a carboxamide derivative of valproic acid used in the treatment of epilepsy and some affective disorders. It is rapidly metabolised (80%) to valproic acid (another anticonvulsant) but has anticonvulsant properties itself. It may produce more stable plasma levels than valproic acid or sodium valproate and may be more effective at preventing febrile seizures. However, it is over one hundred times more potent as an inhibitor of liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase. This makes it incompatible with carbamazepine and can affect the ability of the body to remove other toxins. Valpromide is no safer during pregnancy than valproic acid.
Valpromide is formed through the reaction of valproic acid and ammonia via an intermediate acid chloride.
In pure form, valpromide is a white crystalline powder and has melting point 125–126 °C. It is practically insoluble in water but soluble in hot water. It is available on the market in some European countries.

[[Intensional definition]]

CATEGORIES: Necessity, Definition

In logic and mathematics, an intensional definition gives the meaning of a term by specifying all the properties required to come to that definition, that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the set being defined. 
For example, an intensional definition of bachelor is 'unmarried man'. Being an unmarried man is an essential property of something referred to as a bachelor. It is a necessary condition: one cannot be a bachelor without being an unmarried man. It is also a sufficient condition: any unmarried man is a bachelor.Cook, Roy T. "Intensional Definition." In A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009. 155.
This is the opposite approach to the extensional definition, which defines by listing everything that falls under that definition — an extensional definition of bachelor would be a listing of all the unmarried men in the world.
As becomes clear, intensional definitions are best used when something has a clearly defined set of properties, and it works well for sets that are too large to list in an extensional definition. It is impossible to give an extensional definition for an infinite set, but an intensional one can often be stated concisely — there is an infinite number of even numbers, impossible to list, but they can be defined by saying that even numbers are integer multiples of two. 
Definition by genus and difference, in which something is defined by first stating the broad category it belongs to and then distinguished by specific properties, is a type of intensional definition. As the name might suggest, this is the type of definition used in Linnaean taxonomy to categorize living things, but is by no means restricted to biology. Suppose we define a miniskirt as "a skirt with a hemline above the knee." We've assigned it to a genus, or larger class of items: it is a type of skirt. Then, we've described the differentia, the specific properties that make it its own sub-type: it has a hemline above the knee.
Intensional definition also applies to rules or sets of axioms that generate all members of the set being defined. For example, an intensional definition of "square number" can be "any number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself." The rule—"take an integer and multiply it by itself"—always generates members of the set of square numbers, no matter which integer one chooses, and for any square number, there is an integer that was multiplied by itself to get it. 
Similarly, an intensional definition of a game, such as chess, would be the rules of the game; any game played by those rules must be a game of chess, and any game properly called a game of chess must have been played by those rules.

According to the narrative in  Luke, Simeon was a devout Jew who had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour.  When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of consecration of the firstborn son (not the circumcision, but rather after the time of Mary's purification: at least 40 days after the birth), Simeon was there, and he took Jesus into his arms and uttered words rendered variously as follows.

[[Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange]]

CATEGORIES: Tamil Character Encoding Standards, Character sets

Tamil Script Code for Information Interchange (TSCII) is a coding scheme for representing the Tamil script.  The lower 128 codepoints are plain ASCII, the upper 128 codepoints are TSCII-specific. After long years of being used on the Internet by private agreement only, it was successfully registered with the IANA in 2007.http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-reg/TSCII
TSCII encodes the characters in visual (written) order, paralleling the use of the Tamil Typewriter.
Unicode has used the logical order encoding strategy for Tamil, following ISCII, in contrast to the case of Thai, where the visual order encoding grandfathered by TIS-620 was adopted.
The government of Tamil Nadu endorses its own TAB/TAM standards for 8-bit encoding and other, older encoding schemes can still be found on the WWW.
The free etext collection at Project Madurai uses the TSCII encoding, but has already started to provide Unicode versions.

[[Bakırçay]]
CATEGORIES: Rivers of Turkey

Bakırçay (Latin name: Caicus, also Caecus; [tpl]Lang-el|Καϊκός[/tpl], transliterated as Kaïkos; formerly Astraeus) is the current name of a river of Asia Minor that rises in the Temnus mountains and flows through Lydia, Mysia, and Aeolis before it debouches into the Elaitic Gulf.Herodotus. The Histories. vi. 28; vii. 42.Hazlitt. Classical Gazetteer To the Hittites, it may have been the Seha river, however the modern Gediz river further south is a more likely candidate. The modern Turkish name of the river is Bakırçay (formerly the Aksu), and it is located in the Asian part of Turkey.
The river is first mentioned by Hesiod,Hesiod. Theogony 343 who, along with the other poets, fixes the quantity of the penultimate syllable of Caicus. Plutarch relates that the name of the river was originally Astraeus but was changed after Caicus, a son of Hermes, threw himself into it after sleeping with his sister Alcippe.William Smith. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology
Strabo (p. 616) says that the sources of the Caicus are in a plain separated by the range of Temnus from the plain of Apiae, and that the plain of Apia lies above the plain of Thebe in the interior. He adds that there also flows from Tetanus a river (the Mysius) which joins the Caicus below its source. The Caicus enters the sea approximately 12 km from Pitane, and 3 km from Elaea. Elaea was the port of Pergamon, which was on the Caicus, approximately 25 km from Elaea.Strabo p. 615. At the source of the Caicus, according to Strabo, was a place called Gergitha. 
The course of this river has undoubtedly changed since antiquity; nor is it easy to assign the proper ancient names to the branches in the ordinary maps. Leake infers from the direction of L. Scipio's marchLivy. xxxvii. 37 from Troy to the Hyrcanian plain, that the north-eastern branch of the river of Pergamon (Bergama or Beryma) which flows by Menduria (possibly Gergitha) and Balıkesir (Caesaraea) is that which was anciently called Caicus; and he makes the Mysius join it on the right bank.William Martin Leake. Asia Minor, p. 269. The Caicus as it seems is formed by two streams which meet between 50 and 65 km above its mouth, and it drains an extensive and fertile country.

CATEGORIES: 1962 elections in Canada, Canadian federal elections by year

The Canadian federal election of 1962 was held on June 18, 1962 to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 25th Parliament of Canada. When the election was called, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada of Prime Minister John George Diefenbaker had governed for four years with the then-largest majority in the House of Commons in Canadian history.  
This election reduced the Tories to a tenuous minority government as a result of economic difficulties such as high unemployment and a slumping Canadian dollar, as well as unpopular decisions such as the cancellation of the Avro Arrow.  Despite the Diefenbaker government's difficulties, the Liberal Party, led by Lester Pearson, was unable to make up enough ground in the election to defeat the government.  For Social Credit, routed from the Commons just four years earlier, this election proved to be their most successful ever - they would never better the 30 seats won, losing seats in 1963 despite gaining a slightly better share of the vote.

The John F. Kennedy Expressway is a [tpl]convert|17.8|mi|km|2|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] freeway that travels northwest from the Chicago Loop to O'Hare International Airport. The highway is named for the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, and conforms to the Chicago-area convention of using the term Expressway for an Interstate Highway without tolls. The Interstate 90 (I-90) portion of the Kennedy is a part of the much longer I-90 (which runs [tpl]convert|3111.52|mi|km|2[/tpl] from Boston, Massachusetts to Seattle, Washington). The Kennedy's official endpoints are the Circle Interchange with Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway/Congress Parkway) and the Dan Ryan Expressway (also I-90/94) at the east end, and the O'Hare Airport terminals at the west end. The Interstate 190 portion of the Kennedy is [tpl]convert|3.07|mi|km|2[/tpl] long and is meant to serve airport traffic. Interstate 90 picks up the Kennedy destination and runs a further [tpl]convert|6.29|mi|km|2[/tpl], before joining with I-94 for the final [tpl]convert|8.44|mi|km|2[/tpl].
Traveling eastbound from O'Hare, the Kennedy interchanges with the eastern terminus of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (Interstate 90) and with the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 294) at a complex junction just west of Illinois Route 171 (Cumberland Avenue). The Kennedy later merges with the southern end of the Edens Expressway (Interstate 94) at Montrose Avenue; the Kennedy (at this point both I-90 and I-94) then turns south to its junction with the Dan Ryan and Eisenhower Expressways and Congress Parkway at the Circle Interchange in downtown Chicago.
With up to 327,000 vehicles traveling on some portions of the Kennedy daily, the Kennedy and its South Side extension, the Dan Ryan, are the busiest roads in Illinois.[tpl]cite web |author=Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url=http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title=T2 GIS Data  |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |year= 2006[/tpl]

It differs from Citrus in having deciduous, compound leaves, and pubescent (downy) fruit. 
It is native to northern China and Korea, and is also known as the Chinese Bitter Orange.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arhomeandgarden.org/plantoftheweek/articles/hardy_orange_2-9-07.htm |title=Hardy Orange or Trifoliate Orange - Plant of the Week |publisher=Arhomeandgarden.org |date=2007-02-09 |accessdate=2011-01-19[/tpl]
The plant is fairly hardy (USDA zone 5) and will tolerate moderate frost and snow, making a large shrub or small tree 4–8 m tall. Because of the relative hardiness of Poncirus, citrus grafted onto it are usually hardier than when grown on their own roots.

The Siege of Belgrade or Battle of Belgrade or Siege of Nándorfehérvár occurred from July 4 to July 22, 1456. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II was rallying his resources in order to subjugate the Kingdom of Hungary. His immediate objective was the border fort of the town of Belgrade (in old Hungarian Nándorfehérvár). John Hunyadi, a Hungarian nobleman and warlord who had fought many battles against the Ottomans in the previous two decades, prepared the defenses of the fortress.
The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Ottoman camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmed II to lift the siege and retreat. The battle had significant consequences, as it stabilized the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary for more than half a century and thus considerably delayed the expansion of the Ottoman Empire.
The Pope celebrated the victory as well, and he previously ordered all Catholic kingdoms to pray for the victory of the defenders of Belgrade. This led to the noon bell ritual that is still undertaken in Catholic and old Protestant churches to this day.
Since 2011, the date 22 July, when Christian forces led by John Hunyadi defeated the Ottoman Turks besieging Belgrade in 1456, is a national memorial day in Hungary.Anniversary of 1456 victory over Ottomans becomes memorial day politics.hu

[[Ice cream van]]
CATEGORIES: Ice cream, Vans, Types of restaurants, Street culture, Food trucks

An ice cream van (British) or ice cream truck (American) is a commercial vehicle which serves as a travelling retail outlet for ice cream, usually during the summer. Ice cream vans are often seen parked at public events, or near parks, beaches, or other areas where people congregate. Ice cream vans often travel near where children play — outside schools, in residential areas, or in other locations. They usually stop briefly before moving on to the next street.
Ice cream vans are often brightly decorated and carry images of ice cream, or some other adornment, such as cartoon characters. They may have painted-on notices, which can serve a commercial purpose ("Stop me and buy one!") or a more serious one ("Don't Skid on a Kid!") - serving as a warning to passing motorists that children may run out into the road at the sight of the van, or appear without warning from behind it. Along the sides, a large sliding window acts as a serving hatch, and this is often covered with small pictures of the available products, with their associated prices. A distinctive feature of ice cream vans is their melodic chimes, and often these take the form of a famous and recognizable tune, usually "The Mister Softee Jingle", "Turkey in the Straw", "Do Your Ears Hang Low?, "Pop Goes The Weasel" "The Entertainer", "Music Box Dancer", "Home on the Range", "It's a Small World", "Super Mario Bros. theme" or "Camptown Races"; or, in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, "Greensleeves", "Whistle While You Work" in Crewe and Nantwich, "You Are My Sunshine" in Vale Royal, "Teddy Bears' Picnic" in Sheffield, and "Match of the Day" in other places. In some places in the US, ice cream trucks play the song "Ice Cream" by Andre Nickatina (essentially just Turkey in the Straw with bass).
Most ice cream vans tend to sell both pre-manufactured ice lollies (American English: popsicles) in wrappers, and soft serve ice cream from a machine, served in a cone, and often with a chocolate flake (in Britain) or a sugary syrup flavoured with, for example, strawberry. Soft serve ice cream is served topped with sprinkles for a slight extra charge. While franchises or chains are rare within the ice cream truck community (most trucks are independently owned/run), there are a few chains.
In some locations, ice cream van operators have diversified to fill gaps in the market for soft drinks, using their capacity for refrigerated storage to sell chilled cans and bottles.
Early ice cream vans carried simple ice cream, during a time when most families did not own a freezer.  As freezers became more commonplace, ice cream vans moved towards selling novelty ice cream items, such as bars and popsicles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.serving-ice-cream.com/ice-cream-trucks.html|title=Ice Cream Trucks|publisher=Serving Ice Cream|accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]  Early vans used relatively primitive techniques: their refrigeration was ensured by large blocks of dry ice so the engine was always turned off when the van was stopped for sales. The chimes were operated by a hand driven crank or a take-off from the engine, so they were not heard as often. Modern chimes are always electrically operated and amplified.

CATEGORIES: Ghost towns in California, Mining communities in California, Former settlements in Inyo County, California, Populated places in the Mojave Desert, Unincorporated communities in California, Populated places established in 1869

Swansea is an unincorporated community in Inyo County, California. It is located [tpl]convert|8.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of New York Butte,[tpl]California's Geographic Names|1206[/tpl] at an elevation of [tpl]convert|3661|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl].
Swansea was a boomtown located on the eastern shore of Owens Lake. Spawned by the success of the silver mining operations in the nearby Cerro Gordo Mines in the late 1860s, Swansea became a hub for smelting the ore and transporting the resulting ingots to Los Angeles, over 200 miles away. The smelter operated from 1869 to 1874.
Swansea was named after the mining town Swansea in south Wales, from which many experienced miners emigrated to the United States.
The 1872 Lone Pine earthquake damaged the smelters and uplifted the shoreline, rendering the Swansea pier inaccessible by Owens Lake steamships. As a result, most of the smelting and transportation business moved to Keeler, approximately one mile to the south.
In the summer of 1874, a thunderstorm-induced debris flow inundated Swansea under several feet of water, rock, and sand.Likes, Robert C., "From This Mountain", 1975, Sierra Media Inc. By then the town had been almost deserted, and the debris flow marked the end of Swansea.
As of 2007, only one building and a smelter foundation remained alongside Route 136 (about 10 miles southeast of Lone Pine).

[[Coalbed methane]]
CATEGORIES: Methane, Coal, Unconventional gas, Alternative fuels

Coalbed methane (CBM or coal-bed methane),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bg-group.com/Careers/graduates/howtoapply/Pages/JargonBuster.aspx|title=Jargon Buster|publisher=BG Group|accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl] coalbed gas, coal seam gas (CSG), or coal-mine methane (CMM) is a form of natural gas extracted from coal beds.Coal Gas, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 25.11.2011 In recent decades it has become an important source of energy in United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries.
The term refers to methane adsorbed into the solid matrix of the coal. It is called 'sweet gas' because of its lack of hydrogen sulphide. The presence of this gas is well known from its occurrence in underground coal mining, where it presents a serious safety risk. Coalbed methane is distinct from a typical sandstone or other conventional gas reservoir, as the methane is stored within the coal by a process called adsorption. The methane is in a near-liquid state, lining the inside of pores within the coal (called the matrix). The open fractures in the coal (called the cleats) can also contain free gas or can be saturated with water.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Unlike much natural gas from conventional reservoirs, coalbed methane contains very little heavier hydrocarbons such as propane or butane, and no natural-gas condensate. It often contains up to a few percent carbon dioxide. Some coal seams, such as those in certain areas of the Illawarra Coal Measures in NSW, Australia, contain little methane, with the predominant coal seam gas being carbon dioxide.[tpl]cite web|title=Briefing Note - Lord Mayor - Response to SRACSG - Coal Seam Methane|url=http://www.nogasmininginsydney.com/Briefing%20Note%20-%20Lord%20Mayor-%20Response%20to%20SRACSG%20-%20Coal%20Seam%20Methane.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl]

[[Social Alternative]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 2004, Neo-fascist organisations in Italy

Social Alternative ([tpl]lang-it|Alternativa Sociale[/tpl]) was a coalition of far-right political parties in Italy. 
The coalition grew from Social Action, which was founded by Benito Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini after she left the National Alliance due to their attempts to move away from the party's fascist past.
Mussolini united her group with the Social Action for the 2004 European Parliament election, gaining one seat in the European Parliament. The group was committed to a strong Italian nationalism that celebrated and glorified its past, and has been particularly critical of Gianfranco Fini's modernisation of the right.
For the 2005 regional elections, also the Tricolour Flame joined the alliance, only to leave it some months later.
In the 2006 Italian general elections the coalition was a member of the defeated House of Freedoms and won no seats. The alliance was disbanded in late 2006 and replace by a new pact between Social Action, New Force, the Social Idea Movement and the National Volunteers.

Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink (1 December 1864 – 21 April 1934) was an Anglo-Norwegian polar explorer and a pioneer of modern Antarctic travel. He was the precursor of Robert Falcon Scott, Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen and other more famous names associated with the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. He began his exploring career in 1894 by joining a Norwegian whaling expedition, from which he brought back a collection of the first specimens of vegetable life within the Antarctic Circle.
In 1898–1900 Borchgrevink led the British-financed Southern Cross Expedition, which in 1899 became the first to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland and the first to visit the Great Ice Barrier since the expedition of Sir James Ross nearly sixty years previously. Borchgrevink landed on the Barrier with two companions and made the first sledge journey on its surface, setting a new Farthest South record at 78°50'S. On its return to England, notwithstanding its array of "firsts", the expedition was received with only moderate interest by the public and by the British geographical establishment, whose attention was fixed on Scott's upcoming National Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink's colleagues were critical of his leadership, and his own accounts of the expedition were regarded as journalistic and unreliable.
After the Southern Cross Expedition, Borchgrevink was one of three scientists sent to the Caribbean in 1902 by the National Geographic Society, to report on the aftermath of the Mount Pelée disaster. Thereafter he settled in Oslo, leading a life mainly away from public attention. His pioneering work was subsequently recognised and honoured by several countries, and in 1912 he received a handsome tribute from Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole. In 1930 Britain's Royal Geographical Society finally acknowledged Borchgrevink's contribution to polar exploration and awarded him its Patron's Medal. The Society admitted in its citation that justice had not previously been done to his work with the Southern Cross Expedition.

The Geological Society of America (or GSA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement of the geosciences.  The society was founded in New York in 1888 by Alexander Winchell, John J. Stevenson, Charles H. Hitchcock, John R. Procter and Edward OrtonEditor (26 August 1938) "The Semi-Centennial Meeting of the Geological Society of America" Science (New Series) 88(2278):  p. 183 and has been headquartered at 3300 Penrose Place, Boulder, Colorado, USA, since 1972.  The stated mission of GSA is "to advance geoscience research and discovery, service to society, stewardship of Earth, and the geosciences profession". Its main activities are sponsoring scientific meetings and publishing scientific literature, particularly the journals Society of America Bulletin (commonly called "GSA Bulletin") and Geology. A more recent publication endeavor is the online-only journal Geosphere. In February 2009, GSA began publishing Lithosphere. GSA's monthly news and science magazine, GSA Today'', is open access online.
The society has six regional sections in North America, an international section, and seventeen specialty divisions.
GSA began with 100 members under its first president, James Hall.  Over the next 43 years it grew slowly but steadily to 600 members until 1931, when a $4 million endowment from 1930 president R.A.F. Penrose, Jr. jumpstarted the GSA's growth. As of April 2013, GSA has more than 25,000 members in over 100 countries.

CATEGORIES: Documents, Conspiracy theories, Non-fiction books about the John F. Kennedy assassination

The Gemstone File is a conspiracy theory document attributed to Bruce Porter Roberts. In 1975, "A Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File" appeared and is generally attributed to Stephanie Caruana. The "Key" is purportedly a synopsis of Roberts' documents that presents a chronicle of interlocking conspiracies, including claims that world events since the 1950s were shaped by suppressed information, the names of supposed shooters of President John F. Kennedy, and suggested connections between a number of political assassinations which occurred within a relatively short time frame. Authors James McConnachie and Robin Tudge called it "the original mega-conspiracy theory."

[[Capital punishment in Canada]]
CATEGORIES: Capital punishment in Canada, Human rights in Canada

Capital punishment in Canada dates back to 1759, in its days as a British colony. Before Canada eliminated the death penalty for murder on July 14, 1976, 1,481 people were sentenced to death, with 710 executed. Of those executed, 697 were men and 13 were women. The only method used in Canada for capital punishment of civilians after the end of the French regime was hanging. The last execution in Canada was the double hanging of Arthur Lucas and Ronald Turpin on December 11, 1962, at Toronto's Don Jail.
On June 30, 1987, a bill to restore the death penalty was defeated by the House of Commons in a close 148-127 vote, in which Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Minister of Justice Ray Hnatyshyn and Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark opposed the bill, whereas Deputy Prime Minister Donald Mazankowski and a majority of Progressive Conservative MPs supported it.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/society/crime-justice/the-death-penalty-debate/abolition-upheld.htmlhttp://www.ccadp.org/deathpenalty-canada.htmhttp://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1127764--majority-of-canadians-support-return-of-death-penalty-poll-findshttp://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-02-14/news/8701100413_1_capital-punishment-death-penalty-special-committee

Construct validity is “the degree to which a test measures what it claims, or purports, to be measuring.”[tpl]cite book |last=Brown |first=J.

Nursing Research: Generating and Assessing Evidence for Nursing Practice, 9th ed. Philadelphia, USA: Wolters Klower Health, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins In the classical model of validity, construct validity is one of three main types of validity evidence, alongside content validity and criterion validity.[tpl]cite journal |last=Guion |first=R.

D. |year=1996 |title=Testing in language programs |publisher=Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall Regents[/tpl] Modern validity theory defines construct validity as the overarching concern of validity research, subsuming all other types of validity evidence.[tpl]cite journal |last=Messick |first=S. |year=1995 |title=Validity of psychological assessment: Validation of inferences from persons’ responses and performances as scientific inquiry into score meaning |journal=American Psychologist |volume=50 |pages=741–749[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Schotte |first=C.

Construct validity is the appropriateness of inferences made on the basis of observations or measurements (often test scores), specifically whether a test measures the intended construct. Constructs are abstractions that are deliberately created by researchers in order to conceptualize the latent variable, which is the cause of scores on a given measure (although it is not directly observable). Construct validity examines the question: Does the measure behave like the theory says a measure of that construct should behave?
Construct validity is essential to the perceived overall validity of the test. Construct validity is particularly important in the social sciences, psychology, psychometrics and language studies.
Psychologists such as Samuel Messick (1989) have pushed for a unified view of construct validity “…as an integrated evaluative judgment of the degree to which empirical evidence and theoretical rationales support the adequacy and appropriateness of inferences and actions based on test scores…”[tpl]cite journal |last=Messick |first=Samuel |year=1998 |title=Test validity: A matter of consequence |journal= Social Indicators Research |volume= 45 |issue=1-3 |pages= 35–44.[/tpl] Key to construct validity are the theoretical ideas behind the trait under consideration, i.e. the concepts that organize how aspects of personality, intelligence, etc. are viewed.[tpl]cite book |last=Pennington |first=Donald |year=2003 |title=Essential Personality. |publisher=Arnold. |ISBN= 0-340-76118-0[/tpl] Paul Meehl states that "The best construct is the one around which we can build the greatest number of inferences, in the most direct fashion."

[[Predictive validity]]
CATEGORIES: Validity (statistics)

In psychometrics, predictive validity is the extent to which a score on a scale or test predicts scores on some criterion measure.Cronbach, L.J., & Meehl, P.E. (1955). Construct validity for psychological tests. Psychological Bulletin, 52, 281-302.http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Cronbach/construct.htmThe Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project.
For example, the validity of a cognitive test for job performance is the correlation between test scores and, for example, supervisor performance ratings.  Such a cognitive test would have predictive validity if the observed correlation were statistically significant. 
Predictive validity shares similarities with concurrent validity in that both are generally measured as correlations between a test and some criterion measure. In a study of concurrent validity the test is administered at the same time as the criterion is collected. This is a common method of developing validity evidence for employment tests: A test is administered to incumbent employees, then a rating of those employees' job performance is, or has already been, obtained independently of the test (often, as noted above, in the form of a supervisor rating). Note the possibility for restriction of range both in test scores and performance scores: The incumbent employees are likely to be a more homogeneous and higher performing group than the applicant pool at large.
In a strict study of predictive validity, the test scores are collected first; then at some later time the criterion measure is collected. For predictive validity, the example is slightly different: Tests are administered, perhaps to job applicants, and then after those individuals work in the job for a year, their test scores are correlated with their first year job performance scores. Another relevant example is SAT scores: These are validated by collecting the scores during the examinee's senior year and high school and then waiting a year (or more) to correlate the scores with their first year college grade point average. Thus predictive validity provides somewhat more useful data about test validity because it has greater fidelity to the real situation in which the test will be used. After all, most tests are administered to find out something about future behavior.
As with many aspects of social science, the magnitude of the correlations obtained from predictive validity studies is usually not high. A typical predictive validity for an employment test might obtain a correlation in the neighborhood of r=.35. Higher values are occasionally seen and lower values are very common. Nonetheless the utility (that is the benefit obtained by making decisions using the test) provided by a test with a correlation of .35 can be quite substantial.

Order and Justice ([tpl]lang-lt|Tvarka ir teisingumas[/tpl], TT), formerly the Liberal Democratic Party (Liberalų Demokratų Partija, LDP), is a right-wing national liberal political party in Lithuania, though it self-identifies as 'left-of-centre'. It has eleven members of the Seimas.
Formed as the 'Liberal Democratic Party' in 2002, the party achieved almost immediate success with the election of leader Rolandas Paksas as President of Lithuania within its first year.  Paksas's impeachment led to the party reorganising itself as 'Order and Justice' to compete in the 2004 parliamentary election.  Since then, it has been the fourth-largest party in the Seimas, and finished third in the elections to the European Parliament and to the presidency.
The party sits on the centre-right, possesses a radical and anti-establishment identity, and is described as both socially conservative[tpl]cite journal |last=Jurkynas |first=Mindaugas |date=June 2009 |title=The parliamentary election in Lithuania, October 2008 |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=329–33 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2009.02.001 [/tpl] and 'liberal', in line with its original identity.  Its support is strongest in the north-west Samogitia region.  Its faction in the Seimas also includes the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania.  The party's two MEPs sit in the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group in the European Parliament, with the party having previously belonged in the now-defunct AEN.

It flows easterly through Damflask Reservoir and is joined by Storrs Brook at Storrs, near Stannington, and the River Rivelin at Malin Bridge, before flowing into the River Don at Owlerton, in Hillsborough. The Loxley valley provided the initial course of the Great Sheffield Flood, which happened after the Dale Dyke Dam collapsed shortly before its completion in March 1864.

Andrew Stevenson (January 21, 1784 – January 25, 1857) was a Democratic politician in the United States. Educated at the College of William and Mary, he married three times. His second wife, Sarah (Sally) Coles, was a cousin of Dolley Madison and sister of Edward Coles, a governor of Illinois. Stevenson served as a Congressman from Virginia from 1821 to 1834 and was the Speaker of the House from 1827 until 1834. From 1836 to 1841 Stevenson served as American minister to the United Kingdom. He presided over the 1835 Democratic National Convention and the 1848 Democratic National Convention. From 1856 to 1857 he served as rector of the University of Virginia.
His term as Minister to the United Kingdom was marked by controversy: the abolitionist cause was growing in strength, and some  sections of public opinion resented the choice of  Stevenson, who was a slaveowner, for this role.Geoghegan, Patrick M.  Liberator- the Life and Death of Daniel O'Connell  Gill and Macmillan 2010 Dublin p.202  The Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell was reported to have denounced Stevenson in public as a slave breeder, generally thought to be a more serious matter than  simply being a slaveowner.Geoghegan pp.202-4 Stevenson, outraged, challenged O'Connell to a duel, but O'Connell, who had a lifelong aversion to dueling, refused, and suggested  that he had been misquoted. The controversy became public and the repeated references to slave breeding caused Stevenson a good deal of embarrassment: there was a widespread view that if O'Connell's charges were false Stevenson would have done better to simply ignore them rather than engaging in a public squabble.Geoghegan p.204
Stevenson purchased the Blenheim property in Albemarle County in 1846.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Albemarle/002-0005%20-%20Blenheim%20-%201976%20-%20Final%20Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Blenheim |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff |date=December 1975[/tpl] and Accompanying photo It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.[tpl]NRISref|version=2010a[/tpl]

[[Specific performance]]

CATEGORIES: Contract law, Equity (law), Judicial remedies

Specific performance is an order of a court which requires a party to perform a specific act, usually what is stated in a contract. It is an alternative to awarding damages, and is classed as an equitable remedy commonly used in the form of injunctive relief concerning confidential information or real property.  While specific performance can be in the form of any type of forced action, it is usually used to complete a previously established transaction, thus being the most effective remedy in protecting the expectation interest of the innocent party to a contract. It is usually the opposite of a prohibitory  injunction but there are mandatory injunctions which have a similar effect to specific performance.
Under the common law, specific performance was not a remedy, with the rights of a litigant being limited to the collection of damages.  However, the court of equity developed the remedy of specific performance as damages often could not adequately compensate someone for the inability to own a particular piece of real property, land being regarded as unique. Specific performance is often guaranteed through the remedy of a right of possession, giving the plaintiff the right to take possession of the property in dispute.  However, in the case of personal performance contracts, it may also be ensured through the threat of proceedings for contempt of court.
Orders of specific performance are granted when damages are not an adequate remedy, and in some specific cases such as land sale. Such orders are discretionary, as with all equitable remedies, so the availability of this remedy will depend on whether it is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

The River Rivelin is a river in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.
It rises on the Hallam moors, in north west Sheffield, and joins the River Loxley (at Malin Bridge). The Rivelin Valley, through which the river flows, is a three and a half mile long woodland valley which includes the popular Rivelin Valley Nature Trail that was created in 1967. The valley has farmland on its gentler upper slopes.
A relatively fast-flowing river (it drops 80 metres between Rivelin Mill Bridge and Malin Bridge), the Rivelin is fed by a constant release of water from the nearby moorland peat. Its flow was exploited for centuries as a power source, driving the water wheels of up to twenty industries (forges, metal-working and flour mills) along its course.

Porphyry of Tyre ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔr|f|ə|r|i[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc-gre|Πορφύριος[/tpl], Porphyrios, AD c. 234 – c. 305) was a Neoplatonic philosopher who was born in Tyre.For Porphyry's dates, place of birth and philosophical school, see Barker 2003. Sarton 1936, pp. 429-430, identifies Transjordania as Porphyry's place of birth. He edited and published the Enneads, the only collection of the work of his teacher Plotinus. He also wrote many works himself on a wide variety of topics.Topics range from music to Homer to vegetarianism. For a comprehensive list see Beutler (1894-1980). His Isagoge, or Introduction, is an introduction to logic and philosophy,Barnes 2003, p. xv clarifies that the Isagoge "was not an Introduction to the Categories, rather "it was an introduction to the study of logic, it was... an introduction to philosophy--and hence accidentally an introduction to the Categories." and in Latin translation it was the standard textbook on logic throughout the Middle Ages.See Barnes 2003, p. ix. In addition, through several of his works, most notably Philosophy from Oracles and Against the Christians, he was involved in a controversy with a number of early Christians,See Digeser 1998. and his commentary on Euclid's Elements was used as a source by Pappus of Alexandria.See O'Connor and Robertson, "Porphyry Malchus".

Sigeberht (Sigeberht means roughly 'Magnificent Victory') was the King of Wessex from 756 to 757.
Sigeberht succeeded his distant relative Cuthred, but was then accused of acting unjustly.  He was removed from power by a council of nobles, but given control of Hampshire.  There, he was accused of murder, driven out and ultimately killed.  It is possible that this happened under the influence of Æthelbald of Mercia.  His brother Cyneheard was also driven out, but returned in 786 to kill Sigeberht's successor Cynewulf.

[[Cutter (baseball)]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball pitches, Baseball plays

In baseball, a cutter, or cut fastball, is a type of fastball which breaks slightly toward the pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate.[tpl]cite web|first=Albert|last=Chen|title=This Is The Game Changer|date=June 13, 2011|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1187105/index.htm|accessdate=2011-06-09[/tpl] This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball. Some pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs. A common technique used to throw a cutter is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand. When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot. The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfx.texasleaguers.com/league-averages.php|title=League Average PITCHf/x Data - TexasLeaguers.com|publisher=Texas Leaguers|accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl]

[[Sodium sulfate]]

CATEGORIES: Sulfates, Sodium compounds, Desiccants, Alchemical substances, Articles containing video clips, Photographic chemicals

Sodium sulfate is the sodium salt of sulfuric acid. When anhydrous, it is a white crystalline solid of formula Na2SO4 known as the mineral thenardite; the decahydrate Na2SO4·10H2O is found naturally as the mineral mirabilite, and in processed form has been known as Glauber's salt or, historically, sal mirabilis since the 17th century. Another solid is the heptahydrate, which transforms to mirabilite when cooled. With an annual production of 6 million tonnes, it is a major commodity chemical product.
Sodium sulfate is mainly used for the manufacture of detergents and in the Kraft process of paper pulping. About two-thirds of the world's production is from mirabilite, the natural mineral form of the decahydrate, and the remainder from by-products of chemical processes such as hydrochloric acid production.

The Roxbury Latin School is the oldest school in continuous operation in North America.School history: Schola Illustris: The Roxbury Latin School 1645-1995, David R. Godine, publisher The school was  founded in Roxbury, Massachusetts by the Rev. John Eliot under a charter received from King Charles I of England. Since its founding in 1645, it has educated boys on a continuous basis.
Located since 1927 at 101 St. Theresa Avenue in the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, the school now serves about 290 to 300 boys in grades seven through twelve. Eliot founded the school "to fit students for public service both in church and in commonwealth in succeeding ages," and the school continues to consider instilling a desire to perform public service among its principal missions.
The school's endowment is estimated at $105 million http://www.roxburylatin.org/about-rl/rl-fact-sheet/index.aspx Roxbury Latin School Fact Sheet  the largest of any boys' day school in the United States.  The school maintains a need-blind admissions policy, admitting boys without consideration of the ability of their families to pay the full tuition.
Its previous headmaster, F. Washington Jarvis, who retired in the summer of 2004 after a 30-year tenure, published two books about Roxbury Latin: a history of the school and a collection of his speeches to boys at Roxbury Latin (With Love and Prayers).  The title of the former, Schola Illustris, was the phrase Cotton Mather used to describe the school in 1690, following John Eliot's death.  In addition to those books, Richard Walden Hale published Tercentenary History of the Roxbury Latin School in 1946.  Roxbury Latin continues to hold a unique place in the history of American education.
Roxbury Latin School is a member of the Independent School League and NEPSAC. It has an unofficial sister school relationship with The Winsor School in Boston as well as an African brother school, the Maru a Pula School.

[[Fitting lemma]]
CATEGORIES: Module theory, Lemmas

The Fitting lemma, named after the mathematician Hans Fitting, is a basic statement in abstract algebra. Suppose M is a module over some ring. If M is indecomposable and has finite length, then every endomorphism of M is either bijective or nilpotent.
As an immediate consequence, we see that the endomorphism ring of every finite-length indecomposable module is local.
A version of Fitting's lemma is often used in the representation theory of groups. This is in fact a special case of the version above, since every K-linear representation of a group G can be viewed as a module over the group algebra KG.

Sandra Lee Scheuer ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɔɪ|.|ər[/tpl]; August 11, 1949 - May 4, 1970) was a student at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, when she was killed by Ohio National Guardsmen in the Kent State shootings.
Scheuer, born in Youngstown, Ohio, was an honors student in speech therapy. She was a graduate of Boardman High School. She did not take part in the Vietnam War protests that preceded the shootings. She was shot through the throat with an M-1 rifle from a distance of 130 yards (119 m) while walking between classes and died within five or six minutes from loss of blood. According to the account of Bruce Burkland, a close family friend, Scheuer "was walking with one of her speech and hearing therapy students across the green. Neither Sandra nor the young man had anything to do with the assembly of students on the green."Burkland, Bruce (n.d.).  Testimony on May 4 Archive website Three other unarmed students were also killed in the shootings: Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, and William Knox Schroeder. 
The shootings led to protests and a national student strike, causing hundreds of campuses to close because of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war.
Scheuer had been a member of the Alpha Xi Delta sorority,[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.alphaxi.org/heritage_timeline.asp| title = Heritage Timeline - 1970| publisher = Alpha Xi Delta | accessdate =2007-08-15[/tpl] and current members of this sorority speak in her memory each year on the Kent State University campus at the May 4 Task Force's commemoration of the 1970 tragedy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]
Just after Scheuer's death, the English songwriter Harvey Andrews composed a song titled "Hey Sandy",Hey Sandy on YouTube" whose lyrics are addressed to her:
In the song "Ohio", which was written immediately after the shootings, folk rocker Neil Young made a reference to Scheuer through the eyes of Tom Grace who was walking with her to her next class.  Grace was also wounded from an ankle shot. In the chorus:
Scheuer is also remembered in Canadian poet Gary Geddes' poem "Sandra Lee Scheuer", found in his 1980 collection The Acid Test,Gary Geddes' "Sandra Lee Scheuer" from The Acid Test, 1980Gary Geddes as well as the Polaris song also called "Hey Sandy", which served as the theme song to the television series The Adventures of Pete & Pete.

The Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC), known in Ojibwe as Gnoozhekaaning or Place of the Pike, is an Indian reservation forming the land base of one of the many Sault Ste. Marie bands of Chippewa Indians. (Not to be confused with the "Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians" located in Sault Ste. Marie, MI). The largest section of the reservation is located in Chippewa County, Michigan, approximately 15 miles (25 km) west-southwest of Sault Ste. Marie, in Bay Mills Township and Superior Township. A smaller section lies southeast of Sault Ste. Marie in western Sugar Island Township.
With the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934, the Bay Mills Indian Community (BMIC) was one of the four original reservations established in Michigan. In 1937, land was purchased for Bay Mills and the BMIC was organized with the adoption of their Constitution and Charter on November 27, 1937 in accordance with the IRA. These lands, along with the original Bay Mills Mission and a small area on Sugar Island, comprise the majority of the current reservation land holdings in Chippewa County. 
The area within the reservation boundaries is in U.S. trust status and is divided into two separate areas. As of the 2000 census the majority of the land base, [tpl]convert|3.761|sqmi|km2[/tpl], lies northwest of Brimley, Michigan, in the eastern parts of Bay Mills Township and Superior Township, while the remainder, 1.032 square miles (2.674 km² or 660.67 acres), lies on Sugar Island in the St. Marys River. Its total land area at that time was [tpl]convert|4.793|sqmi|km2[/tpl] on which a population of 812 persons resided. The Tribe has also obtained additional land in the last few years, increasing the land base to approximately 3,494 acres (5.46 sq mi; 14.14 km²), of which 3,109 acres (4.86 sq mi; 12.58 km²) are in trust.
The BMIC consists of approximately 1,309 registered members. It is governed by the General Tribal Council, which consists of all voting-age members of the tribe. Daily decisions are made by the Executive Council, which consists of five elected officials (president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, councilman). 
Bay Mills Community College is an accredited tribal college operated by the community.
The tribe also operates the Bay Mills Resort & Casino.
Since the mid-1990s, the tribe has been working in concert with casino syndicator Michael J. Malik, Sr. and Detroit businesswoman Marian Ilitch. Originally Malik and partners had proposed the tribe, in partnership with Harrah's, pursue a casino in the area of Downtown Detroit referred to as Foxtown.  Then Michigan voters narrowly approved a ballot measure in 1996 permitting three larger commercial casinos in Detroit.  For almost a decade the partners have been working together pursuing land claims in the Hay Lake/Charlotte Beach area on the eastern shores of Michigan's northern peninsula that would be traded in settlement agreements for more lucrative casino sites in Port Huron or elsewhere. The voters of Port Huron approved of the Bay Mills casino in 2001.  While the agreements were signed by the Governor of Michigan and approved by the legislature, they have stalled in Congress -- Representative Candice Miller (MI-10th) has introduced HR. 831 and Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow had previously introduced S.2986

CATEGORIES: Petroleum engineering, Economic geology, Geophysics societies, Seismology, Petroleum geologists, Non-profit organizations based in Oklahoma, Organizations established in 1930

The Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the science of geophysics and the education of exploration geophysicists. The Society fosters the expert and ethical practice of geophysics in the exploration and development of natural resources, in characterizing the near-surface, and in mitigating earth hazards. As of early 2008, SEG has more than 28,000 members working in more than 130 countries. SEG was founded in 1930 in Houston, Texas but its business office has been headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma since the mid-1940s. While most SEG members are involved in exploration for petroleum, SEG members also are involved in application of geophysics methods to mineral exploration as well as environmental and engineering problems, archaeology, and other scientific endeavors. SEG publishes The Leading Edge (TLE), a monthly professional magazine, and Geophysics, a peer-reviewed archival publication.
SEG's Technical Standards Committee develops and maintains specifications for geophysical data. Most familiar of these standards are the SEG Y data format for storing seismic data.

[[Convex combination]]
CATEGORIES: Convex geometry, Mathematical analysis, Convex hulls

In convex geometry, a convex combination is a linear combination of points (which can be vectors, scalars, or more generally points in an affine space) where all coefficients are non-negative and sum to 1.
As a particular example, every convex combination of two points lies on the line segment between the points.
All convex combinations are within the convex hull of the given points. In fact, the collection of all such convex combinations of points in the set constitutes the convex hull of the set.

[[Latitudinarian]]

CATEGORIES: Anglicanism, Christian terms

Latitudinarian was initially a pejorative term applied to a group of 17th-century English theologians who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Good examples of the latitudinarian philosophy were found among the Cambridge Platonists and Sir Thomas Browne in his Religio Medici. Additionally, the term has been ascribed to ministers of the Scottish Episcopal Church in Scotland who were educated at the Episcopal sympathizing universities at Aberdeen and St Andrews and that broadly subscribed to their moderate Anglican English counterparts.[tpl]cite book|last=Landsman|first=Ned|title=From Colonials to Provincials, American Thought and Culture 1680 - 1760|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca[/tpl]
Currently, latitudinarianism should not be confused with ecumenical movements, which seek to draw all Christian churches together, rather than to de-emphasize practical doctrine. The term has taken on a more general meaning, indicating a personal philosophy which includes being widely tolerant of other views, particularly (but not necessarily) on religious matters.
In the Roman Catholic Church, latitudinarianism was condemned in the 19th century document Quanta Cura, because Pope Pius IX felt that this attitude was undermining the Church, with its high emphasis on religious liberty and possibility to discard traditional Christian doctrines and dogmas. Latitudinarianism is still commonly criticized under the epithet of Cafeteria Catholic.

[[STU-III]]

CATEGORIES: National Security Agency encryption devices, Secure telephones

STU-III is a family of secure telephones introduced in 1987 by the NSA for use by the United States government, its contractors, and its allies. STU-III desk units look much like typical office telephones, plug into a standard telephone wall jack and can make calls to any ordinary phone user (with such calls receiving no special protection, however).  When a call is placed to another STU-III unit that is properly set up, one caller can ask the other to initiate secure transmission (or, colloquially, to "go secure").  They then press a button on their telephones and, after a 15 second delay, their call is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.  There are portable and militarized versions and most STU-IIIs contained an internal modem and RS-232 port for data and fax transmission. Vendors were AT&T (later transferred to Lucent Technologies), RCA (Now L-3 Communications, East) and Motorola.
STU-III are no longer in service with the U.S. Government, with the last cryptographic keys for the units expiring on December 31, 2009.  It has been replaced by the STE (Secure Terminal Equipment) and other equipment using SCIP, the more modern Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol.STU-III Phase Out, L3 Communications

CATEGORIES: West Saxon monarchs, 756 deaths, 8th-century English monarchs, Year of birth unknown, House of Wessex

Cuthred or Cuþræd was the King of Wessex from 740 (739 according to Simeon of Durham, 741 according to John of Worcester) until 756.  He succeeded Æthelheard, his relative and possibly his brother.
Cuthred inherited the kingdom while Mercia was at its peak. The two kingdoms often fought, but it appears that Æthelbald of Mercia was Wessex's overlord and that Æthelbald compelled Cuthred to join him in fighting the Welsh in 743.
Cuthred's reign was a troubled time.  In 748, Cuthred's aetheling Cynric, possibly his son, was killed (according to Henry of Huntingdon in a mutiny), while in 750 the ealdorman Æthelhun led an unsuccessful rebellion.
In 752, Cuthred led a successful rebellion against Æthelbald at Battle Edge in Burford and secured independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign.  He is also said to have fought the Cornish in 753.

[[Homo sacer]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient Roman religion, Crime and punishment in ancient Rome, Emergency laws, Human rights, Latin language, Latin legal terms, Philosophical concepts, Philosophy of law, Roman law, Caste, Sacrifice

Homo sacer (Latin for "the sacred man" or "the accursed man") is a figure of Roman law: a person who is banned, may be killed by anybody, but may not be sacrificed in a religious ritual.Agamben, Giorgio. Heller-Roazen, trans. Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998. 72. 
The meaning of the term sacer in Ancient Roman religion is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as sacred. In early Roman religion sacer, much like Hebrew [tpl]Hebrew|קֹדֶשׁ[/tpl] qōdeš, denotes anything "set apart" from common society and encompasses both the sense of "hallowed" and that of "cursed". The homo sacer could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all rights and all functions in civil religion. Homo sacer is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed.Giorgio Agamben - Homo Sacer, 1995 (Valdisholm publishing company, Norwegian translation), 2. part (Homo Sacer) 1.1.  referring Sextus Pompeius Festus. The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. In the case of certain monarchs in western legal traditions, the sovereign and the Homo Sacer have conflated.§ 5 Constitution of Norway -
The status of homo sacer could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An oath in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or several deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods in whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.
A direct reference to this status is found in the Twelve Tables (8.21), laws of the early Roman Republic written in the 5th century BC. The paragraph states that a patron who deceives his clients is to be regarded as sacer.
The idea of the status of an outlaw, a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persists throughout the Middle Ages, medieval perception condemning the entire human intrinsic moral worth of the condemned outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a "wolf" or "wolf's-head" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element)Mary R. Gerstein, Berkeley, Ca., 1974, "Germanic Warg: The Outlaw as Werwolf", in G.J. Larson, ed., Myth in Indo-European Antiquity, p. 132 and is first revoked only by the English Habeas Corpus act of 1679 which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.
Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben takes the concept as the starting point of his main work Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (1998).

Wortley Top Forge is an historic former finery forge and ironworks originally dating back to the seventeenth century, although evidence suggests iron working took place in the vicinity as early as the fourteenth century. It is situated in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, England, on a loop of the River Don near to the village of Wortley.
The Top Forge was always closely related to Wortley Low Forge, a short distance downstream.  One of the forges was probably built about 1639 (possibly both of them) and certainly existed by 1641, from which time the Iron-masters at Wortley were Thomas Cotton, and his son William Cotton (1627-1674);Letter from the Corporation of Doncaster, 1674, enquiring into how much “iron had been delivered to their wharf during the preceding fourteen years by Mr Cotton of Watley Forge." Archives. the latter being the father of Thomas Cotton (Dissenting minister).  Cannon balls are said to have been made here during the English Civil War.  After that the finery forges usually belonged to a network of ironmasters led by members of the Spencer family of Cannon Hall, Cawthorne, but not between 1676 and 1690, when they were rented by other ironmasters.  The two forges were always leased together with a blast furnace, Nether Bank Furnace until the latter's closure probably about 1780, all of them being rented from the Wortley family.  
In 1744, the forge was let to John Cockshutt (died 1774), who ran it with a partner.  He also had a 'tinmill'. He was followed by his son, another John, who was succeeded by his brother James about 1800.  James had worked at Merthyr Tydfil as a partner of William Crawshay in the Cyfarthfa Ironworks and when he returned to Wortley in 1791 after the dissolution of their partnership, he introduced puddling to Wortley, the tinmill probably being altered to roll blooms into bars of iron.  After James' death in 1820, the works passed to relatives and then through various hands, coming into the hands of Thomas Andrews in 1849.  On his death in 1871 he was followed by his son another Thomas Andrews, who died in 1907.  
One of the buildings at Top Forge includes as date stone for 1713. However, the current layout of the building dates from the 1850s when the forge was turned over to the production of shafts and axles mainly for use on railway wagons.  Some of the earliest metallurgical experiments in the world were conducted at the site by the engineer and metallurgist Thomas Andrews.  Railway axles of the highest quality were manufactured at the site in the nineteenth century and exported all over the world.
Production ceased around 1912, but parts of the site remained in use until 1929.  One of the Top Forge hammers was run as a demonstration in 1933 or 1934.  In 1955, the dream of C. R. Andrews (the son of the second Thomas) was fulfilled, the forge being reopened as an Industrial Museum by Sheffield Trades Historical Society (now South Yorkshire Industrial History Society).  Its buildings are used to house a variety of industrial machinery, including a Marshall twin-cylinder engine steam engine.  
Also of particular interest is that the site only ever used waterwheels to power the machinery. All three waterwheels have been restored to working order.

The Sopwith Triplane was a British single seat fighter aircraft designed and manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company during the First World War. Pilots nicknamed it the Tripehound or simply the Tripe.Bowers and McDowell 1993, p. 62. The Triplane became operational with the Royal Naval Air Service in early 1917 and was immediately successful. The Triplane was nevertheless built in comparatively small numbers and was withdrawn from active service as Sopwith Camels arrived in the latter half of 1917. Surviving aircraft continued to serve as operational trainers until the end of the war.

[[NFL Network]]
CATEGORIES: English-language television stations in the United States, Television channels and stations established in 2003, NFL Network, Sports television networks in the United States

NFL Network (NFLN) is an American television sports channel dedicated to American football, owned and operated by the National Football League (NFL). It was launched November 4, 2003, only eight months after the league's 32 team owners voted unanimously to approve its formation. The league invested $100 million to fund the network's operations.
NFL Films produces commercials, television programs, and feature films for the NFL. It is a key supplier of NFL Network's programming, with more than 4,000 hours of footage available in their library. Thus, much of the network's highlights and recaps feature NFL Films' trademark style of slow motion game action, sounds of the game, and the talk on the sidelines.
Beginning with the 2006 season, the channel began to broadcast eight prime time regular season NFL games, currently running under the banner of Thursday Night Football. In addition to live games, the network has covered the NFL Draft since 2006; its coverage has competed with ESPN and ESPN2.
The NFL Network logo changed to match the new NFL logo, which premiered officially at the 2008 NFL Draft. Unlike the updated logo for the league, the NFL Network's new logo saw more subtle changes such as using a darker shade of blue and changing the "NFL" lettering to match that of the new NFL logo. The day of the 2012 NFL Draft, the network changed the logo to resemble that of their sister network NFL Red Zone, and also played down the "HD" branding of the network as of late, as effectively all cable providers currently carry the analog 4:3 version of the channel as a downscaled version of the HD feed, including letterboxing of all programming.
The NFL Network works from studios in Culver City, California, near Los Angeles, and broadcasts their worldwide feed from Encompass Digital Media (formally Crawford Communications) in Atlanta, GA.Crawford distributes NFL Network via satellite services Broadcast Engineering November 28, 2008
Starting with the 2010 season,  the channel started broadcasting the Arena Football League. Each Friday, the NFL Network had a Game of the Week, going through the playoffs and culminating with the ArenaBowl. Also beginning in 2010, the channel began to broadcast 14 regular season Canadian Football League games. It would also air the Grey Cup.
As of August 2013, NFL Network is received by approximately 70,910,000 American households that subscribe to a pay television service (62.09% of U.S. households with television).[tpl]cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/23/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-networks-is-in-cable-network-coverage-estimates-as-of-august-2013/199072/ |title=List of How Many Homes Each Cable Networks Is In - Cable Network Coverage Estimates As Of August 2013 |last=Seidman |first=Robert |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=August 23, 2013 |accessdate=September 6, 2013[/tpl]

[[Gros Islet Quarter]]
CATEGORIES: Quarters of Saint Lucia

Gros Islet is the newest town in Saint Lucia, having been recently {August 5th, 1985} promoted from a village to a town. It is the location of the Beausejour Cricket Grounds where both One Day International and Test Cricket is played. Parts of the 2007 Cricket World Cup and 2010 ICC World Twenty20 were played there. It is the administrative centre of the Gros Island Quarter, a region of Saint Lucia which includes the island's northernmost point, Cap Point.
It lies north of Castries, the capital of Saint Lucia, and features the Friday Night Street Party which is its major tourist attraction. Also known as the jump-up, the Friday Night Street Party encompasses several blocks, which have to be informally cordoned off with the stalls of street vendors. Steamed fish, barbecue chicken and St. Lucia's own Piton beer can be purchased from these vendors. Music can be heard through the old fishing village, and locals and tourist both dance in a central cross section in the small streets to the sounds of calypso, zouk, reggae and R&B.
The Rodney Bay Area further south differs greatly from the small, makeshift housing littering most of the town of Gros-Islet. Catering mostly to the tourism populace, the areas surrounding the marina contain shops, malls, restaurants and night clubs that fall on the higher end of the spectrum compared to other local enterprises. Land development costs in the Rodney Bay area are extremely high. The exclusive beach front properties have almost all been purchased by small and large hoteliers, and restaurateurs, frustrating locals who continually see access to the public beaches being blocked by large construction projects. The night life reveals several clubs all in close proximity vying for clientele. The historic Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia) is a popular place for tourists because of it peacefulness and wildlife. A man made causeway connects it to the mainland.

CATEGORIES: Japanese mathematicians, 20th-century mathematicians, 21st-century mathematicians, Fields Medalists, Algebraic geometers, 1951 births, Living people, People from Nagoya, Kyoto University alumni, Kyoto University faculty, Nagoya University faculty

[tpl]nihongo|Shigefumi Mori|森 重文|Mori Shigefumi|extra=born February 23, 1951[/tpl] is a Japanese mathematician, known for his work in algebraic geometry, particularly in relation to the classification of three-folds.
He generalized the classical approach to the classification of algebraic surfaces to the classification of algebraic three-folds. The classical approach used the concept of minimal models of algebraic surfaces. He found that the concept of minimal models can be applied to three-folds as well if we allow some singularities on them.
The extension of Mori’s results to dimensions higher than three is called the Mori program and, as of 2006, is an extremely active area of algebraic geometry.
He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990 at the International Congress of Mathematicians. 
He was visiting professor at Harvard University during 1977-1980, the Institute for Advanced Study in 1981-82, Columbia University 1985-87 and the University of Utah for periods during 1987-89 and again during 1991-92. He has been a professor at Kyoto University since 1990.

[[Canonical normal form]]
CATEGORIES: Boolean algebra, Logic, Algebraic logic, Articles with example code

In Boolean algebra, any Boolean function can be put into the canonical disjunctive normal form (CDNF) or minterm canonical form and its dual canonical conjunctive normal form (CCNF) or maxterm canonical form.  Other canonical forms include the complete sum of prime implicants or Blake canonical form (and its dual), and the algebraic normal form  (also called Zhegalkin or Reed–Muller).
Minterms are called products because they are the logical AND of a set of variables, and maxterms are called sums because they are the logical OR of a set of variables. These concepts are dual because of their complementary-symmetry relationship as expressed by De Morgan's laws.
Two dual canonical forms of any Boolean function are a "sum of minterms" and a "product of maxterms." The term "Sum of Products" or "SoP" is widely used for the canonical form that is a disjunction (OR) of minterms. Its De Morgan dual is a "Product of Sums" or "PoS" for the canonical form that is  a conjunction (AND) of maxterms. These forms allow for greater analysis into the simplification of these functions, which is of great importance in the minimization or other optimization of Boolean formulas in general and digital circuits in particular.

[[Acidic oxide]]
CATEGORIES: Acidic oxides

Acidic oxides are inorganic chemicals that react with water to form an acid; or react with a base to form a salt. Acidic oxides are oxides of either nonmetals or of metals in high oxidation states.  They are formed when a nonmetal burns. Their chemistry can be systematically understood by taking an oxoacid and removing water from it, until only the oxide is left. The resulting oxide belongs to this group of substances.
Acidic oxides are not Arrhenius acids, nor are they Brønsted–Lowry acids, since they neither accept protons, nor do they increase the hydrogen ion concentration of water. However, they are Lewis acids, since they accept electron pairs from certain Lewis bases, most notably Base anhydrides.Principles of Modern Chemistry, 7th Edition. David Oxtoby, H. P.

The Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (BrE) (also known as Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score (AmE) or simply PGCS) is the equivalent of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) used to assess the mental state of child patients.  As many of the assessments for an adult patient would not be appropriate for infants, the Glascow Coma Scale was modified slightly to form the PGCS.  As with the GCS, the PGCS comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses.  The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible PGCS (the sum) is 3 (deep coma or death) whilst the highest is 15 (fully awake and aware person). The pediatric GCS is commonly used in emergency medical services.

Katharine Brush (August 15, 1902 – June 10, 1952) was an American author.
According to her autobiographical collection of works, This Is On Me (1940) [tpl]OCLC|26043754[/tpl], Katharine Brush was born Katharine Ingham in Middletown, Connecticut. Brush did not attend college, but instead began working as a columnist for the Boston Evening Traveller. During her career she published multiple short stories in serial magazines like College Humor and Cosmopolitan; the best known of these were collected in a book titled Night Club (1929). Brush's works are characterized by her involving narrative style and wit.
Brush was born Katharine Ingham in Middletown, Connecticut on August 15, 1902. She first attracted attention in the 1920s with her short stories published under her married name, Katherine Brush. Her story "Him and Her" (published in Collier's Weekly March 16, 1929) was an O. Henry Award winner named "Best Short Short" of 1929.  She also received honorable mentions for her short stories in 1927 ("Night Club" Harper's Magazine September 1927), 1931 ("Good Wednesday", Harpers), and 1932 ("Football Girl", College Humor, October 1931). Her short short story "The Birthday Party" is frequently taught in literature classes.
Brush's novel Young Man of Manhattan was named the 9th best-selling novel of 1930  by Publishers Weekly and later that year was made into a film starring Claudette Colbert, Norman Foster, and Ginger Rogers.  Brush, however, is probably best known today for her subsequent novel Red-Headed Woman, which was made into a film in 1932 starring Jean Harlow which remains a pre-code classic for its racy humor.
Her first husband was Thomas Stewart Brush, son of Louis H. Brush of Brush-Moore Newspapers.THOMAS STEWART BRUSH; Director of Newspaper Chain in Ohio Dies in Tucson at 42, The New York Times, October 31, 1938
Twice married and the mother of one child, Brush died in New York City a few months before what would have been her 50th birthday.
Her son, Thomas S. Brush, gave a new library in her name to the Loomis Chaffee School of Windsor, CT, in 1968. The building, designed by architect Kenneth DeMay of Hideo Sasaki's firm Sasaki, Dawson, DeMay Associates (now Sasaki Associates), is still in use today at the school. The building contains a life-size portrait of Katharine Brush looking down at a line of study carrels. A portion of the building was renovated in 2003.
Her short story Birthday Party appeared on the 2005 Advanced Placement English Literature Exam; the story was originally published in The New Yorker's Fiction section in 1946. Brush's Connecticut home was featured on an episode of HGTV's "If Walls could Talk".

[[A Defence of General Funston]]

CATEGORIES: Essays by Mark Twain, Philippine–American War, Spanish–American War

A Defence of General Funston is a satirical piece written by Mark Twain lampooning US Army General and expansionism advocate Frederick Funston.  Funston had been a colonel during the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, and Twain had been an outspoken critic of these wars, as immoral ventures of the American state into the imperialist subjugation of foreign peoples and territories.
In the piece, Twain essentially excoriates Funston as a scoundrel for the tactics he employed in capturing the Filipino president Emilio Aguinaldo, while at the same time facetiously arguing that Funston is not responsible for any of his actions since it was not Funston himself but his "inborn disposition" that determined his actions for him. As this is the only ground upon which Twain makes his "defence", the overall effect is to ironically and comically emphasize Twain's view that Funston's actions were completely indefensible.

Carl H. Storck (born January 22, 1887 – March 13, 1950) was a co-founder of the National Football League, as well as the founding owner of the Dayton Triangles. He was also the Triangles coach from 1922 until 1926. Storck served as the secretary-treasurer of the NFL from 1921 to 1939. Upon the death of Joe Carr, he served as president of the National Football League. Citing ill health, Storck only held the title of president until 1941.
Storck started his football career as a local football hero in Dayton, Ohio, playing for St. Mary's College (now known as the University of Dayton). After graduation, Stork played semi-pro football for a local team that would later become the Dayton Triangles. Storck became the team's manager in 1918 and guide his team into the NFL (then called the American Professional Football Association). He represented Dayton at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile dealership on September 17, 1920. This meeting marked the formation of the NFL. Like nearly all managers, Storck was an unpaid volunteer; he also worked full-time as a foreman in the Inspection and Packing Department at the National Cash Register Company.
The Triangles would have trouble competing in the increasingly competitive NFL, and Storck would eventual sell them in 1930 to Bill Dwyer, who moved the team to Brooklyn and renamed them the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Clarence Joseph "C. J." Bulliet (March 16, 1883 – October 20, 1952) was an American art critic and author.
Bulliet grew up in Corydon, Indiana and graduated in 1904 from Indiana University Bloomington. For nine years he pursued a journalism career in the city of Indianapolis. When Robert Mantell, the head of a Shakespearean touring theatre company, confessed that he liked Bulliet's theater reviews, Bulliet offered to become his press agent. Bulliet traveled in advance of the company throughout the United States and Canada during a period of nine years, except for one year when he was a regional "advance man" (publicist) for D. W. Griffith's silent film The Birth of a Nation (1915). After a brief return to newspaper journalism in Louisville, Kentucky, Bulliet moved to Chicago to edit Magazine of the Art World, a weekly periodical published by the Chicago Evening Post. Art criticism remained his primary occupation even after the Post was assimilated by the Chicago Daily News in 1932.
Bulliet played a central role in popularizing of modern art in the Midwestern United States, and in organizing Chicago's independent artists, who felt snubbed by the conservative tastes that dominated the Chicago Art Institute.
His first book, Robert Mantell's Romance, was published in 1918. His Apples and Madonnas (1927) gained great popularity as an introduction to modern art. Venus Castina (1928) was a pioneering work on female impersonation. The Courtesan Olympia explored relations between artists' models and mistresses. His most popular work was Art Masterpieces of the 1933 Worlds Fair Exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago (1934). His last published book was The Significant Moderns and Their Pictures (1936).
He was married to southern Indiana artist Katherine Adams Bulliet; they had one son, Leander Jackson. After the death of his first wife in 1947 he married Catherine Girdler Bulliet. C. J. Bulliet is the grandfather of historian Richard Bulliet.

[tpl]nihongo|Koichi Tanaka|田中 耕一|Tanaka Kōichi|born August 3, 1959[/tpl] is a Japanese engineer who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002 for developing a novel method for mass spectrometric analyses of biological macromolecules with John Bennett Fenn and Kurt Wüthrich (the latter for work in NMR spectroscopy).[tpl]cite journal |author=Tanaka, K.; Waki, H.; Ido, Y.; Akita, S.; Yoshida, Y.; Yoshida, T. |title=Protein and Polymer Analyses up to m/z 100 000 by Laser Ionization Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry |journal=Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom |volume=2 |issue=20 |pages=151–3 |year=1988|doi=10.1002/rcm.1290020802[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jce.divched.org/JCEWWW/Features/eChemists/document.php?chemid=62 |title=Biographical Snapshots of Famous Women and Minority Chemists: Snapshot |accessdate=2008-08-18 [/tpl]
Tanaka was born and raised in Toyama, Japan. He attended Toyama Chubu High School in Toyama City. In 1983, he graduated from Tohoku University with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, he joined Shimadzu Corporation, where he engaged in the development of mass spectrometers.
For mass spectrometry analyses of a macromolecule, such as a protein, the analyte must be ionized and vaporized by laser irradiation. The problem is that the direct irradiation of an intense laser pulse on a macromolecule causes cleavage of the analyte into tiny fragments and the loss of its structure. In February 1985, Tanaka found that by using a mixture of ultra fine metal powder in glycerol as a matrix, an analyte can be ionized without losing its structure. His work was filed as a patent application in 1985, and after the patent application was made public reported at the Annual Conference of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan held in Kyoto, in May 1987 and became known as soft laser desorption (SLD).[tpl]cite web | last =Markides | first =K | authorlink = | coauthors =Gräslund, A | title =Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 | work = | publisher = | url =http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2002/chemadv02.pdf | format =PDF | doi = | accessdate = [/tpl]
However, there was some criticism about his winning the prize, saying that contribution by two German scientists, Franz Hillenkamp and Michael Karas was also big enough not to be dismissed, and therefore they should also be included as prize winners. This is because they first reported in 1985 a method, with higher sensitivity using a small organic compound as a matrix, that they named Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI).[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Karas, M.; Bachmann, D.; Hillenkamp, F. |title=Influence of the Wavelength in High-Irradiance Ultraviolet Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry of Organic Molecules |journal=Anal.

[/ref] Also Tanaka's SLD is not used currently for biomolecules analysis, meanwhile MALDI is widely used in mass spectrometry research laboratories. But while MALDI was developed prior to SLD, it was not used to ionize proteins until after Tanaka's report.[tpl]cite journal |author=Karas M, Hillenkamp F |title=Laser desorption ionization of proteins with molecular masses exceeding 10,000 daltons |journal=Anal.

CATEGORIES: United States primetime network television schedules, 1963 in American television, 1964 in American television

This was the television schedule on all three networks for the fall season beginning in September 1963. 
ABC began its new fall schedule a week early, beating CBS and NBC out of the starting gate. New series debuting this week included sci-fi anthology The Outer Limits, police/lawyer series Arrest and Trial, drama The Fugitive, and game show 100 Grand. ABC also completely revamped its Friday night schedule, with three new series: detective show Burke's Law, sitcom The Farmer's Daughter, and boxing program The Fight of the Week. Fight would mark the end of boxing on network television. Boxing had debuted on network TV in 1946 and had enjoyed a run on all networks at various times, but after September 11, 1964, boxing would disappear entirely from network television.
CBS's success with rural comedies The Andy Griffith Show and The Beverly Hillbillies had convinced the network that rural sitcoms would continue to be popular. As a result, CBS president James Aubrey added what some critics described as an "endless procession of country clones of the wildly successful Beverly Hillbillies" to the network's schedule. Petticoat Junction, from the same producers  of Hillbillies, debuted on September 24.[tpl]cite book| last = Castleman| first = Harry| authorlink = |author2= Walter J.

Westerns continued to be popular on television, and all three networks scheduled several Western series. NBC, in particular, retained a number of Westerns on its fall 1963 schedule: two returning series The Virginian and Bonanza, and new series Temple Houston, and Redigo. NBC's Western-heavy schedule would pay off, as Bonanza again became the second highest-rated TV series in the Nielsen ratings that year; The Virginian reached #17. CBS's Gunsmoke reached #20.

The Treaty of Córdoba established Mexican independence from Spain at the conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence. It was signed on August 24, 1821 in Córdoba, Veracruz, Mexico. The signatories were the head of the Army of the Three Guarantees, Agustín de Iturbide, and acting on behalf of the Spanish government, Jefe Político Superior Juan O'Donojú.

The College of Sociology ("Collège de Sociologie" in French) was a loosely-knit group of French intellectuals, named after the informal discussion series that they held in Paris between 1937 and 1939, when it was disrupted by the war. 
Founding members include some of France's most well-known intellectuals of the interwar period, including Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois, Pierre Klossowski, Jules Monnerot, Pierre Libra and Georges Ambrosino. Participants also included, Hans Mayer,Refugees in France by this time. Jean Paulhan, Jean Wahl, Michel Leiris, Alexandre Kojève and André Masson. Walter Benjamin was invited to give lectures, but these never materialized.Esther Leslie, Walter Benjmain (London, UK; Reaktion Books, 2007).
The members of the College were united in their dissatisfaction with surrealism. They believed that surrealism's focus on the unconscious privileged the individual over society, and obscured the social dimension of human experience. 
In contrast to this, the members of the College focused on "Sacred Sociology, implying the study of all manifestations of social existence where the active presence of the sacred is clear." The group drew on work in anthropology and sociology which focused on the way that human communities engaged in collective rituals or acts of distribution such as potlatch. It was here, in moments of intense communal experience, rather than the individualistic dreams and reveries of surrealism, that the College of Sociology sought the essence of humanity. 
The group met for two years and lectured on many topics, including the structure of the army, the Marquis de Sade, English monarchy, literature, sexuality, Hitler, and Hegel. This focus, and in particular their interest in indigenous cultures, was part of a wider trend towards primitivism of the time.

[[Muntz Car Company]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United States, Companies based in Evanston, Illinois, Companies based in Glendale, California

The Muntz Car Company was created in Glendale, California by Earl "Madman" Muntz, a well known local used car dealer and electronics retailer. It was in existence from 1950 to 1954.Flory,  J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1016. Muntz was assisted by Frank Kurtis, who had earlier attempted to produce a sports car under the Kurtis Kraft marque (the Kurtis Kraft Sport, which sold just 36 units by 1950).[ref]
</ref>
In 1951, Kurtis sold the license to manufacture the cars to Muntz, who quickly rebadged them as the "Muntz Jet", extended the body to make it a 4-seater, and exchanged the Ford engine with a larger Cadillac V8. Later, this engine would be replaced with a less expensive Lincoln side-valve V8.Lillywhite, David. The Encyclopedia of Classic Cars. (Thunder Bay Press, 2003)
The car, a sports coupe, was manufactured in Chicago, IL in the 2900 block of N. Sheffield Av. and featured its own unique design, with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top that were manufactured in-house. Other parts (such as the engines) were sourced from other manufacturers. It was capable of 112 mph, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. It was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of Popular Science (with a Jaguar and an MG).
The company managed to produce only about 400 cars during 1951-1954, and due to the high manufacturing cost, Muntz himself estimated that his company lost about $1,000 on each car; this financial drain eventually caused him to close the company.
Because the cars were distinctive in design, well-built and good performers for their time, Muntz Jets today are rare and valuable collector pieces.

[[IPIX]]

IPIX (IPIX Corporation, successor-in-interest to Internet Pictures Corporation, Bamboo.com Inc., Omniview Inc., and TeleRobotics International) was an imaging technology company headquartered in Reston, Virginia. One of its products was visual technology allowing the stitching of panoramic images into 360°x 180° field of view video and photography.  The company's stock was traded on NASDAQ (IPIXQ).
Their .ipx format was for a time a widely used virtual image type for hotel and real estate websites. 'IPIX Interactive Studio', could create IPIX's proprietary format, QuickTime Cubic VR images, Equirectangular and Cylindrical Projections as JPEGs that could be viewed with Helmut Dersch's freeware Java PTViewer, Shockwave w3d files, VRML files and X3D files. Two plug-ins are available that can create images in the RealViz format and iSeeMedia's PhotoVista format.
IPIX licensing method was as follows. The proprietary IPIX software "IPIX Wizard" could seam any number of fisheyes (or retouched fisheyes) into a .ipx and would only allow viewing of the image for quality control purposes. When the user wanted to save the .ipx file he or she would "spend" an IPIX key. These keys could be purchased from the IPIX store for $25 each, or less if purchased in bulk. Resellers could purchase these keys and offer IPIX services while charging more than $25 per sold .ipx picture. Minds-Eye-View ("MEV"), the company that bought what remained of IPIX continued this licensing method and continues to use the IPIX name.
IPIX patented its Omniview motionless camera orientation system, and has claimed that this patent covered techniques for creating 360-degree images using two fish-eye photographs. It pursued an active policy of filing patent lawsuits against any company or individual that developed similar technologies, Helmut Dersch and the company Infinite Pictures being the most notable examples.The IPIX "Fisheye" Patent The company also filed lawsuits against photographers using software it considered to be infringing its patents. The company was widely criticized for these lawsuits.Page of links on the lawsuits controversy Among the arguments against the patent claims were the existence of prior art, and that these lawsuits have acted to put a damper on the development of interactive immersive image technologies. It was also argued that some of their claims are too broad, suggesting that any geometric remapping of a fisheye image is their invention.Exhaustive comment In the end it turned out that IPIX itself was in violation of a prior patent held by Pictosphere, and in court attempted to use the same defense that had been used against them in the past. They lost the suit.IPIX lost the patent war with Pictosphere
On July 31, 2006, IPIX filed for bankruptcy after posting a 3.8 million dollar loss IPIX petition for voluntary bankruptcy3.8 million dollar loss for the first part of 2006. They had posted a $347 million loss in the tech crash in 2001.
Before going bankrupt IPIX had finished developing a technology called i-movies or vPix, streaming video in 360 degrees again without moving cameras. The technology could allow an infinite number of viewers to "move" their own camera and viewing space in a live televised event. The technology was not further marketed.
On January 19, 2007, it auctioned off a block of 28 patents for $3.6 million, to an anonymous bidder which later revealed itself to be Sony.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/04/AR2007020401109.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Kim | last=Hart | title=Sony Wins Bid for Ipix Camera Technology Patents | date=February 5, 2007[/tpl]

It is located on the Pyrzyce-Stargard Plains, on the west bank of the river Płonia, and has roughly 1400 inhabitants.
The area has been inhabited since at least the times of the Lusatian culture. In 1173 it was donated to the Cistercian order (originally of Denmark). Between 1210 and 1347 a large monastery (Kołbacz Abbey) and several farms were built in the area to house the monks. In sources known as Colbatz, Kolbatz, Colbas, sometimes Mera Vallis which means Bright Valley. After the secularization of Pomeranian Cistercians in 1555 the area became a private property of the Dukes of Pomerania-Stettin, the monastery was converted into a castle and then into a summer residence of the dukes. The rulings of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653) assigned Kolbatz to Brandenburg, which later became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Since 1815 it was within the Province of Pomerania. After 1945, it became part of Poland.
Among the most notable historical attractions are remnants of Cistercian abbey, which include a Romanesque-Gothic church (1210–1347), one of the oldest brick churches in Pomerania. There are also remnants of the monastery itself, as well as a converts' house, abbot's house, a gothic barn and a fortified tower.

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. is an American chain of combined restaurant and gift stores with a Southern country theme. The company was founded by Dan Evins in 1969; its first store was in Lebanon, Tennessee, which remains the company headquarters. The chain's  stores were at first positioned near highway exits in the Southeastern and Midwestern US, but it expanded across the country during the 1990s and 2000s.

Cracker Barrel's menu is based on traditional Southern cuisine, with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned general store. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a stone fireplace, and artifacts from the local area. Cracker Barrel is known for its partnerships with country music performers, and has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of Hurricane Katrina and injured war veterans.
During the 1990s, the company was the subject of controversy for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African American and female employees. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation found Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the Department of Justice, Cracker Barrel has implemented non-discrimination policies, and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.

Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda (April 30, 1914 – May 21, 1977) was a Brazilian journalist and politician. 
Born in Rio de Janeiro, Lacerda was the son of a family of politicians from Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro state.
When he was a law student, Lacerda became sympathetic to left-wing ideas, but by the 1940s he had transformed into a staunch anti-communist conservative.
He started his journalism career at Diário de Notícias (English: News Daily) in 1929. In 1949 he founded the newspaper Tribuna da Imprensa (English: Press Tribune).
Starting his political career in 1947, Lacerda was elected to the legislative chamber (city council) of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 he was elected a UDN party representative for the state of Rio in the Chamber of Deputies. He became well known for his uncompromising opposition of the government of President Getúlio Vargas, even demanding Vargas' overthrow.
He survived an assassination attempt in August 1954 which became known as the crime of Rua Tonelero. The attempt is widely believed by historians to have been made by men acting under the orders of Gregório Fortunato, O Anjo Negro (Portuguese for "The Black Angel"), a Black man who was the head of Vargas' personal bodyguards. Brazilian Air Force Major Rubens Vaz was killed in the attempt and Lacerda was slightly injured. This sparked a political crisis that culminated with the suicide of Vargas.
Lacerda was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies later in 1954 with the most votes of any candidate. He also opposed the government of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira.
Lacerda was elected governor of Guanabara State (Rio de Janeiro city) in 1960. His administration was praised for his efforts to solve some chronic problems of Rio such as water services, public transportation and housing. 
An opinionated and controversial politician, Lacerda was involved in the crisis of the resignation of President Jânio Quadros in 1961 and conspired against the presidency of João Goulart. Hoping to be elected president in the 1965 elections, Lacerda initially supported the military coup d'état of 1964 and was nominated the UDN candidate. Since the military was not willing to give up power, the 1965 elections were cancelled and Lacerda began to oppose the regime. In 1968, due to his efforts to restore democracy in Brazil by allying with his old enemies Kubitschek and Goulart, Lacerda was arrested for a brief period and stripped of his right to run for political office for 10 years. After that, he retired from politics and resumed his journalism and publishing career. In 1977 he died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro.

CBS and ABC, still mostly in black and white, continued rolling out rural sitcoms; in fall 1964 the networks added Gomer Pyle, USMC (CBS) and No Time For Sergeants (ABC) to their respective  schedules. According to television historians Castleman and Podrazik (1982), critics objected to CBS's rural sitcom-heavy schedule, particularly the Gomer Pyle character, but the "high ratings earned by the silly gimmicks and simpleton heroes would assure rural sitcoms spots in the network schedules for years."
Castleman and Podrazik also point out the large number of "escapist" programs which debuted during fall 1964: Gilligan's Island (CBS), Bewitched (ABC), My Living Doll (CBS), The Addams Family (ABC) and The Munsters (CBS). Only NBC avoided the escapist trend during the season.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), is a systemic disorder that involves both granulomatosis and polyangiitis.

[[Dog watch]]

CATEGORIES: Nautical terms

Dog watch, in marine or naval terminology, is a watch, a period of work duty or a work shift, between 16:00 and 20:00 (4 pm and 8 pm).  This period is split into two, with the 'first' dog watch from 16:00 to 18:00 (4 pm to 6 pm) and the 'last' dog watch from 18:00 to 20:00 (6 pm to 8 pm) (there is no 'second' dog watch although the term can be used as in The Sea Wolf by Jack London, chapter 6:... (rest) I can steal near the end of the second dog watch). Each of these watches is half the length of a standard watch.
The reason behind this watch's existence is that, in order for the crew to rotate through all the watches, it was necessary to split one of the watches in half, to create an odd number of watches in a ship's day. This allowed the sailors to stand different watches instead of one team being forced to stand the mid-watch every night. The choice of time also allows both watches, if there are only two, to eat an evening meal at about the traditional time.[tpl]cite web|title=Workshop Hints: Ships Bells|url=http://www.bhi.co.uk/aHints/ships.html|work=The British Horological Institute|accessdate=12 June 2011|author=Tony Gray|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110612045510/http://www.bhi.co.uk/aHints/ships.html|archivedate=9 November 2012[/tpl]
The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word 'dogwatch' is a direct translation from either German or Dutch of a similar term. It originally referred to the night-watch on ships — that is, the time when (on land) all but the dog were asleep."dogwatch, n.", Oxford English Dictionary. The name is also said to be derived from Sirius, the "Dog Star", on the claim that Sirius was the first star that can be seen at night.[tpl]cite web|title=Maths & DT|url=http://www.hms-victory.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=143|publisher=HMS-Victory.com|accessdate=14 November 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080717011259/http://www.hms-victory.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=143|archivedate=17 July 2008[/tpl] An alternative folk etymology is that the name arose because someone tasked with one of these 'half' watches was said to be 'dodging the watch', taking or standing the 'dodge watch'. This became shortened to 'dog watch'.  Another variation is that those sleeping get only 'dog sleep' in this watch. Stephen Maturin of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series makes the pun that the dog watch is so-named because it is "cur-tailed" ("curtailed", i.e. shortened).

[[Amphibious warfare]]
CATEGORIES: Warfare by type, Amphibious warfare

Amphibious warfare is a type of offensive military operation that uses naval ships to project ground and air military power onto a hostile or potentially hostile shore.Speller, Ian & Tuck, Christopher, Amphibious warfare, Strategy and tactics series, Spellmount, 2001, p.7 Through history the operations were conducted using ship's boats as the primary method of delivering troops to shore. Since the Gallipoli Campaign specialised watercraft were increasingly designed for landing troops, materiel and vehicles, including by landing craft and for insertion of commandos, by fast patrol boats, zodiacs (rigid inflatable boats) and from mini-submersibles.
The term amphibious first emerged in the USA during the 1930s after design of the Landing Vehicle Tracked where the first prototypes were named Alligator and Crocodile, though neither species are amphibian. Amphibious warfare includes operations defined by their type, purpose, scale and means of execution. In the British Empire at the time these were called combined operations which were defined as "...operations where naval, military or air forces in any combination are co-operating with each other, working independently under their respective commanders, but with a common strategic object."Harding, Richard, The Royal Navy, 1930-2000: Innovation And Defense, Taylor & Francis, 2005, p.44 All armed forces that employ troops with special training and equipment for conducting landings from naval vessels to shore agree to this definition.
Since the 20th century an amphibious landing of troops on a beachhead is acknowledged as the most complex of all military manoeuvres. The undertaking requires an intricate coordination of numerous military specialities, including air power, naval gunfire, naval transport, logistical planning, specialised equipment, land warfare, tactics, and extensive training in the nuances of this manoeuvre for all personnel involved.

The Highway Emergency Response Operators program is a freeway service patrol operated in metro Atlanta, USA by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT).  It is a part of GDOT's Office of Traffic Operations.  Both the program and the individual vehicles are typically referred to by the bacronym HERO.  The program began in Atlanta in 1994 and has since been expanded in association with GDOT's Navigator Intelligent Transportation System program.
The HERO unit's primary purpose is to minimize traffic congestion by clearing wrecked or disabled vehicles from the roadway lanes and providing traffic control at incident scenes.  As a secondary service, HERO's function as a service patrol; assisting stranded motorists who may have a flat tire or are out of fuel.  In addition to their normal duties in metro Atlanta, HEROs have been deployed in the past to assist with traffic control at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia and along Interstates 75 and 16 during hurricane evacuations. 
HERO truck operators are GDOT employees, distinguishing the program from freeway service patrols in other states, such as California, which are operated under contract by private tow truck companies.  The HERO day is split into four shifts - Alpha (morning), Bravo (afternoon), Charlie (weekend) and Delta (overnight).   The program operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Typically, HEROs work between 55,000 and 60,000 incidents per year.
Motorists needing HERO assistance may dial 511 (and press 1) to reach a HERO dispatcher. 511 is also the number for general traffic information throughout the state of Georgia.

[[Front-runner]]
CATEGORIES: Elections

Front-runner is a term to describe the leaders in a race, whether political or athletic.  The term arose from the close symbolism between political campaigns and athletic running events.  The term is used in the U.S. Presidential primary process to label the potential nominee with the lead in the polls, the most name recognition, or most funds raised (or a combination of these).
The front-runner is most often anointed by the media who are following the race, and is written about in a different style than his or her challengers. 
Front-runner can also be used to describe a type of sports fan who likes only the team that is winning. Also known as a fairweather fan, the person will quickly, and repeatedly change allegiance with athletes and teams as teams and players become "good" or "bad" based on records.

[[Aplite]]

CATEGORIES: Felsic rocks, Phaneritic rocks

Aplite [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|l|aɪ|t[/tpl] in petrology, the name given to intrusive rock in which quartz and feldspar are the dominant minerals. Aplites are usually very fine-grained, white, grey or pinkish, and their constituents are visible only with the help of a magnifying lens. Dykes and threads of aplite are commonly observed traversing granitic bodies; they occur also, though less frequently, in syenites, diorites, quartz-diabases and gabbros.
Aplites usually have a genetic affinity to the rocks they intersect. The aplites of granite areas, for example, are the last part of the magma to crystallize, and correspond in composition to the quartzo-feldspathic aggregates that fill up the interspaces between the early minerals in the main body of the rock. They bear a considerable resemblance to the eutectic mixtures which are formed on the cooling of solutions of mineral salts, and remain liquid till the excess of either of the components has separated out, finally solidifying en masse when the proper proportions of the constituents and a suitable temperature are reached.
The essential components of aplites are quartz and alkali feldspar (the latter usually orthoclase or microperthite), microcline and albite. Crystallization has been apparently rapid (as the rocks are so fine-grained), and the ingredients have solidified almost at the same time. Hence their crystals are rather imperfect and fit closely to one another in a sort of fine mosaic of nearly equi-dimensional grains. Porphyritic feldspars occur occasionally and quartz more seldom; but the relation of the aplites to quartz-porphyries, granophyres and felsites is very close, as all these rocks have nearly the same chemical composition.
The aplites associated with diorites and quartz-diabases differ in minor respects from the common aplites which accompany granites. The accessory minerals of these rocks are principally oligoclase, muscovite, apatite and zircon. Biotite and all ferromagnesian minerals rarely appear in them, and never in considerable amounts. Riebeckite-granites have close affinities to aplites, shown especially in the prevalence of alkali feldspars. Tourmaline also occurs in some aplites.
The rocks of this group are very frequent in all areas where masses of granite are known. They form dykes and irregular veins which may be only a few inches or many feet in diameter. Less frequently aplite forms stocks or bosses, or occupies the edges or irregular portions of the interior of outcrops of granite. The syenite-aplites consist mainly of alkali feldspar; the diorite-aplites of plagioclase; there are nepheline-bearing aplites which intersect some elaeolite-syenites. In all cases they bear the same relation to the parent masses. By increase of quartz, aplites pass gradually, in a few localities, through highly quartzose modifications into quartz veins.

[[Reserve clause]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball labor relations, Sports law, Contract clauses

In North American professional sports, the reserve clause was part of a player contract that stated upon the contract's expiration, the rights to the player were to be retained by the team.  This meant the player was not free to enter into another contract with another team. Once signed to a contract, re-assigned, traded, sold, or released at the teams whim. The only negotiating leverage that most players had was to hold out at contract time, refusing to play unless their conditions were met. The player was bound to either negotiate a new contract to play another year for the same team, or ask to be released or traded. The player had no freedom to change teams unless he was given his unconditional release. Unconditional release is when a team no longer needs that player. In the days of the reserve clause, this was the only way a player could be a free agent. [tpl]cite web|title=Reserve Clause|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/reserve_clause|accessdate=25 March 2014[/tpl]  
Once common in sports, the clause was abolished in baseball in 1975. The reserve clause system has, for the most part, been replaced by free agency.

Diego Dominguez (born 25 April 1966 in Córdoba, Argentina) is a  former Argentine rugby union fly-half who played for Argentina and Italy, winning 74 caps for the latter.
In 1986 Dominguez toured France with the Argentine national team, but saw his opportunities lacking by Hugo Porta. He scored 27 points in two games for Argentina. Because of the little opportunities, he decided that he would turn to Italy, his mother's homeland. After the tour with Argentina, he played for a year in France, and then moved to Milan in Italy.
Dominguez then made his Italian debut in March 1991 against France. Dominguez played for the Azzurri at fly-half in three world cups in 1991, 1995 and 1999. He is one of only five players (Dan Carter, Jonny Wilkinson, Ronan O'Gara, and Neil Jenkins) in history to have scored more than 1,000 points.
In 1997 he moved to Stade Français and was part of the French champions' 1998 side. Stade also reached the final of the Heineken Cup in 2001 but despite Dominguez kicking 30 points, they lost to Leicester Tigers.
He announced his retirement in 2000 but was persuaded to return as there was no heir apparent. He played his last game for Italy on 22 February 2003 against Ireland.

Brazilian geneticist Sérgio Pena has criticised American scholar Edward Telles for lumping "pretos" and "pardos" in the same category.

Commanded by Lieutenant William Lewis, she left Boston for the Mediterranean on 19 June and was with Capt. John Rodgers' squadron of 13 warships when it appeared off Tunis on 1 August. Impressed by the American show of force, the Bey of Tunis elected to accept American peace terms, and Vengeance did not see action.

CATEGORIES: Artist groups and collectives

An art group refers to an association of artists who may work (or live) communally, for the purpose of facilitating the creation of art, either that belonging to the individual, or the collective. 
Art groups typically were formed by established artists, such as Andy Warhol, as hired assistants to the artist, operating collectively under the artist's studio. More recently, art groups have been formed by unknown artists, pooling their limited resources toward the collective goal.
Groups have formed as political action groups, to work on political advocacy projects, while other groups formed simply for reasons of working and living in an environment conducive to the peculiar interests of artists. In this context, some groups began to create collective works of art, music, writing, etc., under the name of their group.

[[Ramesses IV]]

CATEGORIES: Pharaohs of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt, Ancient Egyptian mummies

Heqamaatre Ramesses IV (also written Ramses or Rameses) was the third pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. His name prior to assuming the crown was Amonhirkhopshef. He was the fifth son of Ramesses III and was appointed to the position of crown prince by the twenty-second year of his father's reign when all four of his elder brothers predeceased him.Jacobus Van Dijk, 'The Amarna Period and the later New Kingdom' in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, ed. Ian Shaw, Oxford University Press paperback, 2002, p.306 His promotion to crown prince:
As his father's chosen successor the Prince employed three distinctive titles: "Hereditary Prince", "Royal scribe" and "Generalissimo"; the latter two of his titles are mentioned in a text at Amenhotep III's temple at SolebKitchen, Rammeside Inscriptions, Vol. V 372: 16 and all three royal titles appear on a lintel now in Florence, Italy.Kitchen, Rammeside Inscriptions, Vol. V, 373 (3) As heir-apparent he took on increasing responsibilities; for instance, in Year 27 of his father's reign, he is depicted appointing a certain Amenemopet to the important position of Third Prophet of Amun in the latter's TT 148 tomb.G.A. Gaballa & K.A. Kitchen, "Amenemope, His Tomb and Family," MDAIK 37 (1981), pp.164-180Ramesses IV by J. Dunn Amenemope's Theban tomb also accords prince Ramesses all three of his aforementioned sets of royal titles.Gaballa & Kitchen, pp.172-173 & 176-177 Due to the three decade long rule of Ramesses III, Ramesses IV is believed to have been a man in his forties when he took the throne. His rule has been dated to either 1151 to 1145 BC or 1155 to 1149 BC.

The SNK Union of Independents (Czech official title: SNK sdružení nezávislých), or SNK (from the earlier title Sdružení nezávislých kandidátů - Association of Independent Candidates), was a small (rather conservative and liberal) political party (registered as a movement - hnutí by the Czech legislative) in Czech Republic, led since May 2007 by Helmut Dohnálek.
It was founded in 2000 in order to help various non-party affiliated town mayors to take part in regional assembly elections. Later it won two seats in the Senate elections in 2002.
In the 2004 European Parliament Election it stood on a joint ticket with the European Democrats which gained 11% of the vote and elected three MEPs, two of whom are members of the SNK.
In February 2006 the non-parliamentary parties SNK and "European Democrats (ED)" merged. The unified party, led by former Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, is called "SNK European Democrats (SNK ED)". The pro-European and liberal-conservative SNK-ED is represented by three deputies in the European Parliament.

[[The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo]]

CATEGORIES: 1960s American animated television series, 1964 American television series debuts, 1965 American television series endings, Mr. Magoo, English-language television programming, NBC network shows

The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo is an animated television series, produced by United Productions of America, which aired for one season (1964 –1965). The television series was based on the original cartoon of the same name, with Jim Backus reprising the voice over of the role he did on TV: while doing this show, he continued with the prime time show Gilligan's Island.
Unlike the theatrical cartoons, which focused on the extremely nearsighted Quincy Magoo's bumbling, the show featured the Magoo character as an actor in adaptations of such literary classics as Don Quixote and Gunga Din. Each of these roles was played seriously, with few if any references to Magoo's nearsightedness; however, introductory segments in each program featured Magoo backstage stumbling into scenery and talking to props, thus connecting the older cartoons to this series. Some stories were contained in a single half-hour episode, but others ran to two and even four episodes. As UPA did not have its own studio facility the production was farmed out to the Grantray-Lawrence and Format Films studios.
Among the most ambitious adaptations mounted in this format were the four-part Robin Hood, in which he took the role of Friar Tuck; Treasure Island, in which he played the villainous Long John Silver; and a version of Snow White in which he portrayed all seven dwarves (much easier in an animated setting, with no trick photography needed).
The series was inspired by the success of the 1962 television special, Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, a serious remake of the Charles Dickens classic with Magoo playing Ebenezer Scrooge.
The series was re-shown in the early 1970s on early Saturday mornings and the early 1980s as part of certain channels' weekday afternoon cartoon blocs.  Certain episodes  were released on VHS tape, but have since gone out of print. Episodes are currently being aired on Saturday mornings on Me-TV and the Retro Television Network.
The series was originally shown in prime time, and not as part of an animated bloc for juvenile viewers, therefore certain more mature elements were present. These included death threats (William Tell, Robin Hood, Don Quixote, The Three Musketeers, Sherlock Holmes), children in danger (Treasure Island, Gunga Din, William Tell), insanity (Don Quixote, Moby Dick), heroic self-sacrifice (Gunga Din), and realistic (although mostly bloodless) violence including swordplay, shooting, clubbing, drowning, and character deaths (most episodes).

The Imperial name had been used since 1926, but was never a separate make, just the top-of-the-line Chrysler. However, in 1955, the company decided to spin Imperial off as its own make and division to better compete with its rivals, Lincoln and Cadillac.http://www.imperialclub.com/Repair/Lit/Marque/index.htmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng_NV22rAJchttp://www.allpar.com/cars/production/imperial.html Imperial would see new body styles introduced every two to three years, all with V8 engines and automatic transmissions, as well as technologies that would filter down to Chrysler corporation's other models.

[[Awake (Dream Theater album)]]

CATEGORIES: Dream Theater albums, 1994 albums, East West Records albums, Albums produced by Duane Baron, Albums produced by John Purdell

Awake is the third studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on October 4, 1994 through East West Records. It was the last Dream Theater album to feature keyboardist Kevin Moore, who announced his decision to leave the band during the recording of the album.
Much of the material for Awake was written in writing sessions between February and April 1994, during which Dream Theater were under pressure from their record label to produce an album as successful as Images and Words (1992) with a single similar to "Pull Me Under". The label wanted the band to produce a more metal-oriented album, hoping it would be easier to market. John Purdell and Duane Baron produced, engineered and mixed the album. The album's cover, designed by the band, features numerous references to the album's lyrics.
Dream Theater auditioned for keyboardists to replace Moore for the upcoming world tour and eventually hired Derek Sherinian. He had just two weeks to learn two hours of complex music before the tour started. Sherinian initially took up the position on a trial basis and was asked to become a full member during the tour. After the first leg of the tour, vocalist James LaBrie suffered a violent case of food poisoning, severely damaging his vocal cords. His singing became unpredictable, leading LaBrie to become depressed for much of the tour. His voice only started recovering on the tour for Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence in 2002. The Great Hanshin earthquake hit while the band was touring in Japan.
Released at the height of the popularity of grunge music, Awake received mixed reviews; more recent reviews regard the album as one of the band's finest. The album peaked at 32 on the US Billboard 200, the highest position a Dream Theater album would reach on that chart until Systematic Chaos (2007). "Lie", "Caught in a Web" and "The Silent Man" were released as singles but failed to be as successful as "Pull Me Under" had been. The band's record label considered the album a commercial failure, which would lead to the band being pressured to write more radio-friendly songs on their subsequent 1997 studio album, Falling into Infinity.
There is no title track on the album, but the lyric awake appears in the songs "Innocence Faded" and "The Silent Man".

Charles Benjamin "Babe" Adams (May 18, 1882 – July 27, 1968) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1906 to 1926 who spent nearly his entire career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Noted for his outstanding location control, his career average of 1.29 walks per 9 innings pitched was the second lowest of the 20th century; his [tpl]By|1920[/tpl] mark of 1 walk per 14.6 innings was a modern record until [tpl]By|2005[/tpl]. He shares the Pirates' franchise record for career victories by a right-hander (194), and holds the team mark for career shutouts (47); from 1926 to 1962 he held the team record for career games pitched (481).
Adams was born in Tipton, Indiana. He made his Major League debut on April 18, 1906 with the St. Louis Cardinals, taking the loss in a 4-inning start, but did not pitch again for them. In September 1907 his contract was sold to the Pirates, with whom he spent the remainder of his career. After going 12–3 with a 1.11 ERA in the [tpl]By|1909[/tpl] regular season, his first full year, Adams became the star of the 1909 World Series after being named the surprise starter of Game 1 following a tip by National League president John Heydler that Adams' style was similar to that of an AL pitcher against whom the Detroit Tigers had had difficulty. He won three complete game victories – each of them a six-hitter.  With a shutout in Game 7, Adams became the first rookie in World Series history to start and win Game 7, which has only been repeated once in baseball history by John Lackey in 2002.  He was also the only member of that team who would be on the Pirates' World Series champions in 1925. He later won 20 games in both [tpl]By|1911[/tpl] and [tpl]By|1913[/tpl]. An off year in [tpl]By|1916[/tpl] that saw his ERA rise to 5.72 got him farmed out to the Western Association, but late in [tpl]By|1918[/tpl] he found his stride again and rejoined the Pirates, where he stayed until [tpl]By|1926[/tpl].
Adams was known as an excellent control pitcher. On July 17, 1914, he pitched an entire 21-inning game against the New York Giants without allowing a single walk, surrendering only 12 hits, but losing 3–1 on Larry Doyle's home run in the top of the 21st; it is the longest game without a walk in Major League history. Rube Marquard also went the distance for New York to gain the victory, allowing two walks. In [tpl]By|1920[/tpl], Adams allowed only 18 walks in 263 innings.
In his career Adams won 194 games and lost 140. His ERA was 2.76. His last game was on August 11, 1926; he was released days later after joining a group of players who requested that former manager and team vice president Fred Clarke, who had been openly criticizing manager Bill McKechnie, not be permitted to sit on the bench. Adams later managed in the minor leagues, farmed in Mount Moriah, Missouri, and worked as a reporter and foreign correspondent during World War II and the Korean War.
Adams died of throat cancer in Silver Spring, Maryland at age 86.

[[Superior Unit Award]]

CATEGORIES: Awards and decorations of the United States Army, Awards established in 1985

The Superior Unit Award is a decoration of the United States Army which is awarded in peacetime to any unit of the Army which displays outstanding meritorious performance of a difficult and challenging mission carried out under extraordinary circumstances.
The Army Superior Unit Award was created in 1985.  The award is composed of a green and red ribbon, enclosed within a gold frame. 
Background: As part of the Army Cohesion and Stability Study (ARCOST) of 1980, a proposal to adopt the Army Superior Unit Award was forwarded to Major Army Commands (MACOM) for comment on 18 March 1981. This recommendation was based on the fact that present Army unit awards were for combat service only. While all MACOM\ and most of the Army Staff supported the proposal, the leadership elected not to approve the new award. In 1984, the Vice Chief of Staff, Army, directed that a Peacetime Unit Award be developed and submitted for approval. In April 1985, the Secretary of the Army (SECARMY) approved the Army Superior Unit Award for meritorious unit performance of a uniquely difficult and challenging mission under extraordinary circumstances that involved the national interest. As a result of the strict criteria and lack of approving awards, the criteria were changed by SECARMY in July 1986. This change deleted the words "unique" and "national interest". Only two units were awarded the ASUA prior to the revision. The first ASUA was awarded to the 164th Military Police Company, 59th Ordnance Brigade, Miesau, West Germany, in May 1985 for its anti-terrorism work during NATO nuclear operations. The second went to the 3d Battalion, 502d Infantry, 101st Airborne Division. Nearly 200 of the 248 soldiers who were killed in the crash of Arrow Air Flight 1285 in Gander, Newfoundland, were from the battalion and were on their way home in December 1985 from duty with the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai Desert.  Source: United States Army (2009)
On 17 September 1991, in a memorandum to the Secretary of the Army, The Adjutant General (TAG) requested approval to create a lapel pin to be worn by all members of units awarded the Army Superior Unit Award. This recommendation was based on the fact that the award was being presented to units with a significant number of civilians assigned and there was no visible means of recognizing them. This change permitted issue of an emblem to both military and civilian personnel. The Secretary of the Army approved the recommendation on 12 December 1991.  Source: United States Army (2009)
The emblem is worn by all members of a cited organization and is considered an individual decoration for persons in connection with the cited acts and may be worn whether or not they continue as members of the organization. Other personnel may wear this decoration while serving with an organization to indicate the unit has been awarded the Army Superior Unit Award.  Source: United States Army (2009)

Falling Into Infinity is the fourth studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on September 23, 1997 through EastWest Records. It is the band's first and only studio album to feature keyboardist Derek Sherinian following the departure of Kevin Moore in 1994.
Falling into Infinity was produced by Kevin Shirley. The album's writing and pre-production phases were stressful periods for the band, and at one point almost led them to retire. It was recorded in June 1997 at The Power Station (now Avatar Studios) in Manhattan, New York. A commercial and critical failure, the album led to the band demanding to be free from record label interference for all future albums.

[[Noise floor]]

CATEGORIES: Noise

In signal theory, the noise floor is the measure of the signal created from the sum of all the noise sources and unwanted signals within a measurement system, where noise is defined as any signal other than the one being monitored.
In radio communication and electronics, this may include thermal noise, blackbody, cosmic noise  as well as atmospheric noise from distant thunderstorms and similar and any other unwanted man-made signals, sometimes referred to as incidental noise. If the dominant noise is generated within the measuring equipment (for example by a receiver with a poor noise figure) then this is an example of an instrumentation noise floor, as opposed to a physical noise floor. These terms are not always clearly defined, and are sometimes confused.[tpl]cite web|title = Notes on the RSGB Observations of the HF Ambient Noise Floor|publisher = Radio Society of Great Britain|url = http://rsgb.org/main/files/2012/12/EMC_RSGB_HF_Ambient_Noise_Floor_2003.pdf|accessdate = 2014-02-03[/tpl]
Avoiding interference between electrical systems is the distinct subject of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). 
In a measurement system such as a seismograph, the physical noise floor may be set by the incidental noise, and may include nearby foot traffic or a nearby road. The noise floor limits the smallest measurement that can be taken with certainty since any measured amplitude can on average be no less than the noise floor.
A common way to lower the noise floor in electronics systems is to cool the system to reduce thermal noise, when this is the major noise source.  In special circumstances, the noise floor can also be artificially lowered with digital signal processing techniques.
Signals that are below the noise floor can be detected by using different techniques of spread spectrum communications, where signal of a particular information bandwidth is deliberately spread in the frequency domain resulting in a signal with a wider occupied bandwidth.

CATEGORIES: Municipalities of the Province of Cádiz, Populated places in the Province of Cádiz

Medina-Sidonia is a city and municipality in the province of Cádiz in the autonomous community of Andalusia, southern Spain. It is considered by some to be the oldest city in Europe, used as a military defense location due to its elevated location. Locals are known as Asidonenses. The city's name comes from Medina (Arabic for city) and Sidonia (of Sidon), meaning "City of Sidon".
Medina-Sidonia was one of Spain's most important ducal seats in the 15th century; producing an admiral, Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, who led the Spanish Armada against England in 1588. The title of Duque de Medina Sidonia was bestowed upon the family of Guzmán El Bueno for his valiant role in taking the town. The line continues and was led until March 2008 by the controversial socialist, Luisa Isabel Álvarez de Toledo, 21st Duchess of Medina Sidonia (born  1936).

[[Luxury tax (sports)]]

CATEGORIES: Sports culture, Terminology used in multiple sports, Personnel economics

A luxury tax in professional sports is a surcharge put on the aggregate payroll of a team to the extent to which it exceeds a predetermined guideline level set by the league. The ostensible purpose of this "tax" is to prevent teams in major markets with high incomes from signing almost all of the more talented players and hence destroying the competitive balance necessary for a sport to maintain fan interest. The money derived from the "tax" is either divided among the teams that play in the smaller markets, presumably to allow them to have more revenue to devote toward the contracts of high-quality players,Dietl, H., Lang, M. and Werner, S. (2010): "The Effect of Luxury Taxes on Competitive Balance, Club Profits, and Social Welfare in Sports Leagues", forthcoming in International Journal of Sport Finance. or in the case of Major League Baseball, used by the league for other pre-defined purposes.
In North America, Major League Baseball has implemented the luxury tax system. The National Basketball Association also has a luxury tax provision; its utility is somewhat limited by the fact that the league also has a salary cap provision. The "hard" salary cap of the National Football League and the National Hockey League has prevented any need for a luxury tax arrangement.[tpl]cite book|last=Andreff|first=Wladimir |coauthors=Stefan Szymański|title=Handbook on the economics of sport|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84376-608-7|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=PGRkblShhU8C&pg=PA656&lpg=PA656&dq=sports+luxury+tax|pages=656[/tpl]

[[Eurobeat]]

CATEGORIES: Eurobeat, 1980s in music

Eurobeat is either a form of the British dance-pop variant of Italo disco or Hi-NRG-driven Italo disco music that both developed in the late 1980s.
In the United States, Eurobeat was sometimes marketed as Hi-NRG and for a short while shared this term with the very early freestyle music hits. Italo disco was often referred to as Eurobeat, probably due to the negative connotations of the word "disco" in the United States in the 1980s.
"Eurobeat" is also directly related to the Japanese Para Para dance culture, but in a completely different way, explained later in this article.

[[Setnakhte]]

CATEGORIES: Pharaohs of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt, 1186 BC deaths, Year of birth unknown

Userkhaure-setepenre Setnakhte (or Setnakht) was the first Pharaoh (1189 BC–1186 BC) of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt and the father of Ramesses III.
Setnakhte was not the son, brother or a direct descendant of the previous 2 pharaohs: either Twosret or Merneptah Siptah, nor that of Siptah's predecessor Seti II, whom Setnakht formally considered the last legitimate ruler.  It is possible that he was an usurper who seized the throne during a time of crisis and political unrest, or he could have been a member of a minor line of the Ramesside royal family who emerged as Pharaoh. He married Queen Tiy-merenese, perhaps a daughter of Merenptah. A connection between Setnakhte's successors and the preceding 19th dynasty is suggested by the fact that one of Ramesses II's children also bore this name and that similar names are shared by Setnakhte's descendants such as Ramesses, Amun-her-khepshef, Seth-her-khepshef and Monthu-her-khepshef.Nos ancêtres de l'Antiquité'' 1991.

[[Terra sigillata]]

CATEGORIES: History of ancient medicine, Medicinal clay, Ancient Roman pottery, Types of pottery decoration

Terra sigillata is a term with at least three distinct meanings:  as a description of medieval medicinal earth;  in archaeology, as a general term for some of the fine red Ancient Roman pottery with glossy surface slips made in specific areas of the Roman Empire; and more recently, as a description of a contemporary studio pottery technique supposedly inspired by ancient pottery.  Usually roughly translated as 'sealed earth', the meaning of 'terra sigillata' is 'clay bearing little images' (Latin sigilla), not 'clay with a sealed (impervious) surface'.  The archaeological term is applied, however, to plain-surfaced pots as well as those decorated with figures in relief.
Terra sigillata as an archaeological term refers chiefly to a specific type of plain and decorated tableware made in Italy and in Gaul (France and the Rhineland) during the Roman Empire.  These vessels have glossy surface slips ranging from a soft lustre to a brilliant glaze-like shine, in a characteristic colour range from pale orange to bright red; they were produced in standard shapes and sizes and were manufactured on an industrial scale and widely exported.  The sigillata industries grew up in areas where there were existing traditions of pottery manufacture, and where the clay deposits proved suitable. The products of the Italian workshops are also known as Arretine ware, and have been collected and admired since the Renaissance.  The wares made in the Gaulish factories are often referred to by English-speaking archaeologists as samian ware.  Closely related pottery fabrics made in the North African and Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire are not usually referred to as terra sigillata, but by more specific names, e.g. African Red Slip wares.  All these types of pottery are significant for archaeologists:  they can often be closely dated, and their distribution casts light on aspects of the ancient Roman economy.
Modern "Terra sig" should be clearly distinguished from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods.See, for example, http://archeologie.pagesperso-orange.fr/experimental/morla.htm  The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters can be made from most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, "terra sig" can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them.  The polished surface can only be retained if fired within the low-fire range and will lose its shine if fired higher, but can still display an appealing silky quality.

[[Indianapolis Racers]]
CATEGORIES: Indianapolis Racers, Ice hockey teams in Indiana

The Indianapolis Racers was a major league hockey team in the World Hockey Association from 1974 to 1978.  They competed in five seasons, folding 25 games into the 1978–79 season.  They played at Market Square Arena. They are often best known for being the first major league team to secure the services of Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier.  
The Racers were known in the WHA for their sometimes-fanatical fans. The franchise led the WHA in attendance for the 1976-1977 season. The Racers won the 1975-1976 WHA Eastern Division championship and swept the rival Cincinnati Stingers in the 1977 WHA playoffs. Notable players for the Racers included Pat Stapleton, Dave Keon, Michel Dion and Kim Clackson. The Racers' best-known coach Jacques Demers later led the Montreal Canadiens to win the NHL's Stanley Cup.
The NHL had stringent rules regarding the age of players they could sign while the WHA regularly signed underage players. Racers' owner Nelson Skalbania signed 17-year-old future super-star Wayne Gretzky to a personal contract worth between 1.125 and 1.75 million dollars over 4 to 7 years, which was at the time one of the largest contracts offered a hockey player.
Skalbania, a wealthy real estate businessman, regularly "flipped" real estate property and sports franchises for a profit. Many believed that Skalbania mismanaged the promising Indianapolis hockey market. Just eight games into the 1978-1979 season Skalbania liquidated his greatest asset to his old friend and former (and future) business partner, Peter Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers. Pocklington purchased Gretzky and two other Indianapolis players, goaltender Eddie Mio and forward Peter Driscoll, paying a reported $700,000 for the contracts of the three players, although the announced price was $850,000. The Racers folded 17 games later on December 15, 1978 and major league hockey has not returned.
The other six WHA teams finished the season, and before the Winnipeg Jets won the 1979 Avco World Trophy, the league accepted the terms of a merger with the NHL whereby Edmonton, Winnipeg, Quebec and New England would enter the NHL as "expansion teams" the following season, and the WHA itself would cease operations. Cincinnati and Birmingham, the other surviving WHA teams, were paid to disband.
Mark Messier also began his career with the Racers in the 1978–79 season, playing five games but failing to register a point before finishing his tryout contract.  He was picked up later by Cincinnati for the remainder of the season, before being selected by the Oilers in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft.  Messier retired in 2005 as the last active player to have played in the WHA, and thus the last active player to have played for the Racers.

Fournofarago ([tpl]lang-el| Φουρνοφάραγγο[/tpl]) is a small village located in southern Crete, Greece. Located in the municipal unit of Kofinas, it is about 7 miles (11 km) from Asimi, it has been in existence since at least 1842.
The first families arrived to the village from an old village named Katalimata. That old village is no longer standing, yet some ruins can be found in the mountain near Fournofarago.
The village is known for its celebratory feast of Aghios Georgios held annually on April 23 and a chapel fountain with reported healing powers. Many people journey to the fountain in order to return to their homes with the clear-tasting water. The chapel itself grants a good view of the whole region.
Nearby villages are Stavies, Vagionia and Loukia.
The village lies on the foothills of a mountain, which is home of various animals (hares and weasels, to name a few ) and also provides food for the various flocks of sheep, goats and cows owned by the villagers.

CATEGORIES: Soviet M-class submarines, Ships built in the Soviet Union, 1950s ships, Cold War submarines of the Soviet Union, Maritime incidents in 1956, Soviet submarine accidents, Lost submarines of the Soviet Union, 1956 in the Soviet Union

М-200 ''Месть (Myest'', meaning "vengeance" or "revenge") was a Malyutka class (Serie XV) short-range, diesel attack submarine of the Soviet Navy.
On 21 November 1956 while returning to port after transit to Paldiski near Tallinn, Myest was to rendezvous with the destroyer Статный (Statnyj, meaning "stately").  At about 19:45 hours, after spotting the destroyer, the boat's commanding officer, Captain Second Rank Yuri Pavlovich Shtikov, gave the conn to Captain Third Rank Shumanin, and went below for supper.  Shumanin had previous experience in Щ-type (щука, shchuka, "pike") and С-type (средняя, srednyaja, "medium") boats, but was new to М-type (малая, Malaya, "small") boats such as M-200.
At 19:53 hours, while attempting to take station alongside the destroyer, the submarine cut across the destroyer's bow, which struck the boat on the starboard side aft, flooding the two after compartments immediately and killing the six men stationed there. Eight men escaped in the six or eight minutes before the boat sank, but two of them drowned before they could be rescued.  Twenty-eight survivors were trapped in the compartments one, three, and four of the sunken submarine.
The submarine's emergency buoy was located at 21:05 hours, and communications were established with the remaining survivors in compartment one, the forward torpedo room.  The men in compartments three and four had already died.  Rescue forces began quickly arriving at the accident´s scene, but were unable to provide air to the survivors.
By 04:00 hours the next morning, 22 November, the men in the submarine were prepared to use their escape equipment to leave the wreck, but were ordered to remain aboard while the senior officers on the surface developed plans to lift the boat with a floating crane.  Numerous meetings occupied those officers until about 18:00 hours that evening, when the rescue attempt actually began. However, the weather had deteriorated, and when the rescue vessels began to drag anchor and the telephone cable to the sunken wreck parted, the attempt was abandoned.
At 03:47 hours the next morning, 23 November, divers located the wreck, and learned that the previous evening, after the telephone line parted and communications were lost, the survivors had decided to disobey orders, and escape on their own.  However, the first man to use the escape hatch had died in the attempt, blocking the hatch for the rest.  Killing them all, the submarine was never raised.

Digenea (Gr. Dis – double, Genos – race) is a subclass within the Platyhelminthes consisting of parasitic flatworms with a syncytial tegument and, usually, two suckers, one ventral and one oral. Adults are particularly common in the digestive tract, but occur throughout the organ systems of all classes of vertebrates. Once thought to be related to the Monogenea, it is now recognised that they are closest to the Aspidogastrea and that the Monogenea are more closely allied with the Cestoda. Around 6,000 species have been described to date.

Yushan ([tpl]zh|c=玉山|p=Yù Shān|l=Jade Mountain[/tpl]), also Mount Yu is the highest mountain in Taiwan and the fourth highest mountain on an island. In the past, Yushan was known among English-speaking expats and missionaries as Mount Morrison, thought to have been named in honor of the 19th century missionary Robert Morrison. Today, the mountain is referred to as Yushan or Jade Mountain.
In the winter, Yushan is often capped with thick snow which makes the entire peak shine like stainless jade, hence its name.  On July 21, 2009, Yushan was elected one of 28 finalists in the New7Wonders of Nature voting campaign. It even had held the top position in the “Mountains and Volcanoes” category on the list of first round voting of the 77 nominees ended on July 7, 2009.
Yushan and surrounding mountains belong to Yushan Range, which is part of Yushan National Park. The national park is Taiwan's largest, highest and least accessible national park. It contains the largest tract of wilderness remaining in Taiwan and is also valued for its pristine forests and faunal diversity, including many endemic species.
The highest point of Yushan Range, Yushan, is [tpl]convert|3952|m|ft|0[/tpl] above sea level, and is the highest point in the western Pacific region outside of the Kamchatka Peninsula.  Yushan was once in the ocean and raised to the current height because the Eurasian Plate slid under the neighboring Philippine Sea Plate.
The ocean waters off Taiwan's east coast are deep; in fact, submarine slopes plunge down to the Pacific Ocean at a grade of 1:10 and the ocean reaches a depth of more than [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|-2[/tpl] about [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|-1[/tpl] from the coast.Central Geological Survey, MOEA.

[[Dislocation]]
CATEGORIES: Crystallographic defects

In materials science, a dislocation is a crystallographic defect, or irregularity, within a crystal structure. The presence of dislocations strongly influences many of the properties of materials. The theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by Vito Volterra in 1907,Vito Volterra (1907) "Sur l'équilibre des corps élastiques multiplement connexes", ''Annales scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure, Vol. 24, pp. 401–517 but the term 'dislocation' to refer to a defect on the atomic scale was coined by G. I. Taylor in 1934.[ref]
[tpl]cite journal|author=G. I. Taylor|title=The Mechanism of Plastic Deformation of Crystals. Part I. Theoretical|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A|volume=145|issue=855|year=1934|pages=362–387|doi=10.1098/rspa.1934.0106|jstor=2935509[/tpl][/ref] Some types of dislocations can be visualized as being caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal. In such a case, the surrounding planes are not straight, but instead they bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. The analogy with a stack of paper is apt: if half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.
There are two primary types: edge dislocations and screw dislocations.  Mixed dislocations are intermediate between these.
Mathematically, dislocations are a type of topological defect, sometimes called a soliton. The mathematical theory explains why dislocations behave as stable particles: they can be moved around, but they maintain their identity as they move. Two dislocations of opposite orientation, when brought together, can cancel each other, but a single dislocation typically cannot "disappear" on its own.

CATEGORIES: 2003 debut albums, English-language albums, Fefe Dobson albums, Island Records albums

Fefe Dobson is the debut album of Canadian singer-songwriter Fefe Dobson. It was released on December 9, 2003.  The album was co-written by Dobson with producers Jay Levine and James Bryan McCollum. The album consists mainly of pop rock and punk music, and deals mainly with the topics of love and heartbreak. Several songs on the album are done in an acoustic style, while the remaining tracks feature prominent guitar and drum beats.
The album was released to generally positive reviews from critics, however its commercial performance was mixed. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart.Billboard Heatseekers Albums, Billboard, December 27, 2003. It debuted at number 111 on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually peaking at 67. Despite the minor success of the single, "Everything" in the UK, the album failed to chart there, as well as chart anywhere outside of the US and Canada.
The album did, however, spawn several successful singles. The first of these, titled "Bye Bye Boyfriend" was released during the final quarter of 2003 to generally positive critical and commercial performance. However, the single was only released in Canada. The second single, "Take Me Away", was her first single to be released internationally. The single became her second hit in Canada, as well as her only single to date that has charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. In 2004, Dobson released a new single, "Don't Go (Girls and Boys)", which was then appended to later pressings of the album. The song was also featured in a Tommy Hilfiger commercial starring Dobson.[tpl]cite press release|title=Music's newest stars featured in new fall 2004 Tommy Jeans ad campaign|publisher=Top40 Charts/Tommy Hilfiger|url= http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=8003&string=Fefe|date=2004-07-13[/tpl]
In March 2004, the album was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for sales of 100,000 copies. It has also sold over 300,000 copies in the US, giving it sales a roundabout 500,000 copies worldwide.

Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) was a major European integrated defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between BAE Systems and Finmeccanica until its dissolution on May 3, 2005.
AMS was formed in 1998 by the merger of GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems and Alenia Difesa. Equal shares in the resulting company were then held by Finmeccanica, and GEC-Marconi (later Marconi Electronic Systems (MES)), a division of The General Electric Company (GEC).
With the demerger and subsequent sale of its MES division in 1999, GEC's interest in AMS passed to BAE Systems.
In 2001 AMS' missile systems division was merged with Aerospatiale Matra Missiles and Matra BAe Dynamics to form MBDA.
On October 7, 2003 the UK holding company for AMS changed its registered name from Alenia Marconi Systems Limited to AMS Limited to comply with the agreements reached regarding use of the name “Marconi” following the sale of Marconi Electronic Systems by GEC (later Marconi plc). This name change was reflected in rebranding across the company, although the Italian holding company retained the name Alenia Marconi Systems SpA.
On January 28, 2005 BAE Systems and Finmeccanica announced the intention to dissolve their partnership in the AMS joint venture with AMS' UK and Italian operations taken over by the respective partners as arranged through the Eurosystems Transaction. On May 3, 2005, the Eurosystems Transaction was finalised:

[[Brinklow]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Warwickshire

Brinklow is a village and parish in the Rugby district of Warwickshire, England. It is about halfway between Rugby and Coventry, and has a population of 1,041 (2001 census).ONS Neighbourhood Statistics
Brinklow sits astride the former Roman Fosse Way and is most notable for the remains of a large Norman motte-and-bailey castle (Brinklow Castle, known locally as The Tump or the Big Hill), which is one of the largest and best preserved of its type in England. The castle is believed to be built on the site of an ancient burial mound or Roman signal station, although this has not been confirmed. Brinklow's name may have come from Old English Brincehláw = "burial mound on the brink of a hill" or alternatively perhaps "The Hill of Brynca", an Anglo-Saxon personal name.More likely though  the name Brinklow is a combination of the British/Welsh bryn,a hill and the Anglo Saxon hlaw also meaning hill.The name came about when the original Celtic speaking inhabitants were assimilated into Anglo Saxon culture. The meaning of the British word bryn was after some time forgotten causing the Anglo Saxonized inhabitants to add the word hlaw or low to signify a hill. Place names in England which combine both British and Anglo Saxon elements which  have the same meaning are quite common.  Penhill in Buckinghamshire and Mount Caburn, originally called Caer Bryn, in Lewes  East Sussex are both notable examples.
Brinklow is a picturesque village, and contains a 13th-century church, a primary school, and several shops and pubs. Brinklow was established as a market town during the Middle Ages, and was once considerably more important than it is today.
The Oxford Canal was constructed alongside the village in the 1790s and brought renewed trade and prosperity to the village. The village was once served by an arm of the canal, but this is now disused.  The village still has links with the canal however with a thriving boatyard/Narrowboat holiday hire company located there on the Oxford canal.  The boatyard was started in 1960 at the site of the old lengthmans cottage.  The manager was Charles Haslam and he worked for the Maid Line Cruiser company from Thames Ditton, London.  The house was renovated by a local building in 1960 but was never more than a very drafty pile with a very damp basement.  The old outbuildings were renovated and turned into a small workshop and a waterfront office.  The waterfront office was the gathering place for boat owners on a Sunday evening to sit and enjoy the summer air while sharing stories and the odd pint of beer from the railway Inn.  I believe it was in 1962 that the slipway was dug and the large boatshed was built on the far side of the canal.  The boatyard became a thriving source of income for the local village as boat renters purchased their supplies from the local grocery shop, and various gifts and so forth from the small selection of shops the village had to offer during the 1960s

[[Political religion]]
CATEGORIES: Religion and politics, Ideologies, Secular religion

The theory of political religion concerns governmental ideologies whose cultural and political backing is so strong that they are said to attain power equivalent to those of a state religion, to which they often exhibit significant similarities in both theory and practice.Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press In addition to basic forms of politics, like parliament and elections, it also holds an aspect of sacralization related to the institutions held within the regime and provides also the inner measures traditionally considered to be a religious territory, such as Ethics, Values, Symbols, Myths, Rituals and for example a national Liturgical calendar. Political religious organizations, such as the Nazi Party, held strong to the idealization of cultural and political power over the country at large. The church body of the state no longer held control over the practices of religious identity. For example, Nazism is situated into this base meaning, and therefore was countered by many political and religious organizations as being a political religion, based on the dominate encasing which the Nazi regime had over the religion and population (Gates and Steane)"Political Religion -the influence of Ideological and Identity Orientation" (2009). Political religions generally vie with existing traditional religions, and may try to replace or eradicate them.  The term was given new attention by the political scientist Hans Maier.[tpl]cite book |editor1-last=Maier |editor1-first=Hans |date=2004–2012 |origyear=1996-2003 |title=Totalitarismus und politische Religionen |trans_title=Totalitarianism and political religions (3 vols.) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wozo1W7giZQC&dq |location= |publisher=Routledge |isbn= |accessdate= |page=108[/tpl]
Totalitarian societies are perhaps more prone to political religion, but various scholars have described features of political religion even in democracies, for instance American civil religion as described by Robert Bellah in 1967.
The term is sometimes treated as synonymous with civil religion, [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] but although some scholars use the terms as equivalent, others see a useful distinction, using "civil religion" as something weaker, which functions more as a socially unifying and essentially conservative force, where a political religion is radically transformational, even apocalyptic.Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, s.xxii
The term is sometimes used outside academia, often with meanings tangential to or opposite to the sociological usage (for example, applying it to a church), with the use intended as a derogatory description of excessive adherence to something political or ideological. Even when used correctly, supporters of an ideology will generally reject the application of the term "political religion".[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2010[/tpl]

The Lipizzan or Lipizzaner ([tpl]lang-hu|Lipicai[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sl|Lipicanec[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|Lipizzano[/tpl], [tpl]lang-hr|Lipicanac[/tpl], [tpl]lang-cz|Lipicán[/tpl]), is a breed of horse closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, where they demonstrate the haute école or "high school" movements of classical dressage, including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the "airs above the ground." The horses at the Spanish Riding School are trained using traditional methods based on classical dressage that date back hundreds of years.
The Lipizzan breed dates back to the 16th century, when it was developed with the support of the Habsburg nobility. The breed takes its name from one of the earliest stud farms established, located near the Karst Plateau village of Lipica (spelled "Lipizza" in Italian), in modern-day Slovenia. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the War of the First Coalition, World War I and World War II. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. Along with the Disney movie, Lipizzans have also starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books and other media.
Today, eight stallions are recognized as the foundation bloodstock of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.

Hume Lake is an artificial lake in the Sequoia National Forest of Fresno County, California, adjacent to the unincorporated community of Hume. It is on Tenmile Creek, which flows into the Kings River.  The surface elevation of the lake is [tpl]convert|1585|m|abbr=on[/tpl].  It is accessible from California Route 180, via Forest Service road 30, and is about [tpl]convert|50|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] east of Fresno, not far from the west entrance to Kings Canyon National Park.
The [tpl]convert|87|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] lake lies behind the world's first concrete reinforced multiple arch dam, designed by John S. Eastwood and constructed in 1908 by the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company.  During lumber operations, the lake stored logs for an adjacent mill and supplied water for a flume used to transport the cut lumber to Sanger, California.
Since the cessation of logging in 1924, Hume Lake's identity has shifted from being an industrial implement to a recreational resource.

[[Vietnam Campaign Medal]]
CATEGORIES: Military awards and decorations of Vietnam, Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War

The Republic of Vietnam Vietnam Campaign Medal is a military campaign medal of the former country of South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam).  Established in 1966, it was awarded to members of United States, Australian, and New Zealand military forces serving six months or more in support of Republic of Vietnam military operations. The medal was the most commonly bestowed foreign military award to United States Armed Forces personnel prior to the Gulf War.578.129 2 Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal
The Vietnam Campaign Medal may also be awarded to any service member who, while serving outside the geographical limits of the Republic of Vietnam, provided direct combat support to the Republic of Vietnam armed forces for a period exceeding six months. This stipulation most often applies to members who performed Vietnam War support from Thailand and Japan. In such cases, a U.S. service member must have been awarded either the Vietnam Service Medal or the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (for service in a Vietnam campaign) to be eligible for the Vietnam Campaign Medal. For those members who were wounded by an enemy force, captured by the enemy in the line of duty, or killed in action, the Vietnam Campaign Medal is automatically awarded regardless of total time served in Vietnam.578.129  3 i, ii, iii Republic of Vietnam Campaign MedalAir Force Personnel Center Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal
The medal is issued with a device known as the 1960 Bar. The bar displays the date of 1960 followed by a dash and a blank space. The unusual appearance was caused by the government of the Republic of Vietnam stating that the 1960 bar would show the dates of the Vietnam War from start to finish, with the ending date placed on the 1960 bar after the South Vietnamese had triumphed over North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam). Since South Vietnam fell, and the government ceased to exist, an ending date for the 1960 Bar was never established.
In addition to the 1960 Bar, Republic of Vietnam armed forces memorandum 2655 prescribed a second device for service during the period 8 March 1949 to 20 July 1954 (which had both years displayed). American military personnel have never been authorized to wear it, but since this was during the French colonial period it is unlikely that many would have been eligible.
The Vietnam Campaign Medal is considered a foreign award by the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand governments. The U.S. equivalent award is known as the Vietnam Service Medal (campaign medal). The joint Australian and New Zealand campaign medal awarded for service in the Vietnam War is the Vietnam Medal.
Other frequently bestowed Vietnam awards include the Vietnam Gallantry Cross and the Vietnam Civil Actions Medal, both of which were awarded extensively to both Vietnamese military service members and to the members of foreign militaries.

William Kashtan (1909 – 1993) was general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada for 23 years beginning in January 1965, several months following the death of Leslie Morris, until his retirement in 1988. The delay in his assuming the position was due to the opposition of Tim Buck to his appointment.
Kashtan was born in Montréal in 1909. In 1927, at the age of 18, he joined the Young Communist League. Two years later, he moved to southern Ontario to organize for the YCL there and then became the League's general secretary in 1930. In 1936, he helped found the Canadian Youth Congress which, at its peak, had over 400,000 members.Archives Canada biography
He visited Spain early in the Spanish Civil War and on his return helped organize the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion. 
After World War II he served as Toronto organizer of the Labor-Progressive Party, as the Communist Party was known from 1943 to 1959, and served subsequently as industrial director, labour secretary and central organizer.  
He was a perennial candidate for the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party was known from 1943 to 1959) and then the Communist Party of Canada and became general secretary of the party in 1965, despite the opposition of party chairman and longtime leader Tim Buck.
Kashtan never succeeded in winning election to the Canadian House of Commons, and retired in 1988. He was an orthodox, pro-Moscow Communist and consistently supported the Soviet Union through various shifts in policy at the Kremlin. Kashtan opposed Eurocommunism in the 1970s when many other Communist Parties in the west embraced it. 
In 1970, Kashtan spoke out against the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) group in Quebec, describing it as a terrorist organization and claiming that its methods were not consistent with genuine revolutionary behaviour.
In 1971, he asked James Gareth Endicott to resign as president of the Canadian Peace Congress accusing him of having anti-Soviet and pro-China views. 
Kashtan retired as party leader in 1988 and was replaced by George Hewison. In the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Hewison and his supporters attempted to move the Communist Party away from Marxism-Leninism and towards social democracy in light of the failure of Soviet-style Communism. Kashtan came out of retirement to fight the changes.

McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship. He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City, who were in the Premier League at the time. Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season, McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009. Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final, but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season.
Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals, Aston Villa. This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa, and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs. Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011–12 Premier League season, his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season. McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012, but left after 40 days by mutual consent.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21338533|title=Alex McLeish: Nottingham Forest manager exits City Ground|publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013[/tpl]
In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport, in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/07/03/alex-mcleish-honoured-by-university-of-aberdeen-97319-21220729/ |title=Alex McLeish honoured by University of Aberdeen |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2008[/tpl]

[[Windbreak]]
CATEGORIES: Forestry and the environment, Environmental soil science, Garden features, Geotechnical engineering, Habitat management equipment and methods, Sustainable agriculture, Agroforestry

A windbreak or shelterbelt is a plantation usually made up of one or more rows of trees or shrubs planted in such a manner as to provide shelter from the wind and to protect soil from erosion. They are commonly planted around the edges of fields on farms. If designed properly, windbreaks around a home can reduce the cost of heating and cooling and save energy. Windbreaks are also planted to help keep snow from drifting onto roadways and even yards. Other benefits include providing habitat for wildlife and in some regions the trees are harvested for wood products.
Windbreaks and intercropping can be combined in a farming practice referred to as alleycropping. Fields are planted in rows of different crops surrounded by rows of trees. These trees provide fruit, wood, or protect the crops from the wind. Alley cropping has been particularly successful in India, Africa, and Brazil, where coffee growers have combined farming and forestry.Withgott & Brennan 2008, p.249
A further use for a shelterbelt is to screen a farm from a main road or motorway. This improves the farm landscape by reducing the visual incursion of the motorway, mitigating noise from the traffic and providing a safe barrier between farm animals and the road.
The term "windbreak" is also used to describe an article of clothing worn to prevent wind chill. Americans tend to use the term "windbreaker" whereas Europeans favor the term "windbreak".
Fences called "windbreaks" are also used. Normally made from cotton, nylon, canvas, and recycled sails, windbreaks tend to have three or more panels held in place with poles that slide into pockets sewn into the panel.  The poles are then hammered into the ground and a windbreak is formed. Windbreaks or "wind fences" are used to reduce wind speeds over erodible areas such as open fields, industrial stockpiles, and dusty industrial operations. As erosion is proportional to wind speed cubed a reduction of wind speed of 1/2 (for example) will reduce erosion by over 80%.

[[M72 LAW]]
CATEGORIES: Anti-tank rockets of the United States

The M72 LAW (Light Anti-Tank Weapon, also referred to as the Light Anti-Armor Weapon or LAW as well as LAWS Light Anti-Armor Weapons System) is a portable one-shot 66 mm unguided anti-tank weapon. The solid rocket propulsion unit was developed in the newly formed Rohm and Haas research laboratory at Redstone Arsenal in 1959,E. T. DeRieux et al "Final Report – Development of LAW Propulsion Unit," R&H RARD, Technical Report No. S-12, December 1959 then the full system was designed by Paul V. Choate, Charles B. Weeks, Frank A. Spinale, et al. at the Hesse-Eastern Division of Norris Thermadore. American production of the weapon began by Hesse-Eastern in 1963, and was terminated by 1983; currently it is produced by Nammo Raufoss AS in Norway.
In early 1963, the M72 LAW was adopted by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps as their primary individual infantry anti-tank weapon, replacing the M31 HEAT rifle grenade and the M20A1 "Super Bazooka" in the U.S. Army. It was subsequently adopted by the U.S. Air Force to serve in an anti-emplacement/anti-armor role in Air Base Defense duties.Mary T. Cagle "History of the TOW Missile System" page 10, U.S. Army 1977 Redstone Arsenal Pdf file of official TOW history that discussed the new family of antitank weapons, the M72 LAW, the Dragon and the TOWThe U.S. Army partially replaced the Super Bazooka not only with the M72 LAW, but also M67 recoilless rifle and U.S. Marines kept the Super Bazooka in service till the late 1960s
It had been intended that, in the early 1980s, the M72 would be replaced by the FGR-17 Viper; but this program was canceled by Congress and the M136 AT4 was introduced in its place. In that time period, its nearest comparison was the Swedish Pskott m/68 (Miniman) and the French SARPAC.SARPAC was never adopted by the French Army – export only

Chagatai Khan (Urdu;Persian: [tpl]Nastaliq| چغتائی خان [/tpl]; [tpl]lang-mn|Цагадай[/tpl], Tsagadai; b. 1183– d.1241 or 1242) was the second son of Genghis Khan. He was Khan of the Chagatai Khanate from 1226-1242 C.E.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=1pkeWqq7pdgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi|author=Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, N.

He inherited most of what are now the five Central Asian states after the death of his father. He was also appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the execution of the Yassa, the written code of law created by Genghis Khan, though that lasted only until Genghis Khan was crowned Khan of the Mongol Empire. The Empire later came to be known as the Chagatai Khanate, a descendant empire of the Mongol Empire. Chagatai Khan was considered hot-headed and somewhat temperamental by his relatives, because of his attitude of non-acceptance of Jochi as Great Khan. He was the most vocal about this issue among his relations. Chaghatai himself appears to have been a just and energetic governor, though perhaps rough and uncouth, and addicted to hard drinking. At any rate, he was animated by the soldier-like spirit of his father, and succeeded in keeping order among as heterogeneous a population, as a kingdom was ever composed of.

Soviet submarine ''B-37 ([tpl]lang-ru|Б-37''[/tpl]) was a Project 641 or Foxtrot-class diesel submarine of the Soviet Navy's Northern Fleet.
On 11 January 1962, the submarine was tied up at the pier in Ekaterininsky bay of Polarny naval base, with all watertight doors open, while conducting maintenance and testing of her torpedoes. A fire broke out in the torpedo compartment, probably due to hydrogen gas igniting when electrical equipment was energized.  All eleven torpedoes cooked off.  The submarine was instantly destroyed with all hands except the commanding officer Captain Second Rank Begeba who was on the pier at the time of explosion, and Captain Third Rank Jakubenko, who was on another part of the sub base.
[tpl]ship|Soviet submarine|S-350||2|up=on[/tpl], a Project 633 or Romeo-class submarine tied up next to B-37, was badly damaged by the explosion as well, and several men from other ships and the shipyard were killed.

Anthony Alexander Jarrett (born 13 August 1968 in Enfield, London) is a former sprint and hurdling athlete from England. He was a silver medalist in the 110 metres hurdles at the World Championships in 1993 and 1995, and at the European Championships in 1990, and won the gold medal in the event at the Commonwealth Games in 1998. 
Jarrett came 4th in the 110m hurdles at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, missing out on a bronze medal by 1000th of a second to Jack Pierce of the USA. He again narrowly missed out on an Olympic medal when he was a member of the 4 x 100m sprint relay team that also finished 4th in the Olympic final of that year. Four years earlier in 1988 he finished in 6th place in the 110m hurdles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
Jarrett's career was overshadowed by the achievements of fellow Briton Colin Jackson, who beat him into second place on numerous occasions at major competitions such as the World Championships, Commonwealth Games (twice), European Championships and Goodwill Games. Jackson also defeated Jarrett eight times at the national championships. In all Jarrett won two individual world silver medals and one individual bronze medal in the 110m hurdles, and another silver and bronze medal in the 4 x 100m sprint relay.
Jarrett was disqualified for false starts at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the first round, and in the semi-finals of the 2001 World Championships, events from which he appeared never to recover. 
Jarrett's personal best time for the 110m hurdles is 13.00 seconds, set when he finished as runner-up to Jackson at the 1993 World Championships.

Apache Lenya is a Java/XML open-source content management system based on the Apache Cocoon content management framework.  Features include revision control, scheduling, search capabilities, workflow support, and browser-based WYSIWYG editors.
Lenya was originally started by Michael Wechner in early 1999 to manage the content of the journal of pattern formation. Michael previously did basic research in physics by writing computer simulations on dendritic growth.
In early 2000 Michael co-founded Wyona, which continued to develop Lenya on the basis of the interactive newspaper edition of Neue Zürcher Zeitung. The name Lenya is a combination of the names of his two sons Levi and Vanya.
In the spring of 2003, Wyona donated Lenya to the Apache Software Foundation, where Lenya was incubated and became a Top Level Project in September 2004.
In 2006 Michael has started a new CMS called Yanel (an anagram of Lenya) featuring versioned interfaces as an approach to provide backwards compatibility at all times and hence replacing the classical approach of periodical releases by continuous deployment.

Its length is approximately [tpl]convert|100|km[/tpl] and its width in its narrowest part is approximately [tpl]convert|600|m|mi[/tpl]. The strait is covered with ice for the most of the year. There are fishing settlements along the strait (Matochkin Shar, Stolbovoy).
It is also the site where, from 1963 to 1990, about 39 underground nuclear tests took place in a vast array of tunnels and shafts. After 2000, Russia started to reactivate the test site by enlarging old tunnels and starting construction work. Each summer since then various subcritical hydronuclear experiments have taken place. In 2004, Rosatom reportedly performed a series of subcritical hydronuclear experiments with up to [tpl]convert|100|g|oz[/tpl] of weapon-grade plutonium each.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/weafacl/othernuc/novayaze.htm |title=Russia: Central Test Site, Novaya Zemlya |date=2003-07-30 |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |accessdate = 2006-10-14[/tpl]

Ethos ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s[/tpl]) is a Greek word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence its hearer's emotions, behaviours, and even morals.Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1 Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs.

The Commonwealth Liberal Party (CLP, also known as the Deakin–Cook Party, The Fusion, or the Deakinite Liberal Party) was a political movement active in Australia from 1909 to 1917, shortly after Federation.  It was the earliest direct ancestor of the current Liberal Party of Australia.
The party was formed in response to the Australian Labor Party forming its second government, in 1908.  The establishment[tpl]who|date=July 2013[/tpl] put considerable pressure on Alfred Deakin, the leader of the Protectionist Party, and Joseph Cook, leader of the Anti-Socialist Party, to join forces in order to counter Labor's growing popularity.  In 1909, the Protectionists and Anti-Socialists, at a meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House, agreed to merge, forming the CLP, based on a shared platform of opposing Labor.  Deakin was the new party's first leader, with Cook as deputy leader.  The merger didn't sit well with several of the more liberal Protectionists, who defected to Labor.
Between them, the Protectionists and Anti-Socialists held a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.  As a result, the newly merged party used its numbers to force Prime Minister Andrew Fisher to resign with Deakin again taking office. However, the CLP was defeated by Labor at its first election, held less than a year later in 1910.
Cook took over the leadership from Deakin shortly before the 1913 election and won government by a single seat.  However, only a year later, Cook deliberately introduced a bill abolishing preferential treatment for public-service union members.  Cook knew the Labor-controlled Senate would vote it down, giving him an excuse to call a double dissolution election.  When the Senate rejected it twice, Cook called an election for 5 September, the first double dissolution election since Federation. The CLP was soundly defeated, and Labor won control of both chambers.
The CLP remained in opposition until November 1916, when it reached a confidence and supply agreement with Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who had recently been expelled from the ALP for supporting conscription in World War I and organised his followers as the National Labor Party.  In February 1917, the CLP and National Labor formally merged to form the Nationalist Party of Australia.  Although the merged party was dominated by former Liberals, Hughes became its leader with Cook as his deputy.
The Commonwealth Liberal Party is often referred to by the retronym "Deakinite Liberal Party" in order to distinguish it from the later Liberal Party of Australia, which was officially founded in 1945.

Yellow socialism has two meanings. It was an economic system proposed in 1902 by Pierre Biétry, as an alternative to the "Red socialism" advocated in Marxism.Payne, Stanley. A History of Fascism, 1914-1945. Routledge, 1996. pp. 46. Yellow socialism was prominent until World War I, competing with Marxism for support among workers. "Yellow socialism" was also a Marxist term of abuse for all non-Marxist socialists.
After the war, the movement became absorbed into fascism, and the previously developed Austrian national socialism which from 1920 developed into Nazism.

[[V-Disc]]

CATEGORIES: American record labels, Record labels established in 1941, Record labels disestablished in 1949, Jazz record labels, American Forces Network

V-Disc ("V" for Victory) was a morale-boosting initiative involving the production of several series of recordings during the World War II era by special arrangement between the United States government and various private U.S. record companies. The records were produced for the use of United States military personnel overseas. Many popular singers, big bands and orchestras of the era recorded special V-Disc records. These 12-inch, vinyl 78 rpm gramophone recordings were created for the Army between October 1943 and May 1949. Navy discs were released between July 1944 and September 1945. Twelve-inch discs were used because, when 136 grooves per inch were used, they could hold up to six and a half minutes of music.
Army V-discs were issued in series A-Z, AA-ZZ and AAA-FFF. Navy V-discs were issued in series A-N. 
The V-Disc project actually began in June 1941, six months before the United States' involvement in World War II, when Captain Howard Bronson was assigned to the Army's Recreation and Welfare Section as a musical advisor.  Bronson suggested the troops might appreciate a series of records featuring military band music, inspirational records that could motivate soldiers and improve morale.  By 1942, the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) sent 16-inch, 33 rpm vinyl transcription discs to the troops from eight sources: special recording sessions, concerts, recitals, radio broadcasts, film sound tracks and commercial records.
Meanwhile, the American Federation of Musicians, under the leadership of James Caesar Petrillo, were involved in a major recording strike against the four major record companies. This continued until the intervention of recording pioneer George Robert Vincent, who was at that point a lieutenant. On October 27, 1943, Vincent convinced Petrillo to allow his union musicians to record sides for the military, as long as the records were not offered for purchase in the United States.  From that moment on, artists who wanted to record now had an outlet for their productivity — as well as a guaranteed, receptive, enthusiastic worldwide audience of soldiers, sailors and airmen.
The V-Discs were an instant hit overseas.  Soldiers who were tired of hearing the same old recordings were treated to new and special releases from the top bands of the day.  And such a varied selection - big band hits, some swing music, classical performances from the top symphonies, a little jazz here and there, even some marching music to keep Major Bronson happy.  Radio networks sent airchecks and live feeds to V-Disc headquarters in New York.  Some movie studios sent rehearsal feeds from the latest Hollywood motion pictures to V-Disc.  Artists gathered at several V-Disc recording sessions in theaters around New York and Los Angeles, including CBS Playhouse No. 3 (currently the Ed Sullivan Theater), NBC Studio 8H (the current home of Saturday Night Live), and CBS Playhouse No. 4 (reborn in the 1970s as Studio 54). V-Discs were pressed by major civilian record companies like RCA Victor and Columbia Records.
Many V-Discs contained spoken-word introductions by bandleaders and artists, wishing good luck and prayers for the soldiers overseas, and their hopes for a swift and safe return. Glenn Miller, for instance, introduced V-Disc 65A, issued in December, 1943, with the following message: "This is Captain Glenn Miller speaking for the Army Air Force's Training Command Orchestra and we hope that you soldiers of the Allied forces enjoy these V-Discs that we're making just for you." V-Discs also featured one-of-a-kind performances, as artists who were not shackled by restrictive record company contracts could now perform special versions of the 1940s' most popular hits.  
The "V" stands for "Victory" although Lieutenant Vincent was quoted later to say that the "V" stood for "Vincent". 
After the V-Disc program ended in 1949, the Armed Services set out to honor the original AFM request that the records not be used for commercial purposes.  Original masters and stampers were destroyed.  Leftover V-Discs at bases and on ships were discarded.  On some occasions, the FBI and the Provost Marshal's Office confiscated and destroyed V-Discs that servicemen had smuggled home.  An employee at a Los Angeles record company even did some jail time — his crime was the illegal possession of over 2500 V-Discs.V-Disc Records (1943-1949) Victory Music
Nevertheless, the Library of Congress has a complete set of V-Discs, and the National Archives did save some of the metal stampers.  Today, several compilations of V-Disc records are now commercially available on compact disc collections. V-Discs are readily available although discs from later series are scarcer than those from earlier series. 
Today, V-Discs are very collectible, with some titles by Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra or Billie Holiday garnering $50–$75 apiece (and it's no longer illegal to buy and sell remaining V-Discs). 
During the United States occupation of Japan, the V-Disc collection in the Service Club at the NYK (Nihon Yusen-Kaisha) office building-barracks had several discs by various artists that carried the subtitle "Fluffs at a Record Session." All of these contained tunes in full by the regular, famous American V-Disc artists. The fluffs records were unusual in that each contained some egregious error—usually in the lyrics—by the performer. Most of those were humorous and seemed to be intentional as is not unusual in recording sessions. The soldiers used to seek out the fluffs and play those first.

[[Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy]]
CATEGORIES: Professorships at the University of Cambridge, 1782 establishments in England, Professorships in physics

The Jacksonian Professorship of Natural Philosophy is one of the senior chairs in Natural and Experimental philosophy at Cambridge University, and was founded in 1782 by a bequest from the Reverend Richard Jackson.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Jackson, Richard (1700-1782?)|volume=29[/tpl]
In 1782 the Reverend Richard Jackson of Tarrington, Herefordshire, and a former fellow of Trinity College died, leaving a fifth of the income from his estate to the head gardener of the university's physic garden and the remainder to found the Professorship of Natural and Experimental Philosophy that now bears his name. His will specified the details of the professor with much precision, including that preference should be given to candidates from Trinity and men from Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Cheshire, and that any holder must search for a cure for gout! 
The will also stated that his lectures should promote "real and useful knowledge" by "showing or doing something in the way of experiment upon the subject undertaken to be treated," and its early holders consequently tended towards the experimental end of the field, such as chemists and engineers. More recently, it has been decided that the professorship should permanently be associated with physics.
The first holder of the position was the mathematician and chemist Isaac Milner, elected to the post in 1783.
One result of the bequest was that a building was erected to allow public lectures for the professor, as well as the professor of botany. It was the University's first building to be specifically designed for the teaching of science.

Gregory ("Greg") Foster (born August 4, 1958) was an American hurdling athlete. He was born in Chicago, Illinois. He is the only person in the history of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics to win three consecutive 110 meter hurdling titles (1983, 1987, and 1991).  He was the 1981 IAAF World Cup and the 1991 World Indoor hurdling champion. 
As well as his international titles, Foster was twice NCAA outdoor champion (1978 and 1980) in the 110 meter hurdles and was the NCAA 200 meter dash champion in 1979.  He won 10 U.S. national titles, four of them outdoors in the 110 meter hurdles (1981, 1983, 1986, and 1987) and six indoors, in the 60 yard hurdles (1983, 1984, 1985), 55 meter hurdles (1987, 1988) and 60 meter hurdles (1991).
He broke the indoor world record for the 50 meter hurdles in 1985 (6.35 seconds) and tied that mark in 1987.  He also broke the 60 meter hurdle indoor world record in 1987 with a time of 7.36.  He was the American Record Holder in the 110 meter hurdles at 13.22 seconds while competing for UCLA, second at the time only to Cuba's world record holder Alejandro Casañas.

[[Mottershead]]
CATEGORIES: Surnames

Mottershead is an English habitation name which has its common root in the township of Mottram St. Andrew in Cheshire, England where it was first recorded in the 13th century as Mottresheved, from the gen. case of the OE byname Mōtere 'Speaker' + ME heved head(land), hill. The motto of the family is the Latin "Pro Amore Patriae" ("For the love of the homelands")
It was to this region that descendants of a Norman knight "Mottresheved" (or maybe the knight himself) came after the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066 and there are references to the name in the Domesday Book.
The possibility does exist that the knight's Domesday listing was a corruption of the location name already in existence. The name also may denote a building where village assemblies were held.
Typical features of the Mottersheads, such as their size (not overly tall) and colouring (especially dark brown hair - not many blondes) suggests a strong Welsh influence.

Demons ([tpl]lang-ru|Бесы[/tpl], Bésy) is an 1872 anti-nihilistic novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Although titled The Possessed in the initial English translation, Dostoyevsky scholars and later translations favour the titles The Devils or Demons.
An extremely political book, Demons is a testimonial of life in Imperial Russia in the late 19th century.
As the revolutionary democrats begin to rise in Russia, different ideologies begin to collide. Dostoyevsky casts a critical eye on both the radical idealists, portraying their ideas and ideological foundation as demonic,The introduction of Demons Trans. Pevear and Volokhonsky. New York: Vintage Classics, 1995 and the conservative establishment's ineptitude in dealing with those ideas and their social consequences.
This form of intellectual conservativism tied to the Slavophile movement of Dostoyevsky's day, called Pochvennichestvo, is seen to have continued on into its modern manifestation in individuals like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.An Intellectual Tradition: Dostoyevsky and Alex Solzhenitsyn In an elaborately researched monograph, Russian scholar and political philosopher, Nicholas Rzhevsky, unequivocally confirms that Dostoyevsky created a unique religious synthesis and conservative intellectual tradition in late nineteenth-century Russian history (Cf. his Russian Literature and Ideology: Herzen, Dostoyevsky, Leontiev, Tolstoy, Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1983, pp. l3-14; 22; 65–95; 149–154) Dostoyevsky's novels focus on the idea that utopias and positivist ideas, in being utilitarian, were unrealistic and unobtainable.[ref]Diagnosing Literary Genius: A Cultural History of Psychiatry in Russia, 1880–1930 By Irina Sirotkina

The book has five primary characters representing different ideologies. By exploring their differing philosophies, Dostoyevsky describes the political chaos seen in 19th century Russia.

John Stanley Plaskett FRS[tpl]cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1942.0007[/tpl] (November 17, 1865 – October 17, 1941) was a Canadian astronomer.
He worked as a machinist, and was offered a job as a mechanician at the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, constructing apparatus and assisting with demonstrations during lectures.  He found this so interesting that at the age of 30 he enrolled as an undergraduate in mathematics and physics.  He stayed at the university until 1903, doing research on color photography.
His formal astronomical career did not start until 1903, when he was appointed to the staff at Dominion Observatory in Ottawa. He measured radial velocities and studied spectroscopic binaries, and performed the first detailed analysis of galactic structure."Died this day", The Globe and Mail, October 16, 2004; page F-10 His mechanical background was very useful for constructing various instruments. He became first director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia in 1917 (not to be confused with the old Dominion Observatory in Ottawa).
His son, Harry Hemley Plaskett, also pursued a very successful career in astronomy, winning the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1963, thereby making the Plasketts one of the very few families to boast more than one Medal winner.

Prince Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky ([tpl]lang-ru|Ива́н Андре́евич Хова́нский[/tpl]) was a Russian boyar who led the Streltsy during the Moscow Uprising of 1682, alternatively known as the Khovanshchina. His life was dramatized by Modest Mussorgsky in the eponymous opera. Khovansky's moniker, Tararui, derives from the old Russian word for "chatterbox".
Khovansky came from a senior Gediminid family, whose ancestors moved from Podolia to Moscow in 1408. He started his employment under Mikhail I as a stolnik. In 1650 he was sent to Tula to counter the raids of Crimean Tatars. In 1651–1654 he was governor in Vyazma, and in 1656 he was governor of Mogilev.
During the Russian-Polish-Swedish war he served as a voivod. In 1657 he blitzed a number of Swedes under Gdov. He was promoted to boyars on March 27, 1659. In January 1660 he attacked Brest and set it on fire. During the Copper Riot in Moscow on 25 July 1662 he dealt with insurgents and then led an investigation committee based in Kolomenskoe. In 1663 he was proclaimed a judge of the Yamskoi Prikaz. Between 1669–1678 he governed Pskov, Smolensk, and Novgorod. He was reputed as a dour and masterful manager who did not look kindly on local licentiousness and manners.
Upon Feodor III's death in April 1682, taking advantage of his popularity among the Streltsy, Khovansky helped to dismiss the Miloslavsky family from power. He engineered the great Streltsy uprising (May 15 to May 17, 1682), during which their old and unpopular leader, Prince Mikhail Dolgorukov, was murdered and Khovansky named his successor. Thus, he became de facto Minister of War of Muscovite Russia. Wishing to secure the allegiance of the Streltsy, he announced total forgiveness to those who took part in the uprising. 
Through the support of the Streltsy he established a dual-reign regime, the joint rule of Ivan V and Peter I, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna. As he supported the Old Believers he organized in 1682 a schismatic demonstration and forced Patriarch Joachim to agree to a public debate with one of the Old Believer leaders, Nikita Pustosvyat. The patriarch refuted Pustosvyat's arguments and the next day Sophia had Pustosvyat executed. 
Relying on the Streltsy, Khovansky wielded enormous political influence and often interfered in the government affairs. In June 1682 he was appointed to lead the Prikaz of Judges. His uncommon arrogance and vanity alienated Sophia and her Miloslavsky relatives, while inducing jealousy on the part of other boyars. 
Eventually, the rumours about Khovansky's intention to assassinate the Tsar's family and to usurp the throne prompted Sophia to evacuate Ivan V and Peter I from Moscow to Kolomenskoe and then to the St Savva monastery in Zvenigorod. In September a royal ukase declared Khovansky the mutineer and the patron of heretics, while the Boyar Duma had him sentenced to death.  He was captured in Pushkino near Moscow and taken to Vozdvizhenskoe where he was beheaded together with his son.
When the news of Khovansky's execution reached the Streltsy stationed in Moscow, they started a riot and seized the Kremlin, but the regent soon quelled the mutinous army and appointed Fyodor Shaklovity as their new leader.

[[Sky City 1000]]

CATEGORIES: Proposed skyscrapers in Japan, Buildings and structures in Tokyo

Sky City 1000 is a visionary but not real project.  It is a supertall skyscraper in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan announced in 1989 during the height of the Japanese asset price bubble.
The plan consists of a building [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|0[/tpl] tall and [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide at the base, and a total floor area of [tpl]convert|8|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on[/tpl].Sky City 1000 - Emporis The design, proposed in 1989 by Takenaka Corporation, would house between 35,000Discovery Channel :: Extreme Engineering: Sky City and 36,000SKY CITY 1000 full-time residents, as well as 100,000 workers. It comprises 14 concave dish-shaped "Space Plateaus" stacked one upon the other. The interior of the plateaus would contain greenspace, and on the edges, on the sides of the building, would be the apartments. Also included in the building would be offices, commercial facilities, schools, theatres, and other modern amenities.
Since its announcement, it has garnered a lot of attention from the world's architectural establishment,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] and was featured on Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering in 2003. 
Land prices in Japan were the highest in the world at the time, and Kisho Kurokawa, one of Japan's most famous architects, has said that staggeringly ambitious buildings employing highly sophisticated engineering are still cheap, because companies pay 90% of the cost for the land and only 10% for the building.Cities in the sky: New Scientist, October 2, 1993 Tokyo's only fire helicopter has even been used in simulation tests to see what the danger would be if a fire were to break out in the building. Triple-decker high speed elevators which would be used in the building are also being designed in labs outside Tokyo.
Although this project has gained more serious attention than many of its alternatives, it can be considered similar to projects  as X-Seed 4000 and to ultra-high density, mixed use concepts such as Paolo Soleri's Arcology and Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse.
If completed, the Sky City 1000 would be the tallest man-made structure in the world, edging out the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It would share this record with Kingdom Tower.

Cherry eye is a congenital disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats.Gelatt, K. N. (2000). Essentials of Veterinary Ophthalmology. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two.Gelatt, K. N. (2001). Color Atlas of Veterinary Ophthalmology. Baltimore: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Common misnomers include adenitis, hyperplasia, adenoma of the gland of the third eyelid; however, cherry eye is not caused by hyperplasia, neoplasia, or primary inflammation.Slatter, D. (2001). Fundamentals of Veterinary Ophthalmology: Third Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company. In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production.Robledo, E. P., Serrano, R. D., Sanches, N. Q., & Ramirez, A. M. (n.d.). "Effect of Pet Vision in a Canine with Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye)". Retrieved 1 December 2012. Normally, the gland can evert without detachment. Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita. This defect causes the gland to prolapse and protrude from the eye as a red fleshy mass. Problems arise as sensitive tissue dries out and is subjected to external trauma Exposure of the tissue often results in secondary inflammation, swelling, or infection. If left untreated, this condition can lead to Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and other complications.

[[Pall-bearer]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs, Personal care and service occupations

A pallbearer is one of several funeral participants who helps carry the casket of a deceased person from a religious or memorial service or viewing either directly to a cemetery or mausoleum, or to and from the hearse which carries the coffin.  
A pall is the heavy cloth that is draped over a coffin. The term "pallbearer" is used to signify someone who bears the coffin which the pall covers.
Some traditions[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl] distinguish between these two roles, with pallbearer being a ceremonial  position, just carrying a tip of the pall or a cord attached to it, while casket bearers do the actual heavy lifting and carrying. There may otherwise be only pallbearers in the literal sense while the casket is on an animal, or on an animal-drawn or motorized vehicle. 
In western cultures, the pallbearers are usually male family members (Sons, Grandsons, Nephews and Son-in-laws), close friends, or colleagues of the deceased. In some Asian cultures, pallbearers are not to be members of the family but are outsiders, given a tip to perform the services of pall-bearer[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl].
A pall-bearer in the USA will carry a casket by the handles, and at around waist height.  In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the casket is carried on the shoulders, and the handles are for the most part decorative. All lifting should be done from underneath the casket.

Mary Edwards Walker (November 26, 1832 – February 21, 1919) was an American feminist, abolitionist, prohibitionist, alleged spy, prisoner of war and surgeon. She is currently the only woman ever to receive the Medal of Honor.
Prior to the American Civil War she earned her medical degree, married and started a medical practice. The practice didn't do well and she volunteered with the Union Army at the outbreak of the American Civil War and served as a surgeon. She was captured by Confederate forces after crossing enemy lines to treat wounded civilians and arrested as a spy. She was sent as a prisoner of war to Richmond, Virginia until released in a prisoner exchange.
After the war she was approved for the highest United States Armed Forces decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor, for her efforts during the Civil War. She is the only woman to receive the medal and one of only eight civilians to receive it. Her name was deleted from the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 and restored in 1977. After the war she was a writer and lecturer supporting the women's suffrage movement until her death in 1919.

[[Japanese television drama]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese entertainment terms, Japanese television dramas

[tpl]nihongo|Japanese television drama|テレビドラマ|terebi dorama|television drama[/tpl], also called [tpl]nihongo|dorama|ドラマ[/tpl], are a staple of Japanese television and are broadcast daily.  All major TV networks in Japan produce a variety of drama series including  romance, comedy, detective stories, horror, and many others. For special occasions, there may also be a one- or two-episode drama with a specific theme, such as a drama produced in 2007 for the 60-year anniversary of the end of World War II.
Japanese drama series are broadcast in three-month seasons, with new dramas airing each season. The majority of dramas are aired week-days in the evenings around 9:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m., or even 11:00 p.m. Dramas shown in the morning or afternoon are generally broadcast on a daily basis, and episodes of the same drama can be aired every day for several months, such as NHK's asadora, or morning dramas. The evening dramas, however, air weekly and are usually nine to twelve episodes long, though sometimes there will be an epilogue special made after the final episode if the drama has been a huge success.
Japan has four television seasons: Winter (January–March), Spring (April–June), Summer (July–September), and Autumn or Fall (October–December). Some series may start in another month though it may still be counted as a series of a specific season.
One characteristic of Japanese drama that differentiates it is that each episode is usually shot only a few (two to three) weeks before it is actually aired. Many fans have been able to visit their idols shooting scenes even as the show is still airing.

[[Allotransplantation]]

CATEGORIES: Transplantation medicine, Immunology

Allotransplantation (allo- from the Greek meaning "other") is the transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs, to a recipient from a genetically non-identical donor of the same species.Surgery For ACL Tears The transplant is called an allograft, allogeneic transplant, or homograft. Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts. A xenograft is a graft from a different species, such as when animal tissue is grafted to help humans.
It is not uncommon for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the scientific literature) to maintain the more precise distinction.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Homografts may be called "homostatic" if they are biologically inert when transplanted, such as bone and cartilage.(W. P. Longmire, J. National Cancer Institute 14, 669: The term homostatic graft might be applied to inert tissues such as bone and cartilage when transferred from one individual to another of the same species; and the term homovital graft might be used in reference to grafts whose cells must continue to grow and reproduce for the graft to be effective after similar transplantation; H. Conway, The Bulletin of the Hong Kong Chinese Medical Association 13, 43: ''These grafts persist however as homostatic grafts and are completely replaced by host tissues in time.)
An immune response against an allograft or xenograft is termed rejection. An allogenic bone marrow transplant can result in an immune attack, called Graft-versus-host disease.

2 Willow Road is part of a terrace of three houses in Hampstead, London designed by architect Ernő Goldfinger and completed in 1939. It has been managed by the National Trust since 1995 and is open to the public. It was one of the first modernist buildings acquired by the Trust, giving rise to some controversy. Goldfinger lived there with his wife Ursula and their children until his death in 1987.
1–3 Willow Road was constructed using concrete and a facing of red brick. A number of cottages were demolished to allow for the construction, which was strongly opposed by a number of local residents including novelist Ian Fleming (this was said to be his inspiration for the name of the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger) and the future Conservative Home Secretary Henry Brooke. No. 2, which Goldfinger designed specifically as his own family home, is the largest of the three houses and features a spiral staircase designed by Danish engineer Ove Arup at its core. The building is supported by a concrete frame, part of which is external, leaving room for a spacious uncluttered interior, perhaps inspired by the Raumplan ideas of modernist architect Adolf Loos.English Heritage listing details accessed 28 April 2007
Goldfinger himself designed much of the furniture in No. 2, and the house also contains a significant collection of 20th-century art by Bridget Riley, Marcel Duchamp, Henry Moore and Max Ernst.
Entry is by timed ticket, and facilities are very limited. Nos. 1 and 3 remain private homes.

It measures approximately 2.5 by 8 miles (4 by 13 km), and has a maximum depth of 165 feet (50 m).  At [tpl]convert|9854|acre|km2|0[/tpl], it is Michigan's ninth largest inland lake.  Up to and through the American Civil War years Crystal Lake was known as "Cap Lake" due to the frequent whitecaps visible on its surface. Crystal Lake is adjacent to the southern reaches of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.
In 1873, an effort was made to connect Crystal Lake with Lake Michigan via a channel.  The lake level of Crystal Lake was higher than that of Lake Michigan and when the channel was opened, the water level in Crystal Lake dropped about [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl].  Although the project was a failure, the lowering of the lake level uncovered sandy beaches, including the current public beach at Beulah.[tpl]cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = Crystal Lake & Watershed Association | url = http://www.clwa.us/watershed_FAQ.htm | accessdate = December 2013[/tpl]
The watershed that feeds Crystal Lake is very small, and fertilizer and sewage outflows are minimal, leading to the exceptionally clear and beautiful water that gives it its current name.  The surface area of the lake is 35% of the total area of the drainage basin (land and water combined).

NEdit, the Nirvana editor, is a text editor and source code editor for the X Window System. It has an interface similar to text editors on Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, rather than to older UNIX editors like Emacs. It was initially developed by Mark Edel for Fermilab and released under a very restrictive licence, but today it is distributed under the less restrictive GNU General Public License (plus Motif clause ¹), and developed as an independent open source project by a team of developers. Nedit was also distributed with the IRIX operating system.
NEdit is extensible through a C-like macro language, and features automatic indentation and syntax highlighting for a wide variety of computer languages. NEdit can also process tags files generated using the Unix ctags command or the Exuberant Ctags program.
Its user interface is built using the Motif toolkit, which made it an immediate success with a wide range of proprietary Unix platforms whose user interfaces use the toolkit. For a fully open source version, the alternative LessTif library can be used instead.
There has not been a release since v5.5 in 2004 and major development on SourceForge stopped in 2010,http://sourceforge.net/projects/nedit/stats/scm?repo=CVSRepository&dates=2010-01-01+to+2012-07-31 with minor updates being made as recently as October 2012.http://sourceforge.net/projects/nedit/stats/scm?repo=CVSRepository&dates=2012-10-01+to+2012-11-01

Opera Mail (formerly known as M2) is the email and news client developed by Opera Software. It was an integrated component within the Opera web browser from version 2 through 12. With the release of Opera 15 in 2013, Opera Mail became a separate product and is no longer bundled with Opera.Opera Desktop Team - Opera Mail Opera Mail version 1.0 is available for OS X and Windows. It features spam filtering (both automated and Bayesian), a contact manager, and supports POP3 and IMAP, newsgroups as well as Atom and RSS feeds.
Opera Mail uses one database that keeps an index of all mail, and sorts the messages automatically into several "views" or accesspoints. Messages are automatically sorted by type, such as mailing lists, and mail with attachments . This approach to indexing allows for quicker access to messages. For instance, a message sent to a mailing list with a word document attached will appear in both the "Documents" attachment view and in the "Mailing lists" view. Opera Mail can also use Bayesian filtering to automatically sort messages into other views. All messages in the database are accessed by opening the "Received" view.
The integrated mail component included a simple IRC client, but this is no longer present in the standalone program. The IRC client supported multiple servers, file transfers, and interface customization through CSS.
Opera Mail can display text and HTML emails and uses the Presto layout engine to display HTML.
With the release of Opera 9.5, Opera Mail featured a new backend to increase speed and extend IMAP support.Opera Watch Interview with the lead developer of the Opera Mail Client (M2), URL accessed on July 11, 2007

[[Spaceship (cellular automaton)]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular automaton patterns

In a cellular automaton, a finite pattern is called a spaceship if it reappears after a certain number of generations in the same orientation but in a different position. The smallest such number of generations is called the period of the spaceship.
This notation can be readily generalised to cellular automata with dimensionality other than two.
A tagalong is a pattern that is not a spaceship in itself but that can be attached to the back of a spaceship to form a larger spaceship. Similarly, a pushalong is placed at the front.
A pattern that, when a spaceship is input, outputs a copy of the spaceship travelling in a different direction is called a reflector.
Spaceships are important because they can sometimes be modified to produce puffers. Spaceships can also be used to transmit information. For example, in Conway's Game of Life, the ability of the glider (Life's simplest spaceship) to transmit information is part of a proof that Life is Turing-complete.

[[Failover]]
CATEGORIES: Computer networking, Fault-tolerant computer systems

In computing, failover is switching to a redundant or standby computer server, system, hardware component or network upon the failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application,[ref]
For application-level failover, see for example 
.
[/ref] server, system, hardware component, or network. Failover and switchover are essentially the same operation, except that failover is automatic and usually operates without warning, while switchover requires human intervention.
Systems designers usually provide failover capability in servers, systems or networks requiring continuous availability -- the used term is High Availability -- and a high degree of reliability.
At server level, failover automation usually uses a "heartbeat" cable that connects two servers. As long as a regular "pulse" or "heartbeat" continues between the main server and the second server, the second server will not initiate its systems. There may also be a third "spare parts" server that has running spare components for "hot" switching to prevent downtime. The second server takes over the work of the first as soon as it detects an alteration in the "heartbeat" of the first machine. Some systems have the ability to send a notification of failover.
Some systems, intentionally, do not failover entirely automatically, but require human intervention. This "automated with manual approval" configuration runs automatically once a human has approved the failover.
Failback is the  process of restoring a system, component, or service in a state of failover back to its original state (before failure).
The use of virtualization software has allowed failover practices to become less reliant on physical hardware; see also teleportation (virtualization)

He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman during the dead ball era. McKechnie was the first manager to win World Series titles with two different teams (1925 Pittsburgh Pirates and 1940 Cincinnati Reds), and remains one of only two managers to win pennants with three teams, also capturing the National League title in 1928 with the St. Louis Cardinals. His 1,892 career victories ranked fourth in major league history when he ended his managing career in 1946, and trailed only John McGraw's NL total of 2,669 in league history. He was nicknamed "Deacon" because he sang in his church choir and generally lived a quiet life.

SimTower: The Vertical Empire (known as The Tower in Japan) is a construction and management simulation video game developed by OpenBook Co., Ltd. and published by Maxis for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994. In Japan, it was published by OpenBook that same year and was later released for the Sega Saturn[tpl]cite web |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/saturn/577609-the-tower |title=Release Information |publisher=GameFAQs.com[/tpl] and Sony PlayStation[tpl]cite web |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/573681-the-tower-bonus-edition |title=Release Information |publisher=GameFAQs.com[/tpl] in 1996. The game allows players to build and manage a tower and decide what facilities to place in it, in order to ultimately build a five-star tower. Random events take place during play, such as terrorist acts that the player must respond to immediately.
Critical reception towards the game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature and its ability to immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.

The Kerry Blue Terrier is a breed of dog.  In Ireland it is often called the Irish Blue Terrier. Originally bred to control "vermin" including rats, rabbits, badgers, foxes, otters and hares, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep, and as a guard dog. Today the Kerry has spread around the world as a companion and working dog. Despite winning Crufts (the most important UK dog show) in 2000,http://crufts.fossedata.co.uk/Group.asp?ShowYear=2000&GroupID=TER it remains an unfashionable breed,http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/collinss-beloved-kerry-blue-breed-at-risk-in-the-uk-26815879.html still distinctly uncommon, but not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

The Isokon building in Lawn Road, Hampstead, London, is a concrete block of 34 flats designed by architect Wells Coates for Molly and Jack Pritchard. They were built between 1933 and 1934 as an experiment in communal living. Most of the flats had very small kitchens as there was a large communal kitchen for the preparation of meals, connected to the residential floors via a dumb waiter. Services, including laundry and shoe-shining, were provided on site.
Early famous residents included Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Agatha Christie (1940–46), László Moholy-Nagy, Adrian Stokes, Egon Riss and Arthur Korn. Jack and Molly Pritchard lived in the penthouse. The communal kitchen was converted into the Isobar restaurant in 1937. In the mid-1930s Flat 7[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] was occupied by Dr Arnold Deutsch, the NKVD agent who recruited the Cambridge Five. James Stirling was a resident during the 1960s.
The Isokon company folded during World War II. In 1969 the Isobar was converted into flats and in 1972 the building was sold to Camden London Borough Council, and gradually deteriorated until the 1990s when it was abandoned and lay derelict for several years. In 2003, the building was sympathetically refurbished by Avanti Architects, a practice which specialise in the refurbishment of Modernist buildings, for Notting Hill Housing Association and is now primarily occupied by key workers under a co-ownership scheme. The refurbishment has also created a public gallery space.
The block has been granted Grade I listed status, placing it amongst the most architecturally-significant historical buildings in the UK.

CATEGORIES: Time travel novels, 1980 novels, American science fiction novels, John W. Campbell Award for Best Science Fiction Novel winning works, Nebula Award for Best Novel winning works, Novels by Gregory Benford, Novels set in Cambridge, University of Cambridge in fiction

Timescape is a 1980 novel by science fiction writer Gregory Benford (with unbilled co-author Hilary Foister). It won the 1980 Nebula and British Science Fiction Awards, and the 1981 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel was widely hailed by both critics of science fiction and mainstream literature for its fusion of detailed character development and interpersonal drama with more standard science fiction fare such as time travel and ecological issues."Timescape is a genuine marriage of science and literature...Bridging the two cultures of scientists and humanists, it provides an intriguing vision of reality suggested by contemporary physics, and also an absorbing portrayal of people facing challenges both scientific and personal. Benford suggests parallels between the unfamiliar concepts of modern physics that are central to its plot and the familiar human perceptions and problems of its characters. Timescape offers both scientific and humanistic perspectives on the nature of reality." pg 486, Susan Stone-Blackburn
Pocket Books used the title of this book for their science fiction imprint.

Chasing Vermeer is a 2004 children's art mystery  written by Blue Balliett and illustrated by Brett Helquist. Set in Hyde Park, Chicago near the University of Chicago, the novel follows two children, Calder Pillay and Petra Andalee. After a famous Johannes Vermeer painting is stolen while they are on the way to their art gallery, Calder and Petra work together to try to recover it. The thief publishes many advertisements in the newspaper, explaining that he will give the painting back if the community can discover which paintings under Vermeer's name were really painted by him. This causes Petra, Calder, and the rest of Hyde Park to examine art more closely. Themes of art, chance, coincidence, deception, and problem-solving are apparent.
The novel was written for Balliett's classroom intended to deal with real-world issues. Balliett values children's ideas and wrote the book specifically to highlight that. Chasing Vermeer has won several awards, including the Edgar and the Agatha. In 2006, the sequel entitled The Wright 3 was published, followed by The Calder Game in 2008.

Hangmen Also Die! is a 1943 noir war film directed by the Austrian director Fritz Lang and written by John Wexley from a story by Bertolt Brecht and Lang. The film stars Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, Brian Donlevy, Walter Brennan, Alexander Granach and Anna Lee, and features Gene Lockhart and Dennis O'Keefe. The music is by Hanns Eisler and James Wong Howe served as cinematographer.
The film is loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Reich Protector of German-occupied Prague, number-two man in the SS, and a chief architect of the Holocaust, who was known as "The Hangman of Prague."  The real Heydrich was assassinated by Czech resistance fighters parachuted from a British plane in Operation Anthropoid, but in the movie, which was made during World War II before the full story had become public knowledge, Heydrich's killer is depicted as a member of the Czech resistance with ties to the Communist Party.
Hangmen Also Die! was Bertolt Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film: the money he earned from the project enabled him to write The Visions of Simone Machard, Schweik in the Second World War and an adaptation of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. Hanns Eisler was nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi Germany–Lang, Brecht and Eisler–is an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had in American culture.

[[Constitution of the Year VIII]]

CATEGORIES: Defunct constitutions, Constitutions of France, 1799 events of the French Revolution, Legal history of France

The Constitution of the Year VIII ([tpl]lang-fr|Constitution de l'an VIII[/tpl]) was a national constitution of France, adopted December 24, 1799 (during the Year VIII of the French Revolutionary Calendar), which established the form of government known as the Consulate. The coup of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) effectively gave all power to Napoleon Bonaparte, and in the eyes of some, ended the French Revolution.
After the coup, Napoleon and his allies legitimized his position by creating the "short and obscure Constitution of the Year VIII" (as Malcolm Crook has called it). 
The constitution tailor-made the position of First Consul to give Napoleon most of the powers of a dictator. It was the first constitution since the Revolution without a Declaration of Rights.
The executive power was vested in three Consuls, but all actual power was held by the First Consul, Bonaparte. This was no longer Robespierre's Republic, which was more radical, or the oligarchic liberal Republic of the Directory, but the autocratic Roman Republic of Caesar Augustus, a Conservative Republic, which reminded the French of stability, order, and peace. To emphasize this, Napoleon used classical Roman terms in the Constitution: Consul, Senator, Tribune.
The Constitution of Year VIII established a legislature of three houses, which was composed of: a Conservative Senate of 80 men over the age of 40, a Tribunate of 100 men, and a Legislative Body (Corps législatif) of 300 men.
The Constitution also used the term “notables.” The term “notables” was a common usage under the monarchy; every Frenchman understood it, and it was comforting. It referred to prominent, "distinguished" men: landholders, merchants, scholars, professionals, clergymen, officials. The people in each district chose a slate of "notables"  by popular vote. The First Consul, Tribunate, and Corps Législatif each nominated one Senatorial candidate to the rest of the Senate, which chose one candidate from among the three. Once all of its members were picked, it would then appoint the Tribunate, the Corps Législatif, the judges of cassation, and the commissioners of accounts from the slate of notables.
Napoleon held a plebiscite on the Constitution in December. The vote was not binding, but it allowed Napoleon to maintain a veneer of democracy. The vote was 3,000,000 in favor, and 1,500 against. 
This Constitution was amended, first, by the Constitution of the Year X, which made Napoleon First Consul for Life, more extensively altered by the Constitution of the Year XII which established the Bonaparte dynasty with Napoleon as a hereditary Emperor, abolished by the first, brief Bourbon Restoration of 1814, revived and at once virtually replaced by the so-called "Additional Act" of April 1815 promulgated on Napoleon's brief return; and definitively abolished by the return of Louis XVIII later in 1815 (following the Hundred Days). The Napoleonic constitutions were then completely replaced by the Charter of 1814.

The Constitution of the Year XII was a national constitution of France adopted during the Year XII of the French Revolutionary Calendar (1804 in the Gregorian calendar).
It amended the earlier Constitution of the Year VIII and Constitution of the Year X, establishing the First French Empire with Napoleon Bonaparte — previously First Consul for Life, with wide-ranging powers — as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. The Constitution established the House of Bonaparte as France's imperial dynasty, making the throne hereditary in Napoleon's family. The Constitution of the Year XII was later itself extensively amended by the so-called "Additional Act" and definitively abolished with the final return of the Bourbons in 1815.

[[Experimental evolution]]

CATEGORIES: Evolutionary biology, Biology experiments

In evolutionary and experimental biology, the field of experimental evolution is concerned with testing hypotheses and theories of evolution by use of controlled experiments. Evolution may be observed in the laboratory as populations adapt to new environmental conditions and/or change by such stochastic processes as random genetic drift. With modern molecular tools, it is possible to pinpoint the mutations that selection acts upon, what brought about the adaptations, and to find out how exactly these mutations work. Because of the large number of generations required for adaptation to occur, evolution experiments are typically carried out with microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast or viruses.[tpl]cite journal |author=Buckling A, Craig Maclean R, Brockhurst MA, Colegrave N |title=The Beagle in a bottle |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=824–9 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19212400 |doi=10.1038/nature07892[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Elena SF, Lenski RE |title=Evolution experiments with microorganisms: the dynamics and genetic bases of adaptation |journal=Nat.

[[Madoc]]
CATEGORIES: American folklore, Medieval legends, Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, Welsh explorers, Welsh mythology, Welsh royalty, Myth of origins, Welsh people of Irish descent

Madoc or Madog ab Owain Gwynedd was, according to folklore, a Welsh prince who sailed to America in 1170, over three hundred years before Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Madog+ab+Owain+Gwynedd |title=Madoc|publisher=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia |accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] According to the story, he was a son of Owain Gwynedd, and took to the sea to flee internecine violence at home. The "Madoc story" legend evidently evolved out of a medieval tradition about a Welsh hero's sea voyage, to which only allusions survive. However, it attained its greatest prominence during the Elizabethan era, when English and Welsh writers wrote of the claim that Madoc had come to the Americas as an assertion of prior discovery, and hence legal possession, of North America by the Kingdom of England.[tpl]sfn|Fowler|2000|p=54[/tpl]
The "Madoc story" remained popular in later centuries, and a later development asserted that Madoc's voyagers had intermarried with local Native Americans, and that their Welsh-speaking descendants still live somewhere in America. These "Welsh Indians" were credited with the construction of a number of natural and man-made landmarks throughout the American Midwest, and a number of white travellers were inspired to go and look for them. The "Madoc story" has been the subject of much speculation in the context of possible pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. No historical or archaeological proof of such a man or his voyages has been found in the New or Old World; however speculation abounds connecting him with certain sites, such as Devil's Backbone, located on the Ohio River at Fourteen Mile Creek near Louisville, Kentucky.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsandtribune.com/clarkcounty/x519388801/The-Madoc-legend-lives-in-Southern-Indiana-Documentary-makers-hope-to-bring-pictures-to-author-s-work |title=The Madoc legend lives in Southern Indiana: Documentary makers hope to bring pictures to author's work|author=Curran, Kelly|date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2011|publisher=News and Tribune, Jeffersonville, Indiana[/tpl]

[[X-Seed 4000]]
CATEGORIES: Skyscrapers in Japan, Unbuilt buildings and structures

The X-Seed 4000 is the tallest building ever fully envisioned, meaning that the designs for construction have been completed.Accelerating Future The idea was initially created and developed by Peter Neville.  Its proposed [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] height, [tpl]convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] wide sea-base, and 800 floor capacity could accommodate 500,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants. This structure would be composed of over 3,000,000 tons of reinforced steel.  
It was designed for Tokyo, Japan by the Taisei Corporation in 1995Contemporary Theories of Architecture Brief - the Digital Studio as a futuristic environment combining ultra-modern living and interaction with nature.Taisei Construction Co. Ltd Methods of transportation within the X-seed would most likely include MagLev trains.
The X-Seed 4000 "is never meant to be built," says Georges Binder, managing director of Buildings & Data, a firm which compiles data banks on buildings worldwide. "The purpose of the plan was to earn some recognition for the firm, and it worked."X-Seed Inspires Tall Tales | News | Architectural Record
Unlike conventional skyscrapers, the X-Seed 4000 would be required to actively protect its occupants from considerable air pressure gradations and weather fluctuations along its massive elevation. Its design calls for the use of solar power to maintain internal environmental conditions. Also, the proposed area is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is the most active volcano range in the world so X-Seed 4000 would be subject to tsunamis and earthquakes. The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid (also planned for Tokyo, Japan) faces most of the same problems.
A sea-based location and a Mount Fuji shape are some of this building's other major design features — the real Mount Fuji is land-based and is 3776 m (2.35 miles) high, 224 m shorter than X-Seed 4000. The X-Seed 4000 is projected to be twice the height of the Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid at 2004 m. Other projects that may be in the top five man made structures are the Dubai City Tower (2400 m) and the Bionic Tower (1228 m) in either Hong Kong or Shanghai. These structures will all be in Asia.
Some estimate that the cost to construct the X-Seed 4000 structure may be somewhere between US$300–900 billion, in 2006 dollars ($[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|500000000000|2006|r=-8[/tpl][/tpl]–$[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|900000000000|2006|r=-8[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]).

[[Logic bomb]]
CATEGORIES: Types of malware

A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be terminated from the company.
Software that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the 13th or April Fool's Day. Trojans that activate on certain dates are often called "time bombs".
To be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.

The Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire ([tpl]lang-de|Reichskrone[/tpl]) is the hoop crown ([tpl]lang-de|Bügelkrone[/tpl]) of the King of the Romans, the rulers of the German Kingdom, since the High Middle Ages. Most of the kings were crowned with it. It was made probably somewhere in Western Germany, either under Otto I (with additions by Conrad II),The Encyclopædia Britannica states that the Imperial Crown was probably made for Otto I in the workshops of Reichenau Abbey, by Conrad II or Conrad III during the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The first preserved mention of it is from the 12th century—assuming it is the same crown, which seems very probable.
Along with the Imperial Cross ([tpl]lang-de|Reichskreuz[/tpl]), the Imperial Sword ([tpl]lang-de|Reichsschwert[/tpl]), and the Holy Lance ([tpl]lang-de|Heilige Lanze[/tpl]), the crown was the most important part of the Imperial Regalia ([tpl]lang-de|Reichskleinodien[/tpl]). During the coronation, it was given to the new king along with the sceptre ([tpl]lang-de|Reichszepter[/tpl]) and the Imperial Orb ([tpl]lang-de|Reichsapfel[/tpl]). The Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire, especially the Imperial Crown, were all kept 1424–1796 in Nuremberg, Franconia—and could only leave the city for the coronation.
Currently, the crown and the rest of the Imperial Regalia are exhibited at the Hofburg in Vienna—officially "until there is again a Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation".[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
An identical copy is in Aachen in Germany in the Krönungssaal of Charlemagne's former palace, now the town hall. There are also copies of the crown and regalia in the historic museum of Frankfurt, as most of the later Emperors were crowned in the cathedral of the city, as well in the fortress of Trifels in the Electorate of the Palatinate, where the Imperial Crown was stored in medieval times.

The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season was tied with 1932, 1969, and 1994 for most named storms in Atlantic Ocean during the month of November – only to be surpassed in 2001 and 2005. The season officially began on June 1, 1980, and lasted until November 30, 1980. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.
The season was fairly active, with fifteen tropical cyclones forming. It was the first time since the 1971 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the month of June. The season was neutral, having neither an El Niño nor a La Niña. Three tropical cyclones during in the Atlantic Ocean in 1980 were notable. Hurricane Allen was then the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the Caribbean Sea, Mexico, and the United States. Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding in Mexico, which resulted in at least 38 fatalities. Hurricane Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the Gulf of Mexico and not make landfall.

The authority to detain material witnesses dates to the First Judiciary Act of 1789, but the Bail Reform Act of 1984 most recently amended the text of the statute, and it is now codified at [tpl]usc|18|3144[/tpl].  The most recent version allows material witnesses to be held to ensure the giving of their testimony in criminal proceedings or to a grand jury.  
Since September 11, 2001, the U.S. has used the material witness statute to detain suspects without charge for indefinite periods of time, often under the rubric of securing grand-jury testimony.  This use of the statute is controversial and is currently under judicial review. In Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011), the detainee was never charged or called as a witness, and sued the U.S. Attorney General in office at the time he was held. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and held that John Ashcroft had immunity because of his official position.

[[Midlands (Tasmania)]]
CATEGORIES: Midlands (Tasmania)

The Midlands  is a region of Tasmania between Launceston and Hobart. It also refers to the relatively flat, dry agricultural area, so named because it covers the region between the two cities. Its name is probably also influenced from the Midlands in the United Kingdom. It lends its name to the Southern Midlands Council, Northern Midlands Council, and the Midland Highway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northernmidlands.tas.gov.au/site/page.cfm|title=Welcome | publisher= Northern Midlands Council| work = | last= |first= |date=|accessdate= 19 December 2009[/tpl] The region is sometimes conflated or confused with the adjacent region of the Central Highlands—with the added term Tasmania's heartland.http://www.tasmaniacentral.tas.gov.au Midlands Initiatives for Local Enterprise Inc, 2002  described as Gateway to online information on all aspects of life, including local government, in Tasmania's heartland.  The portal is a joint initiative of the Northern Midlands, the Southern Midlands, and the Central Highlands Councils
Geographically, most of the Midlands is a region of relatively low plains drained mostly by tributaries of the Tamar River in the north and  Jordan River in the south.  The natural vegetation was predominantly grassland, but all of it is either grazed by cattle and sheep or cleared for growing better pasture species.  On the eastern side it rises into low, unglaciated dolerite hills and mountains, largely covered with dry sclerophyllous forests, but on the west lies the high doleritic Lake Country, which was extensively glaciated during Quaternary glacial periods and is covered with large numbers of lakes consequently carved into the very hard and erosion-resistant rock.
The climate of the Midlands is the driest in Tasmania, with annual rainfalls ranging from 450 to 600 millimetres (18 to 23 inches). Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and the region is less prone to very heavy rainfalls than the eastern coast of Tasmania.  Because it is not surrounded by sea, the Midlands has both the warmest summers and some of the coldest winters in Tasmania.  In summer, maximum temperatures average 24°C (75°F), whilst in winter most days have frosts, sometimes severe.  The lowest temperature in the region is around -12°C (10°F) in 1902, when snow fell in Hobart city.
Owing to the relatively low rainfall and the presence of recently eroded fertile dolerite rocks, the soils are the most fertile in all of Tasmania.  Most of them are quite close to the chernozems of Asia and North America, and consequently the Midlands is rich grazing land supporting intensive rearing of sheep. Some grain crops are also grown, though the summers are rather cool for them.

[[João Saldanha]]

João Alves Jobin Saldanha (3 July 1917 in Alegrete, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil - 12 July 1990 in Rome, ItalyBirth/death info at sambafoot.com [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]) was a journalist and football manager. He coached the Brazil national football team during the South American Qualifying to the 1970 FIFA World Cup.
Saldanha was nicknamed João Sem Medo and played football for Botafogo. He then entered journalism and became one of Brazil's most prolific sport writers. He often criticised players, managers and teams, and was a member of the Brazilian Communist Party.
In 1957, Botafogo appointed him as their coach, despite his lack of managerial experience. The club won the Rio state championship that season, but Saldanha resigned from the club in 1959.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.futebolthebrazilianwayoflife.com/AskAlex.aspx?month=July&year=2003 |title=Ask Alex anything about Brazilian football... |author=Alex Bellos |date=July 2003 |work=Futebol: The Brazilian way of life |publisher=ofutebol.com |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070810061137/http://www.futebolthebrazilianwayoflife.com/AskAlex.aspx?month=July&year=2003 |archivedate=10 August 2007[/tpl]  In 1969, he was invited to take charge of the national team, and led them to a perfect 6-0 record. It is alleged that soccer federation president João Havelange appointed him in the hope that journalists would be less critical of the national team if one of their own was in charge.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.futebolthebrazilianwayoflife.com/AskAlex.aspx?year=2003&month=June  |title=Ask Alex anything about Brazilian football... |author=Alex Bellos |date=June 2003 |work=Futebol: The Brazilian way of life |publisher=ofutebol.com |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929141357/http://www.futebolthebrazilianwayoflife.com/AskAlex.aspx?year=2003&month=June |archivedate = 29 September 2007[/tpl]
Saldanha was publicly criticised by Dorival Yustrich, coach of Flamengo. Saldanha responded by confronting him while brandishing a revolver. Saldanha was said to have fallen out of favour because of his unwillingness to select players who were personal favourites of President Emilio Garrastazu Médici, in particular striker Dario (Brazil was a military dictatorship back then). It's reported that Saldanha, after being told that President Médici would be pleased to see Dario in the team, answered that "well, I also have some suggestions to give in the President´s ministry choices". The last straw came when the assistant manager resigned, saying that Saldanha was impossible to work with.

Several alleged sightings have occurred in North America, but these cannot be authenticated since some American Coots (Fulica americana) lack red knobs on the frontal shield of the bill. The Caribbean Coot has sometimes been treated as a subspecies of the latter species.
The adult is [tpl]convert|33|-|38|cm|in[/tpl] long and has a short thick white bill with a reddish-brown spot near the tip and a white forehead shield. The body is grey with the head and neck darker than the rest of the body. The legs are yellow, with scalloped toes rather than webbed feet. It differs from the American Coot in that the latter species usually has red knobs at the top of its frontal shield.
The breeding habitat is freshwater lakes and  marshes. They build a nest in shallow water or floating, and lay 4-8 speckled whitish or pale brown eggs.   They are frequently seen swimming in open water.
Caribbean Coots can dive for food but can also forage on land. They are omnivores, eating plant material, insects, fish, and other aquatic animals.
Their call is a high-pitched squeaking honk somewhat like a goose, similar to American Coot.

CATEGORIES: Industrial occupations, Saws, Metalworking occupations

A saw filer or saw doctor is a person who maintains and repairs saws in a saw mill. A saw filer's work area in the mill is called the filing room.
Saws used in timber mills are very large and expensive. They need careful maintenance for safe operation. Repair of damaged saws requires a high degree of skill. It takes many years of full-time saw filing to become proficient in the trade.

[[Partition coefficient]]

CATEGORIES: Equilibrium chemistry, Medicinal chemistry, Solvents

In the physical sciences, a partition- or distribution-coefficient  is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible phases at equilibrium. These coefficients are a measure of the difference in solubility of the compound in these two phases.
In the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences, the two phases are often restricted to mean two immiscible solvents. In this context, a partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in the two phases of a mixture of two immiscible liquids at equilibrium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leo A, Hansch C, and Elkins D|title=Partition coefficients and their uses |journal=Chem Rev |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=525–616 |year=1971 |doi=10.1021/cr60274a001[/tpl] Normally one of the solvents chosen is water while the second is hydrophobic such as 1-octanol.[tpl]cite book |last=Sangster |first=James |title=Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients: Fundamentals and Physical Chemistry, Vol. 2 of Wiley Series in Solution Chemistry |publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |year=1997 |location=Chichester |pages=178 pages |isbn=978-0-471-97397-3[/tpl] Hence both the partition and distribution coefficient are measures of how hydrophilic ("water-loving") or hydrophobic ("water-fearing") a chemical substance is. In medical practice, partition coefficients are useful for example in estimating distribution of drugs within the body. Hydrophobic drugs with high octanol/water partition coefficients are preferentially distributed to hydrophobic compartments such as lipid bilayers of cells while hydrophilic drugs (low octanol/water partition coefficients) preferentially are found in hydrophilic compartments such as blood serum.
If one of the solvents is a gas and the other a liquid, the "gas/liquid partition coefficient" is the same as the dimensionless form of the Henry's law constant. For example, the blood/gas partition coefficient of a general anesthetic measures how easily the anesthetic passes from gas to blood. Partition coefficients can also be used when one or both solvents is a solid (see solid solution).
The phrase "partition coefficient" is now considered obsolete by IUPAC, and "partition constant", "partition ratio", or "distribution ratio" are all more appropriate terms that should be used.[tpl]cite book | author = Wilkinson, Andrew M.; McNaught, Alan D. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Compendium of Chemical Terminology: IUPAC Recommendations | edition = | language = | publisher = Blackwell Science | location = Oxford | year = 1997 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-86542-684-8 | oclc = | doi = 10.1351/goldbook | url =  | accessdate = | chapter = Partition Coefficient | chapterurl = http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04437.html [/tpl]

A Feast for Crows is the fourth of seven planned novels in the epic fantasy  series A Song of Ice and Fire  by American author George R. R. Martin. The novel was first published on 17 October 2005 in the United Kingdom,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0002247437|title=A Feast for Crows: Product Details (UK)|date=October 17, 2005|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=March 6, 2010[/tpl] with a United States edition following on 8 November 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553801503/|title=A Feast for Crows: Product Details (US)|date=November 8, 2005|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=March 6, 2010[/tpl]
In May 2005 Martin announced that the "sheer size" of his still-unfinished manuscript for A Feast for Crows had led him and his publishers to split the narrative into two books.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/done.html|title=Done.|last=Martin|first=George R.

A Feast for  Crows was published months later, and the concurrent novel A Dance with Dragons was released on July 12, 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/03/03/dance-with-dragons-date |title=Huge Game of Thrones news: Dance With Dragons publication date revealed! -- EXCLUSIVE |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011[/tpl] Martin also noted that the A  Song of Ice and Fire series would now likely total seven novels.

One Country on Each Side ([tpl]zh|t=一邊一國|s=一边一国[/tpl]; pinyin: yī biān yī guó) was a concept espoused by Chen Shui-bian, the former President of the Republic of China (2000-2008), regarding the political status of Taiwan. It emphasised that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (commonly known as "Taiwan") are two different countries, (namely "One China, one Taiwan"), as opposed to two separate political entities within the same country of "China".   
Chen used this phrase in an August 3, 2002, telecast to the annual conference of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations meeting in Tokyo when he stated that it needs to be clear that "with Taiwan and China on each side of the Taiwan Strait, each side is a country."[tpl]cite web |title=Extracted text of the telecast relating to cross-strait relations |publisher=Mainland Affairs Council of Republic of China |date=2002-08-03 |url=http://www.mac.gov.tw/big5/mlpolicy/refer92/1_22.htm |language=Traditional Chinese |quote=台灣不是別人的一部分；不是別人的地方政府、別人的一省[/tpl] His statements were made in Taiwanese as opposed to Mandarin and drew a barrage of criticism from the mainland Chinese press, which had previously shied away from the type of attacks it gave to Lee Teng-hui, who promoted a similar "Special state-to-state relations". The United States also expressed serious concerns over this concept, as the US felt that this concept appeared to have departed from Chen's earlier pledge of "Four Noes and One Without".Taiwanese Leader Condemns Beijing, 'One China' Policy

Alfred Frenzel (1899-1968) was a West German member of parliament, who was secretly conducting espionage for Czechoslovakia while serving on the Bundestag's Defense Committee.  Given the code name Anna by the StB, he passed along classified information to the Communist government in Prague for five years, until his arrest in Bonn on October 31, 1960.  Allen W. Dulles, The Craft of Intelligence (Lyons Press, 2006) p108; "Bonn Deputy Held as Spy for Czechs; Bundestag Aide Had Access to State and NATO Secrets -- Seized in Parliament", New York Times, October 30, 1960, p13   He was the most important StB spy during the entire Cold War.
During World War II, after the invasion of his homeland by Nazi Germany, Frenzel worked as an agent for the government in exile in the United Kingdom. After the end of the war, Czechoslovakia became a communist state, and Frenzel emigrated to West Germany.
The new state intelligence service in Czechoslovakia, the StB, examined the files of pre-war intelligence officers, and found information on Frenzel's pre-war activities. When they discovered that Frenzel had been appointed to the parliamentary defence committee responsible for remilitarising West Germany and establishing her place in NATO, the StB leapt on this opportunity to recruit such a highly placed spy.

The Second Council of Lyon was the fourteenth ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, convoked on 31 March 1272 and convened in Lyon, France, in 1272–1274."Gregory X convoked the general council on 31 March 1272 . . outlined three themes: union with the Greeks, the crusade, and the reform of the church. Regarding the third theme, which was not only traditional in medieval councils but was also required by the actual state of ecclesiastical morals, the pope in March 1273 sought the opinion of all christian people and asked for their help. After long preparatory arrangements the council assembled at Lyons and opened on 7 May 1274 . . .  The Greeks arrived late, on 24 June, since they had been shipwrecked . . . The council had six general sessions: on 7 and 18 May, 4 (or 7) June, and in July on the 6th, the 16th and 17th.

Due to the great number of attendees, those who had come to Lyon without being specifically summoned were given "leave to depart with the blessing of God" and of the Pope. Among others who attended the council were James I of Aragon, the ambassador of the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos with members of the Greek clergy and the ambassadors of Abaqa Khan of the Ilkhanate. Thomas Aquinas had been summoned to the council, but died en route at Frosinone. Bonaventure was present at the first four sessions, but died at Lyon on 15 July.
In addition to Aragon, which James represented in person, representatives of the kings of Germany, England, Scotland, France, the Spains and Sicily The Sicilian representation was that sent by Charles of Anjou, whom the Papacy had placed on the throne of Sicily in 1266, to the detriment of Aragonese claims.

In the procedures to be observed in the council, for the first time the nations appeared as represented elements in an  ecclesiastical council, as they had already become represented in the governing of medieval universities. This innovation marks a stepping-stone towards the acknowledgment of coherent ideas of nationhood, which were in the process of creating the European nation-states.
The main topics discussed at the council were the conquest of the Holy Land and the union of the Eastern and Western Churches. The first session took place on 7 May 1274 and was followed by five additional sessions on 18 May, 4 or 7 June, 6 July, 16 July and 17 July.  By the end of the council, thirty-one constitutions were promulgated. In the second session, the fathers approved the decree Zelus fidei, which contained no juridical statutes but rather summed up constitutions about the perils of the Holy Land, the means for paying for a proposed crusade, the excommunication of pirates and corsairs and those who protected them or traded with them, a declaration of peace among Christians, a grant of an indulgence for those willing to go on crusade, restoration of communion with the Greeks, and the definition of the order and procedure to be observed in the council. The Greeks conceded on the issue of the Filioque (two words added to the Nicene creed), and union was proclaimed, but the union was later repudiated by Andronicus II,Wetterau, Bruce. World history.

Septoplasty is a corrective surgical procedure done to straighten the nasal septum, the partition  between the two nasal cavities.

When it deviates into one of the cavities, it narrows that cavity and impedes airflow.  Often the inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed compensatory hypertrophy. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal obstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, the recovery time could be up to several weeks. Septoplasty is sometimes done with rhinoplasty for cosmetic correction of the deformities of the external nasal framework.

[[Call of the house]]

CATEGORIES: Parliamentary procedure

A call of the house is a motion which can be adopted by a deliberative assembly that has the authority to compel the attendance of its members in the absence of a quorum.  The effect of the adoption of this motion is that the president of the assembly makes out arrest warrants which authorize the sergeant-at-arms to arrest any or all absent members and bring them to the meeting hall so that a quorum may be present. This motion is usually seen in houses of legislatures, such as the United States Senate.
The act of a group of legislators deliberately failing to attend a legislative voting session to prevent quorum is sometimes used in situations where a group of representatives wants to delay or prevent passage of a bill that is almost certain to pass, and the dissenting representatives are in the minority and would otherwise be unable to stop the bill through normal legislative processes. This is discussed in more detail in the quorum article.
In state legislatures of the United States, a call of the house can be evaded by quorum-busters by leaving their state. Entering a neighboring state places them outside the jurisdiction of their own state's law enforcement, thus allowing them to prevent a quorum for as long as they are willing to remain away from home.
In the United Kingdom, the practice is in abeyance.http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/4311.htm

This freedom means that projective representations of quantum states are important in quantum theory.

[[Snowbelt]]
CATEGORIES: Belt regions of the United States, Geography of Canada, Climate of the United States, Climate of Canada

Snowbelt is a term describing of a number of regions near the Great Lakes in North America where heavy snowfall in the form of lake-effect snow is particularly common.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio's-snow-belt|title=Where is northern Ohio's snow belt?|author=Mark Johnson|publisher=News Channel 5|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] Snowbelts are typically found downwind of the lakes, principally off the eastern and southern shores. Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air moves over warmer water, taking up moisture that later precipitates as snow when the air moves over land and cools. The lakes produce snowsqualls and persistently cloudy skies throughout the winter months, as long as air temperatures are colder than water temperatures, or until a lake freezes over.
thumb|left|Northeast Ohio Primary and Secondary Snow BeltsIn the United States, snowbelts are located southeast of Lake Erie from Cleveland, Ohio to Buffalo, New York, and south of Lake Ontario stretching roughly from Rochester, New York to Utica, New York, and northward to Watertown, New York. Other snowbelts are located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan from Gary, Indiana northward through Western Michigan and Northern Michigan to the Straits of Mackinac, and on the eastern and southern shores of Lake Superior from northwest Wisconsin through the northern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Portions of the snowbelt are located in Ontario, Canada[tpl]cite web|url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/snowfall-coming-to-the-snow-belt-1.736941|title=Snowfall coming to the snow belt|publisher=The Canadian Press/CTV News|date=December 7, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] which includes the eastern shore of Lake Superior from Sault Ste. Marie northward to Wawa, as well as the eastern and southern shores of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay from Parry Sound to London. During the winter season, north-westerly winds cause frequent road closures, with Highway 21 on the Lake Huron coast and Highway 26 south of Georgian Bay as far east as Barrie, Ontario being strongly affected. The Niagara Peninsula and the north-eastern shores of Lake Ontario are especially hard-hit by heavy snowfall when south-western winds are predominant.
Lake Erie is the second smallest of the five Great Lakes and the most shallow. It can completely freeze over during winter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mlakeeffectsnow.html|title=What's the physics behind "lake effect snow"?|author=Staff: Straight Dope Science Advisory Board|publisher=The Straight Dope|date=May 30, 2002|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] Once frozen, lake-effect snow over land to the east and south of Lake Erie is temporarily alleviated. This does not end the possibility of a damaging winter storm. The Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977 that struck metropolitan Buffalo was a direct result of powder snow blown by high winds off Lake Erie, which had frozen earlier than normal. There was, for the region, no significant snowfall during the duration of the blizzard.
Healthy skiing industries have been established in snowbelt regions located near major centres such as Buffalo and Toronto. The Erie/Ontario snowbelt, which extends to the northern slopes of the Allegheny Plateau, has lent the region its nickname: ski country. To the south of Georgian Bay, ski resorts are found on the Niagara Escarpment at Blue Mountain and on the Oro Moraine.
Snowbelt conditions also are found on the west side of the Japanese island of Hokkaido and the west side of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. Here, cold winds blowing outward from the Siberian winter high pressure system pick up moisture while crossing the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk and release it as heavy snowfall over the respective land areas. Sweden's east coast can be affected by snowbelt conditions, particularly in the early winter when there is little ice on the Baltic Sea.

Edward Powys Mathers (28 August 1892 – 3 February 1939) was an English translator and poet, and also a pioneer of compiling advanced cryptic crosswords.
Powys Mathers was born in Forest Hill, London, the son of a newspaper proprietor. He was educated at Loretto and Trinity College, Oxford.
He is well known as the translator of J. C. Mardrus's French version of One Thousand Nights and One Night.  His English version of Mardrus appeared in 1923, and is known as Mardrus/Mathers. He is known also for the translations The Garden of Bright Waters: One Hundred and Twenty Asiatic Love Poems (1920); and of the Kashmiri poet Bilhana in Bilhana: Black Marigolds (1919), a free interpretation in the tradition of Edward FitzGerald. These are not scholarly works, and are in some cases based on intermediate versions in European languages. Some of his translations were set to music by Aaron Copland.
He was also a composer of cryptic crosswords for The Observer under the pseudonym "Torquemada" from 1926 until his death.  Under this pseudonym, he reviewed detective stories from 1934 to 1939.

Mathew Baker (1530–1613)BBC - History - British History in depth: Armada Gallery was one of the most renowned Tudor shipwrights, and the first to put the practice of shipbuilding down on paper.
The first list of 'Master Shipwrights' appointed 'by Patent' by Henry VIII of England included 'John Smyth, Robert Holborn, Richard Bull and James Baker,' in 1537. James Baker was responsible for many of the designs and the construction of King Henry's fleet. James designed the means of mounting cannon in a ship's lower levels, rather than on the top deck, an idea credited to King Henry.
Having been apprenticed to his father James,Mathew Baker and the Art of the Shipwright and having grown up in the surroundings of the dockyard, Mathew was appointed 'Master Shipwright' in 1572. As John Hawkins's reformed naval administration began to bring discipline to the craft of shipbuilding, Mathew Baker became perhaps the greatest ship designer of Tudor times, known to have built, among other ships, the Dreadnought, the Vanguard, the Merhonour and the Repulse.

Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, 1st Baronet RA (8 May 1735 – 15 October 1811) was a notable English portrait painter and later a politician.
The third son of architect George Dance the Elder, Dance (he added the 'Holland' suffix later in life) studied art under Francis Hayman, and like many contemporaries also studied in Italy. There he met Angelica Kauffman, and painted several historic and classical paintings.
On his return to England, he became a successful portrait painter. With Hayman and his architect brother George Dance the Younger, he was one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.
He was commissioned to paint King George III and his queen, plus Captain James Cook and actor David Garrick. His group portrait The Pybus Family (1769) is in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.www.ngv.vic.gov.au
In 1790, he gave up his artistic career and became Member of Parliament for East Grinstead in Sussex. He served this seat until 1802 when he moved to Great Bedwyn, serving until 1806. In 1807 he returned to East Grinstead, serving until his death in 1811. He was made a baronet in 1800, which became extinct upon his death.
He was married to Harriet, the daughter of Sir Cecil Bishopp, 6th Baronet and the widow of Thomas Dummer (died 1781), for whom his brother had designed the house at Cranbury Park, near Winchester.[tpl]cite web |title= Horninghold, Gartree Hundred |url=http://www.horninghold.org.uk/history/victoria%20county%20history%20of%20leicestershire_horninghold.pdf| date= |work= Victoria County History of Leicestershire |publisher= |accessdate=23 September 2009[/tpl] They lived at Little Wittenham Manor in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/bios/ndholland.html |title=Sir Nathaniel Dance Holland (1735-1811) |author=Ford, David Nash |year=2008 |work=Royal Berkshire History |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |accessdate=16 June 2011[/tpl] His wife survived him until 1825.

[[J. C. Mardrus]]
CATEGORIES: 1868 births, 1949 deaths, Arabic–French translators, Translators from Arabic, French physicians, Translators of One Thousand and One Nights

Joseph Charles Mardrus, otherwise known as "Jean-Charles Mardrus" (1868–1949), born in Cairo, was a French physician and a noted translator. Today he is best known for his translation of the Thousand and One Nights from Arabic into French, which was published from 1898 to 1904, and was in turn rendered into English by Powys Mathers. 
Mardrus's version of the Arabian Nights is racy, elegant, and highly readable.  It is mentioned explicitly in the pages of The Remembrance of Things Past.  Unfortunately, Mardrus inserted a lot of material of his own (he was as imaginative as Sheherezade herself), and his translation is therefore not wholly authentic, even though it is very well written and developed. Much of the homosexual material for example, though quite romantic, is an absolute invention of Mardrus himself, and so confuses the issue of actual homosexuality in the Nights, of which there is a substantial amount. Mardrus claimed that his translation was based on a previously unknown "Tunisian text".  But this definitely fictional manuscript was never seen by anyone else. 
As a doctor for the French government, he worked throughout to Morocco and the Far East. He produced other translations, some illustrated by the Swiss engraver François-Louis Schmied (1873–1941).
He married the novelist and poet Lucie Delarue-Mardrus in 1900. 
Elvira Buder was born in 1918 in Port Said, Egypt. At the age of 18 when the nuns at the convent boarding school she attended from the age of five, wanted her to become a teacher she promptly left for the Sorbonne University in Paris with Mardrus with neither the nuns' nor her mother's permission. Her father had died from an accident when she was three years old. According to Buder, Mardrus convinced her it was a good idea. It must have been 1936. Also according to Buder they travelled via Greece and Mardrus was a difficult although highly entertaining companion. He had a hunchback which she felt brought out the genius in him. She was clearly smitten. Soon after arriving in Paris war broke out and she found herself pregnant and in France on an Italian passport. Buder left France for Italy when the Germans occupied Paris. It is not clear whose child she was carrying. Buder claims Mardrus was not the father of her child. Much later they met for the last time when Buder had just married E.W.N. Mallows, son of C.E. Mallows Charles Edward Mallows. Again according to Buder, Mardrus said he thought she had married well if boring. He died shortly thereafter in a car accident. He was driving which apparently he was not licensed to do. It would seem they both enjoyed telling tales. It was through Mardrus that Buder met the poet and writer Louis Aragon as Mardrus was a friend of his Louis Aragon.

At the time of Queen Elizabeth I, Richard Chapman (born 1520, and died c.1592) was the owner of a private shipyard at Deptford, had the title of 'Queen's Master Shipwright,' and had been involved in the construction of river defences along the Thames, along with Peter Pett and Mathew Baker, two other important shipwrights of the time. Chapman was Master Shipwright of Woolwich and Deptford and built the first Ark Royal (initially ordered as a private venture as the Ark Ralegh, but taken over for the Queen while still on the stocks).
Chapman's father, John, was also a Master Shipwright and he also had strong ties to the important shipbuilding family, the Petts as his mother was Ann Pett and he was raised in the Pett household. The Chapman family itself, however, included several mariners whose origins appear to be in Devon and shipwrights who lived at Greenwich, working at this craft since the reign of the King Edward Ist (1239–1307).
Richard's son, Edmund Chapman, became 'Chief Joiner' to the Queen and owned significant property in Greenwich. Edmund provided land for the almshouses named 'Queen Elizabeth College', founded in 1574, and himself lived at 'Swanne House.'

Södermalm, often shortened to "Söder", is a district in central Stockholm. It covers the large island of the same name (formerly called "Åsön"). With a population of 99,685 (December 2008) it is one of the most densely populated districts of Scandinavia. Although Södermalm usually is considered an island, water to both its north and south does not flow freely but passes through locks.
Södermalm is connected to its surrounding areas by a number of bridges. It connects to Gamla Stan to the north by Slussen, a grid of road and rail and a lock that separates the lake Mälaren from the Baltic Sea, to Långholmen and Kungsholmen to the northwest by one of the city's larger bridges, Västerbron, to the islet Reimersholme to the west, to Liljeholmen to the southwest by the bridge Liljeholmsbron, to Årsta by Årstabron, to Johanneshov by Johanneshovsbron, Skanstullsbron and Skansbron to the south, and, finally, to Södra Hammarbyhamnen to the east by Danvikstull Bridge.
Administratively, Södermalm is part of Stockholm Municipality. It constitutes, together with Gamla stan and some other districts, from 2007 the administrative district Södermalms stadsdelsområde, often translated as Södermalm borough.

It was started by Ed Stastny and has been maintained by Stastny and a group of volunteers and supporters. 
From its beginning, SITO had a mission different from many established Internet art resources, in that rather than be an electronic journal of discussions or writings about art, it chose to be a repository for artwork in order to facilitate sharing and exposure.  As this was the Internet pre-World Wide Web, SITO accomplished this by using anonymous FTP sites.  Another important part of the SITO mission was to be open to all levels of artists, and at no cost.  SITO was one of the earliest online galleries, and this showcase of artwork has become known as the Artchive.
Popular pronunciations of SITO are SEE-toe and SIT-oh.  SITO was originally called OTIS, which was an acronym for "Operative Term is Stimulate".  The title SITO is merely a reversal of OTIS and is not officially an acronym, though some playful expansions have been suggested by users of the site.  One such expansion is "Still I Think OTIS", which has the distinction of containing a nested acronym.

Sargeist is a Finnish black metal band formed in 1999. Originally created as a solo project by Shatraug of the Finnish black metal act Horna, he was joined by other members since 2000, who were subsequently released from the band. After the demo recording Tyranny Returns (2001), the line-up was augmented by Hoath Torog and Horns, both from the Finnish black metal outfit Behexen, and this line-up has remained stable to this day. 
Both musically and lyrically, Sargeist stays close to the roots of Scandinavian "old school" black metal. Lyrical subjects thus often deal with Satanism and anti-Christian blasphemy, as well as darkness, depression, misanthropy and hate. The band's name combines the two German words, "sarg" (coffin) and "geist" (spirit, ghost), and derives from the song "The Old Coffin Spirit" by the black metal band Rotting Christ.

CATEGORIES: Hanging parrots, Birds of Southeast Asia, Birds of Indonesia, Flores Island (Indonesia)

The Wallace's Hanging Parrot (Loriculus flosculus) also known as the Flores Hanging Parrot, is a small (length: 11–12 cm) parrot endemic to the island of Flores.
This is an arboreal parrot. The male is predominantly green, with a red bill, a red spot on the throat, orange legs and dark red nape, bright red rump and uppertail-coverts. The female has the red on the throat reduced or absent.
This parrot qualifies as Endangered as it has a very small range and population. The main threat is habitat destruction. The current population is estimated at between 2500 and 10000.
It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, and biologist.[tpl]cite book|last=Beolens|first=Bo|title=Whose Bird?

[[Sangihe Hanging Parrot]]
CATEGORIES: Hanging parrots, Birds of Southeast Asia, Birds of Indonesia

The Sangihe Hanging Parrot (Loriculus catamene) is a small (length: 12-13.5 cm) parrot endemic to the small island of Sangihe, north of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
This is an arboreal parrot. It is predominantly green, with a red throat patch, rump, elongated uppertail-coverts and tip of tail.
In 2009 this parrot was downlisted from Endangered to Near Threatened because although it has a very small range within which there has been extensive forest loss and fragmentation, it apparently remains common in degraded and cultivated habitats and there is no evidence of a continuing decline. The current population is estimated at between 10000 and 46000 individuals.

[[Digital dictation]]

CATEGORIES: Digital dictation, Sound recording technology, Audio storage, Office equipment, Alexander Graham Bell, Transcription (linguistics)

Digital dictation is a method of recording and editing the spoken word in real-time. The recording is done by the use of a digital recorder. Digital recorders are lighter, have a longer battery life and are able to record for a lot longer utilizing the same media, as compared to analog tape based dictation machines. The files generated with digital recorders vary in size, depending on the manufacturer and the format the user chooses. The most common file formats that digital recorders generate have one of the extensions WAV, WMA or MP3. True dictation machines record in the DSS and DS2 format. 
The DSS and DS2 file formats compress audio allowing for greater portability. In some cases, speech is recorded where sound quality is paramount and transcription unnecessary, e.g. for broadcasting a theatre play; such recording uses techniques closer to high-fidelity music recording, rather than those discussed here.
Digital dictation offers several advantages over traditional cassette tape based dictation:
Dictation audio can be recorded in various audio file formats. Most digital dictation systems use a lossy form of audio compression based on modelling of the vocal tract to minimize hard disk space and optimize network utilization as files are transferred between users. (Note that WAV is not an audio encoding format, but a file format and has little or no bearing on the encoding rate (kbit/s), size or audio quality of the resulting file.)
Digital dictation is different from Speech Recognition where audio is analyzed by a computer using speech algorithms in an attempt to transcribe the document. With digital dictation the process of converting digital audio to text may be done using digital transcription software, typically controlled by a foot switch which allows the transcriber to PLAY, STOP, REWIND, and BACKSPACE.

that the interaction picture does not exist in an interacting, relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), something now commonly known as Haag's Theorem. Haag's original proof was subsequently generalized by a number of authors, notably Hall and Wightman,[ref]

that a Haag-like theorem also applies to free neutral scalar fields of different masses, which implies that the interaction picture cannot exist even under the absence of interactions.

The album was three years in the making, with musicians A.C. Newman and Dan Bejar writing songs as early as 1998. With encouragement from peers, they recorded an album with other Canadian musicians from groups including The Evaporators, Zumpano, and Destroyer.
Released in 2000, the album failed to chart in Canada or the United States, but positive reviews from music media led to the group having a sold-out tour. Critical acclaim was very positive, and the album received a score of 87 from Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/newpornographers/massromantic | title=The New Pornographers:Mass Romantic (2000): Reviews | work=Metacritic | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=2009-04-16[/tpl]

The Suomi KP/-31 (Suomi-konepistooli or "Submachine-gun Finland") was a submachine gun (SMG) of Finnish design used during World War II. It was a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP.
The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by manyCombat Guns – An Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Firearms"OSPREY, 1987 as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II, also the soon developed 71-round drum magazine was later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 submachine guns.http://guns.connect.fi/gow/suomi2.html The accuracy of the Suomi was superior to that of the mass-produced PPSh-41, thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel, with the same rate of fire and the equally large magazine capacity. The major disadvantage of the Suomi KP/-31 was its high production cost.
The Suomi KP/-31 also incorporated a few new design features, including an arrangement whereby the spring was mounted inside the bolt in order to make the gun shorter. Its 50-round quad-column "Casket" box magazine was more reliable than the early 40-round "bullets loaded nose down" drum magazine, and similar applications were used on the Argentinian C-4 submachine gun and present-day 60-round 5.45x39mm AK-74 compatible magazines.
The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy, founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti, Captain V. Korpela,  Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof. The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti.
The Suomi KP/-31 went into serial production in 1931 by Tikkakoski Oy and most of these weapons were bought by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces were equipped with about 4000 Suomi KP/-31 submachine guns when the Winter War started. During the course of the war, the design was altered with the addition of a muzzle brake, which increased the submachine gun's overall length by 55 mm. The revised version was designated KP/-31 SJR (suujarru, or "muzzle brake"). Aimo Lahti was displeased with this revision, believing that it decreased muzzle velocity and reduced the weapon's reliability, and even sought in vain to have the muzzle brake's designer court-martialed. Ultimately, roughly half of the KP/-31s in Finnish service were of the SJR version. Initially the KP/-31 was issued as a substitute for a light machine gun, and proved inadequate in this role. Instead, soldiers learned by trial and error how to use submachine guns to the best effect. By the time of the Continuation War, Finnish doctrine had been altered to include both a KP/-31 and a light machine gun (usually a captured Degtyaryov DP) in every infantry squad, and by 1943 this had been expanded to two KP/-31s per squad. KP/-31 production continued with the intention of adding a third submachine gun to each squad, but this plan was shelved in 1944 when the Continuation War ended.
A specialized bunker version was also produced in very small numbers (a total of 500 built) in 1941, the barrel shroud end of which was thinner and flattened to allow firing through the narrow ports of defensive bunkers.http://guns.connect.fi/gow/suomikp5.html This version had no shoulder stock and was equipped with a pistol grip. An even rarer version "900 kp 31 psv" http://guns.connect.fi/gow/suomikp5.htmlwas produced for use as a secondary gun in the firing ports of Vickers Alt B Type E 6-Ton tanks, but only a few dozen were built before production was canceled due to the outbreak of the Winter War. Production never resumed, as captured Degtyaryov DP machine guns proved far superior in this role. Like the bunker version, the tank version had a pistol grip and no buttstock, and it could be quickly removed from the tank and fitted with a standard barrel shroud for infantry use if needed. The tank version remained in the Finnish Army's inventory through the 1980s, despite the tank it was designed for being retired in 1959.
The Suomi KP was also manufactured under licence in Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland, where it was known as the Hispano-Suiza MP43/44.
In 2009, a semi-automatic version of the Suomi KP was produced for civilian sale in the United States,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tnwfirearms.com/guns_suomi_m31.shtml |title=TNW Firearms, Inc.

A Suomi submachine gun is the weapon used by a mass murderer in the Sjowall/Wahloo Swedish mystery novel The Laughing Policeman. In the novel, a character asks if the weapon is the Finnish version or the Swedish-licensed version. A detective says a Finnish-made version, though he uses the Swedish model number (m/37) in mentioning it.http://www.gotavapen.se/gota/artiklar/kpist/swede_45.htm

In quantum mechanics, the consistent histories approach is intended to give a modern interpretation of quantum mechanics, generalising the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and providing a natural interpretation of quantum cosmology.F. Dowker and A. Kent, "Properties of Consistent Histories", Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 3038 - 3041 (1995) This interpretation of quantum mechanics is based on a consistency criterion that then allows probabilities to be assigned to various alternative histories of a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the Schrödinger equation. In contrast to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly the Copenhagen interpretation, the framework does not include "wavefunction collapse" as a relevant description of any physical process, and emphasizes that measurement theory is not a fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics.

The Lockheed A-12 was a reconnaissance aircraft built for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by Lockheed's famed Skunk Works, based on the designs of Clarence "Kelly" Johnson. The aircraft was designated A-12, the 12th in a series of internal design efforts with the A referring to "Archangel", the internal code name of the aircraft. It competed in the CIA's Oxcart program against the Convair Kingfish proposal in 1959, and won for a variety of reasons.
The A-12's specifications were slightly better than those of the Kingfish, and its projected cost was significantly less. Convair's design had the smaller radar cross section, however, and CIA's representatives initially favored it for that reason. The companies' respective track records proved decisive. Convair's work on the B-58 had been plagued with delays and cost overruns, whereas Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget. In addition, it had experience running a “black” project.[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=Archangel: CIA's Supersonic A-12 Reconnaissance Aircraft - From Drawing Board to Factory Floor|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/from-the-drawing-board-to-factory-floor.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency[/tpl]
The A-12 was produced from 1962 to 1964, and was in operation from 1963 until 1968.  It was the precursor to the twin-seat U.S. Air Force YF-12 prototype interceptor, M-21 drone launcher, and the famous SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. The A-12's final mission was flown in May 1968, and the program and aircraft retired in June of that year. The program was officially revealed in the mid-1990s.Mclninch 1996, title page.
Over the life of the Oxcart project, the participating US government departments and officials associated the project name "Oxcart" specifically with the A-12. An Agency officer later wrote, "OXCART was selected from a random list of codenames to designate this R&D and all later work on the A-12. The aircraft itself came to be called that as well."[tpl]cite web|last=Robarge|first=David|title=ARCHANGEL: CIA's SUPERSONIC A-12 RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT Second Edition 2012|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/Archangel-2ndEdition-2Feb12.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Page 15[/tpl] The crews named the A-12 the Cygnus which was suggested by the pilot Jack Weeks to follow the Lockheed practice of naming aircraft after celestial bodies.Crickmore 2000, p. 16

With 109,011 km² of territory, it is the largest region in the nation as well as the most sparsely populated. Historically, the peoples of the East have been settled in Cameroonian territory for longer than any other of the country's many ethnic groups, the first inhabitants being the Baka (or Babinga) pygmies.
The East Region has very little industry, its main commerce consisting of logging, timber, and mining. Instead, the bulk of its inhabitants are subsistence farmers. The region is thus of little political import and is often ignored by Cameroonian politicians. This coupled with the low level of development in the province have led to its being dubbed "the forgotten province".

CATEGORIES: Censorship of broadcasting in the United Kingdom

The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) was an NGO which until December 31, 2007 pre-approved most British television advertising. The work of the BACC has been taken over by Clearcast Ltd.
BACC approval was applied both to scripts and to the final commercials. The BACC applied a list of criteria which included both good taste and decency criteria, and also a variety of technical and even medical constraints (advertisements may not, for example, contain flashing which would set off attacks of photosensitive epilepsy).
The BACC was a department of ITV but funded by all of the participating British commercial television channels, in proportion to their viewing figures.
All TV commercials in the UK which were broadcast as part of a national campaign (i.e. on a national channel such as Channel 4, five, Sky etc.) had to be pre-approved by the BACC.

pngcrush is a free, open source command-line utility for optimizing PNG image files. It reduces the size of the file losslessly — that is, the resulting "crushed" image will have the same quality as the source image.
The main purpose of pngcrush is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT datastream by trying various combinations of compression methods and delta filters. However, pngcrush can also be used for various manipulations of PNG images, such as changing the bit depth, removing unwanted ancillary chunks, or adding certain chunks including gAMA, tRNS, iCCP, and textual chunks.

[[Melbourne Kestrels]]

CATEGORIES: Australian netball teams, Sporting clubs in Melbourne

The Melbourne Kestrels were an Australian netball team. They were based out of the State Netball and Hockey Centre in Melbourne, Victoria and were one of two teams from the city to compete in the national Commonwealth Bank Trophy, alongside the Melbourne Phoenix. The Kestrels were coached by Jane Searle and co-captained by Rebecca Bulley and Chelsey Tregear (then Nash). Their colours are orange, blue and lime.
The Kestrels were one of the Commonwealth Bank Trophy's founding teams in 1997, and initially played at the Waverley Netball Centre. They moved to the then-new, much larger State Netball and Hockey Centre as their main home in 2001, but returned to Waverley for some home games in 2006. The club's major sponsor is Allied Pickfords.
Though the Kestrels had made the finals several times, they never played in a grand final, and were often been seen as a lesser cousin of the rival Melbourne Phoenix. The rivalry between the two clubs was exacerbated by the shock defection of Kestrels captain Cynna Kydd to the Phoenix in April 2006, on the eve of the 2006 season, echoing the move of Janine Ilitch from Phoenix to Kestrels years ago. However the loss of Kydd was balanced by the emergence of Caitlin Thwaites, a young former elite volleyball player, as a promising shooter.  
The Kestrels merged with the Melbourne Phoenix in 2008 due to the new trans Tasman trophy, the ANZ Championship. This meant only twelve players from the Phoenix and the Kestrels were chosen for the 2008 squad, leaving less chance for the younger players of both teams to develop as players at an elite level.  The remaining players forged together to become the Melbourne Vixens.

[[Dominant ideology]]

CATEGORIES: Conformity, Marxist theory, Postmodern terminology

The dominant ideology denotes the values, beliefs, and mores shared by the majority of the people in a given society; the dominant ideology frames how the majority of the population think about the nature of their society.
According to Marxist theory, the dominant ideology is used to serve the interests of the ruling class. Hence the slogan: The dominant ideology is the ideology of the dominant class summarises its function as a revolutionary basis.[tpl]cite web |title=The Dominant Ideology Thesis|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/589886?uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21100813983551|publisher=The British Journal of Sociology|accessdate=21 May 2012|authors=Nicholas Abercrombie and Bryan S. Turner|date=June 1978[/tpl]  In a capitalist, bourgeois society, Marxist revolutionary praxis seeks to achieve the social and political circumstances that will render the ruling class as politically illegitimate, as such, it is requisite for the successful deposition of the capitalist system of production. Then, the ideology of the working class will achieve and establish social, political, and economic dominance, so that the proletariat (the urban working class and the peasantry) can assume power (political and economic) as the dominant class of the society.
In non-Marxist theory, the dominant ideology means the values, beliefs, and morals shared by the social majority, which frames how most of the populace think about their society, and so, to the extent that it does, it may serve the interests of the ruling class; therefore, the extent to which a dominant ideology effectively dominates collective societal thought has declined during the modern era.[tpl]Cite journal |title= The Dominant Ideology Thesis |first= Nicholas |last= Abercrombie |first2= Bryan S. |last2= Turner |journal= The British Journal of Sociology |volume= 29 |issue= 2 |date= June 1978 |pages= 149–70 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |location= The London School of Economics and Political Science |url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/589886 |accessdate= September 17, 2012[/tpl]

[[HMS Royal Charles (1655)]]
CATEGORIES: Ships of the line of the Royal Navy, 1650s ships, Captured ships

Royal Charles was an 80-gun first-rate three-decker ship of the line of the English Navy.  She was originally called the Naseby, built by Peter Pett, and launched at Woolwich dockyard in 1655, for the navy of the Commonwealth of England, and named in honour of Sir Thomas Fairfax's decisive 1645 victory over the Royalist forces during the English Civil Wars. She was ordered in 1654 as one of a programme of four second rates, intended to carry 60 guns each. However, she was altered during construction to mount a complete battery of guns along the upper deck (compared with the partial battery on this deck of her intended sisters, on which there were no gunports in the waist along this deck), and so was reclassed as a first rate.
In the run-up to the Restoration of the monarchy during June 1660 she was anchored in The Downs off Deal, where her laurel-crowned figurehead of Oliver Cromwell was removed before sailing to the Dutch Republic at the head of the fleet sent to bring King Charles II back to England, captained by Sir Edward Montagu and still under her Parliamentary name.Parliamentary Intelligencer, April 30th to May 7th 1660, in Random Edition On arrival in Scheveningen she was renamed HMS ''Royal Charles'' and took Charles and his entourage (including Samuel Pepys) on board, landing them at Dover.
Under her new name, she thus joined the Royal Navy which formally came into being in 1660. At 1,229 tons, Naseby was larger than [tpl]HMS|Sovereign of the Seas||2[/tpl], the first three-deck ship of the line, built by Phineas Pett, Peter's father. Unlike Sovereign of the Seas, which was in service from 1637 to 1697, Naseby was to enjoy only twelve years in service.
As Royal Charles she took part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1665 she fought in the Battle of Lowestoft under the command of the Lord High Admiral, James Stuart, Duke of York, her captain being Sir William Penn. During that battle she probably destroyed the Dutch flagship Eendracht. In 1666 she participated in two further actions, the Four Days Battle and the defeat of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in the St. James's Day Battle off the North Foreland.
In 1667, flagging English national morale was further depressed by the raid on the Medway in which a Dutch fleet invaded the Thames and Medway rivers and on 12 June captured the uncommissioned Royal Charles, removing her with great skill to Hellevoetsluis in the United Provinces. The Dutch did not take her into naval service because it was considered that she drew too much water for general use on the Dutch coast. She was auctioned for scrap in 1673.
Her metal stern piece, showing the English coat of arms with a lion and unicorn) along with her white ensign, is now on display in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

While mixing the meta-data with the data could be done it makes the whole confusing. In this pattern the meta-data or meta-information are structured as the header, sometimes known as the envelope. The ordinary data or information are structured as the body, sometimes known as the payload. XML is employed for both head and body (see also XML Protocol).

Planica is an alpine valley in northwestern Slovenia, extending south from the border village of Rateče, not far from another well-known ski resort, Kranjska Gora. Further south, the valley extends into the Tamar Valley, a popular hiking destination in Triglav National Park.
Planica is famous for ski jumping. The first ski jumping hill was constructed before 1930 at the slope of Mount Ponca. In 1934, Stanko Bloudek built a larger hill, known as the "Bloudek Giant". The first ski jump over 100 m was achieved here in 1936 by the Austrian Sepp Bradl. At the time, this was the biggest jumping hill in the world, sometimes called "the mother of all jumping hills."[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] 
In 1969, a new K-185 hill, Letalnica bratov Gorišek, was built by Lado and Janez Gorišek. Between 1985, when Matti Nykänen flew 191 m, and 2011, new world records have always been set at Planica rather than any other ski jumping hill (e.g., Kulm in Austria, Harrachov in the Czech Republic, Oberstdorf in Germany, or Vikersundbakken in Norway). After its 2010 rebuilding, Vikersundbakken is the biggest hill in the world, and the current world record is set there.
In 1994, Toni Nieminen of Finland was the first ski jumper in history to jump over 200 m. The hill record is 239 m, set by Bjørn Einar Romøren of Norway in March 2005, which at the time was a world record.
The ski jumping infrastructure was recently completely renovated and the old K-130 hill was rebuilt. After the 2012/13 season is finished, works wills start on the K-185 hill making it the biggest ski jumping hill in the world once again. The first two hills have been completed.http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Articles/0110-New+ski+jumps+in+Planica+ready%21

The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Table, or Tabula Smaragdina, is a compact and cryptic piece of Hermetica reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia and its transmutation. It was highly regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art and its Hermetic tradition. Although Hermes Trismegistus is the author named in the text, the first known appearance of the Emerald Tablet is in a book written in Arabic between the sixth and eighth centuries. The text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century. Numerous translations, interpretations and commentaries followed.
The location and source of the original tablet or document are unknown.

It is native to warm subtropical to tropical eastern Asia, from Japan and China south to Indonesia. It is a perennial plant, growing from a large corm up to 25 cm in diameter. The single leaf is up to 1.3 m across, bipinnate, and divided into numerous leaflets. The flowers are produced on a spathe enclosed by a dark purple spadix up to 55 cm long.
The food made from the root of this plant is widely known in English by its Japanese name, konnyaku (yam cake), being cooked and consumed primarily in Japan. The two basic types of cake are white and black. Pushing the cake through a grid of sharp blades at the end of a wooden box gives noodles, called shirataki, which are also sold in white and black colors.
The corm of the konjac is often colloquially referred to as a yam, although it bears no marked relation to tubers of the family Dioscoreaceae.

The socialist market economy is the economic model employed by the People's Republic of China. It is based on the dominance of the state-owned sector and an open-market economy, and has its origins in the Chinese economic reforms introduced under Deng Xiaoping. The ideological rationale is that China is in the primary stage of socialism, an early stage within the socialist mode of production, and therefore has to adapt capitalist techniques to thrive. Despite this, the system has been widely been cited as a form of state capitalism.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21543160 | work=The Economist | title=The rise of state capitalism | date=21 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1= Bremmer|first1= Ian|year= 2009|title= State Capitalism Comes of Age |journal= Foreign Affairs|volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= Council on Foreign Relations|url= |accessdate=9 December 2012[/tpl]

[[Four Bucketeers]]

CATEGORIES: English pop music groups

The Four Bucketeers were an ad-hoc music/water-throwing group from the ITV children's programme Tiswas.
Officially, the Four were Chris Tarrant, Sally James, John Gorman and Bob Carolgees; sometimes Lenny Henry contributed as well. Gorman was the musical talent in the group, having been part of The Scaffold and the Grimms. The musicians backing them up included Ollie Halsall (guitar), John Halsey (drums) and Clive Griffiths (bass).  
The Four Bucketeers' best-known number (and also their highest-charting single) was "Bucket Of Water Song", which reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980.
Originally the song was composed and performed as a sketch within the Tiswas programme. According to Sally James, "John came in one day and he said ‘I’ve sort of got this idea’. It’s a march basically, and we all sing this song. And it’s another excuse to chuck buckets of water! So obviously we didn’t do it in the studio. We had this little area outside the back of the studio where a camera would sort of poke out of the window, so we ended the show down there marching about, sploshing all this water from the buckets. And then the next week it was incredible, because the people were jamming the switchboard, ‘I’ve got to have this record!’. There was never any idea that it would be a record, but of course we did quickly make a record and it became a hit. It just all happened so left-of-field and so unplanned…but then that’s how a lot of things did happen in Tiswas. Things that you think would work, don’t, and things that you ‘Oh that’ll be good for a one-off’ end up being huge hits".[ref]
</ref>
The moniker 'The Four Bucketeers' came about as a way of circumnavigating any potential copyright difficulties of using the 'Tiswas' brand when Tarrant and Co. performed the song outside of the TV show situation, and the initial record release. Ultimately though, a compromise was reached and thereafter, the phrase 'Tiswas presents The Four Bucketeers' was used.
The aquatic theme was carried through into a less successful follow-up single, the anthemic waltz-time "Water Is Wonderful", which eulogised:
An album, entitled Tiswas Presents The Four Bucketeers, was also released. This included both singles (albeit a different version of "Water Is Wonderful") together with other skits from the television series. Contrary to the impression given by the singles, these were not all concerned with pailborne aquatic antics. All of The Four Bucketeers' records were produced by Neil Innes.
A third single was released from the album featuring Matthew Butler (the 6 year old who dressed as a rabbit) singing "Bright Eyes".

José Arce (15 October 1881 – 27 July 1968) was an Argentine physician, politician and diplomat. He held the position of the President of the United Nations General Assembly during the Second special session of the United Nations General Assembly - between 16 April 1948 and 21 September 1948.
Arce was born at the Estancia 'La Independencia' in Lobería and was baptised at Balcarce. At just fifteen he began studying at the Medicine Faculty of the University of Buenos Aires, from which he graduated as a doctor in 1903 with the gold medal for his class. He became a surgeon and professor of Anatomy at the University at just 25 years old. He also was professor of Surgery and represented the country in 1907 at the Latin American Medical Congress in Montevideo.
In 1909, Arce entered politics, becoming a city legislator of Buenos Aires until 1913, serving as chairman in 1912. Continuing his medical career, he was President of the Medical Society of Argentina in 1911. In 1913, Arce was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, serving from 1913 to 1920, 1924 to 1928 and 1934 to 1938, representing Buenos Aires Province. He proposed the law creating the Faculty of Economics of UBA. He was Rector of UBA from 1922 to 1926. In 1926, now President of the Chamber of Deputies, he moved the law that created the current building for the Faculty of Medicine.
In 1945, Arce became Ambassador to Shanghai, and he was the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the UN for the period 1946-1949, during which time Argentina was a member of the Security Council 1948-49 and Arce was the President of the 1948 Special Session held in Paris, regarding the situation in Palestine. As a postage stamp collector Arce proposed that the United Nations should also issue them, an idea that was followed through in 1951 when the United Nations Postal Administration was created.
During the government of Juan Perón, he left for exile in Madrid and the United States. He wrote several books including a three-volume autobiography, a book dedicated to Francisco Franco and a manifesto for the return of the Falkland Islands to Argentine control.
Arce had one daughter, who died aged 14 in Paris in 1922. Some days later, he donated his books to the faculty library which was named 'María Antonieta Arce' in his daughter's memory. He donated his house in Buenos Aires to become a museum dedicated to President Julio Roca. He received many honours from universities and governments across the world.

The Seven Grievances (Manchu: 20px nadan koro; [tpl]zh|c=七大恨|p=Qī Dà Hèn[/tpl]) was a manifesto announced by Nurhaci on the Thirteenth day of the Fourth lunar month in the Third year of Tianming ([tpl]zh|c=天命[/tpl]) era (7 May 1618http://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/). It effectively declared war against the Ming Dynasty.

After the announcement of the Seven Grievances, Manchu troops forced their way into Fushun and obtained the surrender of the city's commander Li Yongfang (d. 1634). In retaliation, a year later, a Ming punitive force of about 100,000 men, which included Korean and Yehe troops, approached Nurhaci's Manchus along four different routes. The Manchus scored successive victories, the most famous one[tpl]By whom|date=July 2011[/tpl] near the town of Sarhu. The Míng Dynasty was wearied by a combination of internal strife and constant harassment by the Manchu. On May 26, 1644, Beijing fell to a peasant rebel army led by Li Zicheng. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City. The Manchus then allied with Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun Dynasty.

[[Count Claude Florimond de Mercy]]

CATEGORIES: 1666 births, 1734 deaths, People from Longwy, Counts of Austria, Austrian Field Marshals, Austrian army commanders in the War of the Spanish Succession, People of the War of the Polish Succession

Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy (1666 in Longwy – 1734 in Parma) was an Imperial field marshal, born at Longwy in Lorraine, now in France.
Mercy entered the Austrian army as a volunteer in 1682. He won his commission at the great Battle of Vienna in the following year; and during seven years of campaigning in Hungary rose to the rank of Rittmeister. A wound sustained at this time permanently injured his sight. For five years more, up to 1697, he was employed in the Italian campaigns, then he was called back to Hungary by Prince Eugene of Savoy and won on the field of the Battle of Zenta two grades of promotion.
De Mercy displayed great daring in the first campaigns of the Spanish Succession War in Italy, twice fell into the hands of the enemy in rights at close quarters and for his conduct at the surprise of Cremona (31 January 1702) received the thanks of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and the proprietary colonelcy of a newly raised cuirassier regiment. With this he took part in the Rhine campaign of 1703, and the Battle of Friedlingen, and his success as an intrepid leader of raids and forays became well known to friend and foe. He was on that account selected early in 1704 to harry the dominions of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. He was soon afterwards promoted to Generalfeldwachtmeister, in which rank he was engaged in the Battle of Schellenberg (2 July 1704).
In the rest of the war he was often distinguished by his fiery courage. He rose to be general of cavalry in the course of these ten years. His resolute leadership was conspicuous at the Battle of Peterwardein (1716) and he was soon afterwards made commander of the Banat of Temesvar.
At the great Battle of Belgrade (1717) he led the second line of left wing cavalry in a brilliant and decisive charge which drove the forces of the Ottoman Empire to their trenches. After the peace he resumed the administration of the Banat, which after more than 150 years of Turkish rule needed a capable governor. But before his work was done he was once more called away to a command in the field, this time in southern Italy, where he fought the Battle of Francavilla (20 June 1719), took Messina and besieged Palermo. For eleven years more he administered the Banat, reorganizing the country as a prosperous and civilized community.
In 1733 he was made a general field marshal in the army and in the Spring of that year he and the Irish-born Major General Baron Francis Patrick O'Neillan assembled 50,000 men at Mantua in an effort to reclaim all that had been lost the previous year when the Austrians had been driven from Italy by the Franco-Spanish forces.  Mercy was killed on 29 June at the Battle of Parma while personally leading his troops. He left no children, and his name passed to Count Argenteau, from whom came the family of Mercy-Argenteau.
He was the foster father of Florimund Count de Mercy d'Argenteau, and his great-uncle was Franz Freiherr von Mercy.
On 3 August 2009 a bust of the count was unveiled in Central Park, Timişoara.[tpl]Ro[/tpl] Anca Toma, Diplome, apartamente şi hectolitri de bere, de Ziua Timişoarei, Renaşterea Bănăţeană, 2009-08-04

The Dukedom of Inverness was a title in the Jacobite Peerage of Great Britain, and as such was not recognised by the government or monarch or Great Britain.  Its only holder was John Hay of Cromlix.
Lady Cecilia Underwood was the second wife of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the sixth son of King George III; however, their marriage was deemed illegal because of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, so Cecilia was never recognized as Duchess of Sussex or a British princess. Instead, Queen Victoria later created Cecilia Duchess of Inverness for life.

Active Measures ([tpl]lang-ru|Активные мероприятия[/tpl]) was a form of political warfare conducted by the Soviet security services (Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, KGB) to influence the course of world events, "in addition to collecting intelligence and producing politically correct assessment of it".Mitrokhin, Vasili, Christopher Andrew (2000). The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Gardners Books. ISBN 0-14-028487-7. Active measures ranged "from media manipulations to special actions involving various degrees of violence". They were used both abroad and domestically. They included disinformation, propaganda, counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration in churches, and persecution of political dissidents.
Active measures included the establishment and support of international front organizations (e.g. the World Peace Council); foreign communist, socialist and opposition parties; wars of national liberation in the Third World; and underground, revolutionary, insurgency, criminal, and terrorist groups. The intelligence agencies of Eastern Bloc states also contributed to the program, providing operatives and intelligence for assassinations and other types of covert operations.
Retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin described active measures as "the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence": "Not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs."Interview of Oleg Kalugin on CNN
Active measures was a system of special courses taught in the Andropov Institute of KGB situated at SVR headquarters in Yasenevo, near Moscow. The head of the "active measures department" was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge Five spy ring.

[[Polyphaga]]

CATEGORIES: Beetles, Polyphaga

Polyphaga is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles; the name is derived from two Greek words: poly-, meaning 'many', and phagein, meaning 'to eat', so the suborder is called the “eaters of many things”. Polyphaga comprises 144 families in 16 superfamilies, and displays an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation, with over 300,000 described species, or approximately 90% of the beetle species so far discovered.
Key characteristics of Polyphaga are that the hind coxa (base of the leg), does not divide the first and second abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present.[tpl]cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Norman F. |last2=Triplehorn |first2=Charles A. |title=Borror and DeLong's Introduction to the Study of Insects |edition=7th |year=2004 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=0-03-096835-6 |pages=365–400, 428–429[/tpl]

There are roughly 400 surviving orthodox inscriptions on stone monuments throughout Ireland and western Britain; the bulk of them are in the south of Ireland, in Counties Kerry, Cork and Waterford.[ref]McManus (1991) is aware of a total of 382 orthodox inscriptions. The later scholastic inscriptions have no definite endpoint and continue into the Middle Irish and even Modern Irish period, and record also names in other languages, such as Old Norse, (Old) Welsh, Latin and possibly Pictish.

The vast majority of the inscriptions consist of personal names.
Ogham is sometimes called the "Celtic Tree Alphabet", based on a high medieval Bríatharogam tradition ascribing names of trees to the individual letters.
The etymology of the word ogam or ogham remains unclear. One possible origin is from the Irish og-úaim 'point-seam', referring to the seam made by the point of a sharp weapon.(MacManus, §8.6)

Sussex's second wife (whom he married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act of 1772) was given the title of Duchess of Inverness, which became extinct upon her death in 1873.
The next creation was for Prince George, second son of Edward VII, as a subsidiary title along with the Dukedom of York. As the Prince became King in 1910, succeeding his father, his titles merged in the crown.
The title was created again in 1920 as a subsidiary title of Prince Albert, second son of George V, who was also created Duke of York at the same time.  The title merged in the crown when York succeeded his brother in 1936 to become King George VI.
The title was created a fourth time in 1986 as a subsidiary title for Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York.

Theoren Wallace "Theo" Fleury (born June 29, 1968) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, New York Rangers, and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), Tappara of Finland's SM-liiga, and the Belfast Giants of the UK's Elite Ice Hockey League. He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, and played over 1,000 games in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.  
One of the smallest players of his generation, Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations. As a junior, he was at the centre of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany, a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size, Fleury scored over 1,000 points in his career and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames. He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics, winning a gold medal in 2002. Throughout his career, he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003. He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005–06, and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup. After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames, he retired in 2009.
Outside of hockey, Fleury overcame his addictions, operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family, and filmed a pilot for a reality television show based around it. He marketed his own brand of clothing, which led him to play two professional baseball games for the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League. In 1995, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $1 million for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada. 
Fleury co-wrote Playing with Fire, a best-selling autobiography released in October 2009, in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach Graham James. Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James, who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault.  Fleury has since become an advocate for sexual abuse victims and developed a career as a public speaker.

A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given G and H. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\G/H can be taken to be a compact space, called a compact Clifford–Klein form.  
When H is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.

 ''The Aesthetics of Rock''  is a book by Richard Meltzer (born May 10, 1945). Written between 1965 and 1968, it was published in 1970. Da Capo Press in 1987 published an unabridged edition with a new foreword by Meltzer. It is one of the first major works of rock-music criticism and analysis. He wrote it as an undergraduate at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and as a graduate student at Yale University, from which he was, as he relates in his foreword, "kicked out toot-sweet on my rock-roll caboose" for writing papers with rock-music themes for philosophy classes. 
Writer Greil Marcus, in his introduction to the Da Capo edition of Aesthetics, maintains that the book is "the best and most obsessive book about the Beatles ever written," and that the work seeks to illuminate "the collapse of art into everyday life, and vice versa."

This nature preserve represents the northernmost extension of some southern species, such as bigleaf magnolia (Magnolia macrophylla) and umbrella magnolia (Magnolia tripetala), but also includes more northerly species such as wolf-foot clubmoss (Lycopodium clavatum).
The preserve features three principal trails, the one-mile Calico Bush Trail, the two-mile Salt Creek Trail, and the 2.5-mile Pine Ridge Trail.  Boating is allowed on the lake by written permit only.  The western portion of the preserve is off-limits to visitors, and is reserved for scientific research.

Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP, also known as anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura)[tpl]cite book |author=Rapini RP, Bolognia JL, Jorizzo JL |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0[/tpl] is a disease of the skin and other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small hemorrhages); often with joint and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, there may be a loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine, but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.
HSP is a systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and is characterized by deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody IgA; the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. It usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of the cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases.

To tea bag is a slang term for the sexual act of a man placing his scrotum in the mouth of a willing sexual partner for pleasure or onto the face or head of another person. The name of the practice, when it is done in a repeated in-and-out motion, is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a tea bag into a cup of hot water as a method of brewing tea. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay.

[[Militia Act of 1855]]

CATEGORIES: Military history of Canada, Province of Canada legislation

The Militia Act of 1855, an act of Canadian legislation, permitted the formation of an Active Militia.  The 5,000 volunteers were armed, equipped and paid 5 shillings a day for 10 days of training a year (20 days for those in the artillery). Captains were paid 10 shillings 6 pence a day.
Initially set at 5,000 men, the Act's popularity forced the government to double its size to 10,000 men by 1856. Trained at the expense of taxpayers, the men had to provide their own uniforms.
The Act divided Canada into 18 military districts. Assisted by volunteer staff officers, each district was commanded by a colonel, while the entire operation was led by Colonel E.P. Taché. 
Enthusiasm for the Act waned by 1858 when economic depression occupied the minds of Canadians. In 1860, military spirit was revived by the royal visit of the Prince of Wales. Canadians, Nova Scotians, and New Bruswickers launched their own volunteer units. These companies began to form into battalions that gradually eclipsed the Sedentary Militia. In 1864, the Sedentary Militia was re-styled "Non-Service Militia", and in 1869, its battalions were reduced to the "Reserve Militia" of each county. The Reserve Militia was last enrolled in 1873 (but never called out), deferred thereafter, and the theory that every able-bodied man was liable for service was finally abolished in 1950.

XXXV. 1 Stat. 553 from "A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation:  U. S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875". Library of Congress, Law Library of Congress. Retrieved March 24, 2012. The Department of the Navy was an Executive Department and the Secretary of the Navy was a member of the President's cabinet until 1949, when amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 changed the name of the National Military Establishment to the Department of Defense and made it an Executive Department. The Department of the Navy then became, along with the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force, a Military Department within the Department of Defense: subject to the authority, direction and control of the Secretary of Defense.

Hawk Woods is an old-growth forest located in central Athens County, Ohio, outside the city of Athens, Ohio. It comprises 106 acres (about 43 hectares) "within the Low Hills Belt section of the Allegheny Plateau".  Of these 106 acres, about 85 acres (34 hectares) are in the area cited as old-growth forest. Adjacent to Strouds Run State Park, the woods now comprise a state nature preserve named the Dale & Jackie Riddle State Nature Preserve.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ohiodnr.gov/location/dnap/riddle/tabid/958/Default.aspx| title= Dale & Jackie Riddle State Nature Preserve| publisher = Ohio Department of Natural Resources| accessdate  = February 27, 2011[/tpl]
The preserve is owned and managed by the City of Athens.  This Ohio public land was dedicated as a state nature preserve, in part because the Ohio Division of Natural Areas and Preserves donated $50,000 to the purchase price.  The property was purchased for $550,000.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E-FIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y4IMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3990,7481337|newspaper=The Vindicator |date=May 26, 2003| title=City buys land, saving and old-growth forest|agency=Associated Press|page=B5|location=Youngstown, Ohio|accessdate=2011-02-27[/tpl]  The preserve is part of the city's east-side Strouds Ridge Preserve project, which to date includes about 325 acres (about 132 hectares) total.
As with many other areas in southeast Ohio, the preserve suffers from white-tail deer overpopulation.  A deer exclosure was built to demonstrate the effects of grazing pressure from the deer.
The preserve is known to harbor the relatively rare gametophytic fern species, Trichomanes intricatum.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

[[Alectryomancy]]

CATEGORIES: Divination

Alectryomancy (also called alectoromancy or alectromancy, derivation comes from the Greek words alectryon and manteia, which mean rooster and divination respectively) is a form of divination in which the diviner observes a bird, several birds, or most preferably a white rooster or cockerel pecking at grain (such as wheat) that the diviner has scattered on the ground. It was the responsibility of the pullularius to feed and keep the birds used. The observer may place grain in the shape of letters and thus discern a divinatory revelation by noting which letters the birds peck at, or the diviner may just interpret the pattern left by the birds' pecking in randomly scattered grain.
In another version, the observer tethers the bird in the center of a circle, around the perimeter of which is marked the alphabet, with a piece of grain at each letter. For each grain the bird pecks, the observer writes down the letter which that grain represents. The observer also replaces each grain as the bird eats it, so that letters may be repeated. The sequence of letters recorded will presumably contain a message.
This form of divination is related to Ouija, by the random selection of letters; and gyromancy by the random selection of letters from a circle around the diviner himself; and to orniscopy, divination by the movements of birds.
Alectormancy is also sacrificing a sacred rooster. The use of the sacred rooster through alectryomancy may be further understood within that religious character and likewise defined as the cockfight or cockfightingEncyclopaedia Perthensis; or Universal dictionary of the arts, sciences, literature, &c. intended to supersede the use of other books of reference, Volume 1 - Printed by John Brown, 1816 http://books.google.com/books?id=vvVPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA394&lpg=PA394&dq=Alectryomancy+cockfight&source=bl&ots=SIaoyDrXYA&sig=oelfp0KzDKF09rNXN9p8ilP5FuI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uwLKT5v5NISQ8wS32byXDw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Alectryomancy%20cockfight&f=false with the intent of communication between the gods and man.

Paul Jules Antoine Meillet ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɑ̃twan mɛjɛ|lang[/tpl]; November 11, 1866, Moulins, Allier – September 21, 1936, Châteaumeillant) was one of the most important French linguists of the early 20th century. Meillet began his studies at the Sorbonne, where he was influenced by Michel Bréal, Ferdinand de Saussure, and the members of the Année Sociologique. In 1890 he was part of a research trip to the Caucasus, where he studied Armenian. After his return, since de Saussure had gone back to Geneva, he continued the series of lectures on comparative grammar that the Swiss linguist had formerly given.
Meillet completed his doctorate, Research on the Use of the Genitive-Accusative in Old Slavonic, in 1897. In 1902 he took a chair in Armenian at the École des langues orientales. In 1905 he was elected to the Collège de France, where he taught on the history and structure of Indo-European languages. He worked closely with noted linguists Paul Pelliot and Robert Gauthiot. 
Today Meillet is remembered as the mentor of an entire generation of linguists and philologists who would become central to French linguistics in the twentieth century, such as Émile Benveniste, Georges Dumézil, and André Martinet.

Olympia is a 1938 film by Leni Riefenstahl documenting the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany. The film was released in two parts: Olympia 1. Teil — Fest der Völker (Festival of Nations) and Olympia 2. Teil — Fest der Schönheit (Festival of Beauty). It was the first documentary feature film of the Olympic Games ever made. Many advanced motion picture techniques, which later became industry standards but which were groundbreaking at the time, were employed —including unusual camera angles, smash cuts, extreme close-ups, placing tracking shot rails within the bleachers, and the like. The techniques employed are almost universally admired, but the film is controversial due to its political context. Nevertheless, the film appears on many lists of the greatest films of all-time, including Time magazine's "All-Time 100 Movies."
Olympia set the precedent for future films documenting and glorifying the Olympic Games, particularly the Summer Games. The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was devised by the German sports official Dr. Carl Diem for these Olympic Games in Berlin. Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for this film, as with competitive events of the Games.

[[Naval fleet]]

CATEGORIES: Naval fleets, Naval ships, Naval units and formations

A fleet or naval fleet is a large formation of warships, and the largest formation in any navy. A fleet at sea is the direct equivalent of an army on land. 
Fleets are usually, but not necessarily, permanent formations and are generally assigned to a particular ocean or sea. Most fleets are named after that ocean or sea, but the convention in the United States Navy is to use numbers. 
A fleet is normally commanded by an Admiral, who is often also a commander in chief, but many fleets have been or are commanded by Vice Admirals or even Rear Admirals. Most fleets are divided into several squadrons, each under a subordinate admiral. Those squadrons in turn are often divided into divisions. In the age of sail, fleets were divided into van, centre and rear squadrons, named after each squadron’s place in the line of battle. In more modern times, the squadrons are typically composed of homogeneous groups of the same class of warship, such as battleships or cruisers. 
Since many smaller navies only contain a single fleet, the term the fleet is often synonymous with the navy.
Multinational fleets are not uncommon in naval history. For example, several nations made up the Holy League fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. In modern times, NATO has formed standing combined fleets and operations from several national navies such as Operation Active Endeavour.

CATEGORIES: Collège de France faculty, University of Paris alumni, Linguists from France, Members of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, Indo-Europeanists, Structuralism, 1902 births, 1976 deaths, Sephardi Jews

Émile Benveniste ([tpl]IPA-fr|bɛnvənist|lang[/tpl]; 27 May 1902 – 3 October 1976) was a French structural linguist and semiotician.
He is best known for his work on Indo-European languages and his expansion of the linguistic paradigm established by Ferdinand de Saussure. Initially studying under Antoine Meillet, a former student of Saussure, at the Sorbonne, he began teaching at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and was elected to the Collège de France a decade later in 1937 as professor of linguistics. By this time he had already begun his investigation into the status of names within the history of Indo-European linguistic forms. He held his seat at the Collège de France until 1969 when he retired due to deteriorating health. However, he served as the first President of the International Association for Semiotic Studies from 1969 to 1972.
Benveniste was born in Aleppo, Aleppo Vilayet, Ottoman Syria.  At the start of his career, his highly specialised and technical work limited his influence to a small circle of scholars.  The publication of his monumental text, Problèmes de linguistique générale or Problems in General Linguistics, would elevate his position to much wider recognition.  The two volumes of this work appeared in 1966 and 1974 respectively.  The book exhibits not only scientific rigour but also a lucid style accessible to the layman, consisting of various writings culled from a period of more than twenty-five years.  In Chapter 5, Animal Communication and Human Language, Benveniste refutes behaviourist linguistic interpretations by demonstrating that human speech, unlike the so-called languages of bees and other animals, cannot be merely reduced to a stimulus-response system.
The I–you polarity is another important development explored in the text.  The third person acts under the conditions of possibility of this polarity between the first and second persons.  Narration and description illustrate this.
You, on the other hand, is defined in this way:
A pivotal concept in Benveniste's work is the distinction between the énoncé and the énonciation, which grew out of his study on pronouns.  The énoncé is the statement independent of context, whereas the énonciation is the act of stating as tied to context.  In essence, this distinction moved Benveniste to see language itself as a "discursive instance" — fundamentally as discourse.  This discourse is, in turn, the actual utilisation, the very enactment, of language.
One of the founders of structuralism, Roland Barthes, attended Benveniste's seminars at École Pratique. Pierre Bourdieu was instrumental in publishing  Benveniste's other masterpiece, Vocabulaire des Institutions Indo-Européennes  in his series Le Sens Commun at radical publisher Les Éditions de Minuit (1969). The title is deceiving: It is not a "vocabulary" but a comprehensive and comparative analysis of key social behaviors and institutions across Germanic, Romanesque, Greek and Roman, Old Iranian and Indian cultures, using the words ("vocables") that denote them as points of entry. It hovers over philology, anthropology, phenomenology and sociology. A number of contemporary French philosophers  often refer to Benveniste's Vocabulaire and are inspired by his methodology and distinction between signification and designation (Barbara Cassin, Nicole Loraux, Philippe-Joseph Salazar, François Jullien, Marc Crépon). Jacques Derrida's famous work on "hospitality, the Other, the enemy" is an explicit "gloss" on Benveniste's ground-breaking study of host/hostility/hospitality in the Vocabulary (Chapter 7) (Jacques Derrida, On Hospitality, 2000).
Benveniste died in Paris, aged 74.

Frank Hamilton Newcomb (10 November 1846 - 20 February 1934) was a Commodore in the United States Revenue Cutter Service.  Commodore Newcomb was most famous for his heroic actions at the Battle of Cárdenas during the Spanish-American War.
Newcomb was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Before joining the Revenue Cutter Service, he served in the Navy from 1863 to 1865.
At the time the Spanish-American War broke out, First Lieutenant Frank Newcomb was in command of the USRC Hudson, which then entered the war as a U.S. Navy auxiliary.  Hudson had been retrofitted with two six-pounders and a small machine gun, but was more of a tugboat than a combat vessel.
On May 11, 1898, in one of the first actions off the coast of Cuba, Newcomb distinguished himself and his ship in the Battle of Cardenas. The U.S. Navy torpedo boat [tpl]USS|Winslow|TB-5|6[/tpl] and the USRC Hudson had been shelling Spanish positions. Winslow had been hit multiple times. Half her complement was dead and her captain gravely wounded.
Newcomb ordered Hudson to tow Winslow out of harms way.  Under heavy fire, she did just that, despite nearly foundering on shoals trying to fast a line to Hudson. Newcomb's actions saved USS Winslow from destruction and possible capture.
Three members of Winslow 's crew received medals for their actions. Because of the Revenue Cutter Service's status at the time, President William McKinley felt that Newcomb could not be nominated for a Medal of Honor as he was a Revenue Cutter Service officer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Instead, Congress instructed that a Gold Medal be struck for First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb on May 3, 1900 in 31 Stat. 716 (56th Congress). At the time, it was thought to be an honor equivalent to the Medal of Honor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] His officers were awarded silver medals, and the crew bronze.
Commodore Newcomb died in Los Angeles, California.  He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife, Rose Prioleau Newcomb.  
The United States Navy destroyer USS Newcomb (DD-586) was named in his honor.

Congratulations I'm Sorry (typeset as Congratulations...I'm Sorry) is the third studio album by the American pop rock band Gin Blossoms, and the follow-up album to the successful 1992 release New Miserable Experience, released in 1996 by A&M records. The album was named in reference to the success of 1992's New Miserable Experience, followed so closely by the suicide of the former band member Doug Hopkins in 1993.
Reaction to Congratulations I'm Sorry was mixed, with some critics feeling that the music lay too close to the sound of the previous album.  One common complaint was that the album lacked the successful 1995 single "Til I Hear It From You" from the Empire Records soundtrack. However, some editions of the album did contain the track. The album's title, according to the lead singer Robin Wilson, came from the response band members usually received from people who both wanted to congratulate the band for the success of New Miserable Experience, while then offering apologies for their friend and former band member Doug Hopkins. The album eventually reached platinum status.

The Laie Hawaii Temple was the first temple built by the LDS Church outside of the continental United States.  The temple is also the oldest to operate outside of Utah, and the fifth-oldest LDS temple still in operation.  In addition to initial building and construction, the temple has been dedicated for use by several presidents of the LDS Church.  This includes the site of the temple being dedicated by Joseph F. Smith on June 1, 1915, the completed structure being dedicated by Heber J. Grant on November 27, 1919, being rededicated after significant expansion  on June 13, 1978 by Spencer W. Kimball and then rededicated on November 21, 2010 by Thomas S. Monson following seismic upgrades and remodeling. The Laie Hawaii Temple was formerly known as the Hawaiian Temple or the Hawaii Temple until a standard naming convention for LDS temples was announced in 1999.[tpl]cite news |title= Temples renamed to uniform guidelines |url= http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/36633/Temples-renamed-to-uniform-guidelines.html |newspaper= Church News |date= October 16, 1999 |publisher= Deseret News |accessdate= 2012-10-10 [/tpl]

Diogo Álvares Correia (1475? - 1557), called Caramuru by the Tupinambá, was a Portuguese settler born in Viana do Castelo. He departed for the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1509, and his ship wrecked in the coast of Bahia, Diogo Álvares found himself among the Tupinambá Indians. The Tupinamba called him "Caramuru" ("Moray Eel" or "Creator of Fire") because of the fire of his weapon.
Later, Diogo Álvares founded a settlement called Vila Velha and married Paraguaçu (or Paraguassu), the daughter of Tupinamba's chief Morubixava Taparica. During the following twenty years, Diogo Álvares kept contact with European ships and used his influence on local Indians to help the Portuguese Crown and missionaries during the early years of Brazilian colonization.
In 1526, he traveled to France with his wife. Paraguaçu was baptized by Mary Catherine des Granches, wife of Jacques Cartier, under the name Catarina.
A couple of years later, he returned to Bahia and aided Tomé de Sousa in founding Salvador and creating the first General-Government of the Brazilian colony, by the request of King João III of Portugal .
He died in October 1557, was buried in the Church of Jesus, and left half of his wealth to the Jesuits. His wife, Catarina Paraguaçu died in 1582.
His sons, Gaspar, Gabriel and Jorge were declared knights by Governor Tomé de Sousa.

The Reese rises in the southern section of the Toiyabe Range, on the flanks of Arc Dome. In its upper reaches, the Reese River is a fast-flowing mountain stream surrounded by relatively lush growth including Aspen groves and cottonwood trees. It then flows north between the Toiyabe Range and the Shoshone Mountains for approximately half its length. The river then passes through a low point in the Shoshone Mountains and continues north between that range and the Fish Creek Mountains. Once it exits the Toiyabe Range it becomes a slow, muddy stream, and its waters are used for irrigation by scattered farms and ranches along its lower reaches. Although considered a tributary of the Humboldt, in most years the Reese dwindles into a chain of shallow pools long before it reaches the main stem. Only during infrequent floods does the Reese contribute water to the Humboldt, entering near Battle Mountain.Horton, Gary A. (2000). Humboldt River Chronology: an Overview. Carson City, Nev.: Nevada Division of Water Planning. pp. 55-59.
The river is named after John Reese, who explored the area in 1854 as part of the expedition of Colonel Edward Steptoe, and who later served as a guide to Captain James H. Simpson's survey of a military road through central Nevada. The mining boomtown of Austin, located in the upper reaches of the Reese River, names its long-lived newspaper the Reese River Reveille."Reese River Reveille Newspager, Austin, NV."

The Yellow-naped Parrot or Yellow-naped Amazon (Amazona auropalliata) is an Amazon parrot sometimes considered to be a subspecies of Yellow-crowned Amazon, Amazona ochrocephala (Gmelin, 1788).
Deforestation is reducing the number of these parrots in the wild together with illegal removal of young for the pet trade. This parrot readily mimics sounds, and in captivity this includes human speech, which is probably the reason it is popular in the pet trade.  Like all parrots, however, mimic abilities vary greatly between individuals.

[[Consualia]]
CATEGORIES: Ancient chariot racing, Ancient Roman festivals, Fixed holidays

The Consuales Ludi or Consualia was the name of two ancient Roman festivals in honor of Consus, a tutelary deity of the harvest and stored grain. Consuales Ludi were held on August 18 (Plutarch, Life of Romulus, 15), at the time of harvest, and again on December 15, in connection with grain storage. The harvest grains were stored in underground vaults, and the temple of Consus was also underground. This shrine was covered with earth all year and was only uncovered for this one day. Mars, as a protector of the harvest, was also honored on this day, as were the Lares, the household gods that individual families held sacred.
During the celebration horses, mules, and asses were exempted from all labour, and were led through the streets adorned with garlands and flowers. Chariot races were held this day in the Circus Maximus, which included an odd race in which chariots were pulled by mules.
In Roman mythology, the Consulia was founded by Romulus as an occasion to gather his Sabine neighbors. When the community was assembled and in a state of drunken festivity, Romulus's men abducted the daughters of the Sabines to become their brides (see "The Rape of the Sabine Women").
There were also sacrifices to Consus on 7 July and 15 December.  Consus' feasts were followed by those of the related goddess Ops: the Opiconsivia on 25 August and the Opalia on 19 December.
According to Livy,Ab Urbe Condita, I, 9. the festival honors Neptune.

[[Fromage blanc]]

CATEGORIES: Dairy products

Fromage blanc (also known as maquée and similar to some kinds of quark) is a cheese originating from the north of France and the south of Belgium. The name means "white cheese" in French. Fromage frais differs from fromage blanc in that, according to French legislation:Note d'information accompagnant le décret n°2007-628 relatif aux fromages et spécialités fromagères Ministère de l'économie
So the former must contain live cultures when sold, whereas with fromage blanc fermentation has been halted. Fromage frais is a creamy soft cheese made with whole or skimmed milk and cream. It has the consistency of cream cheese, but less fat. Pure fromage blanc is virtually fat free, but cream is frequently added to improve the flavour, which also increases the fat content, frequently to as high as eight percent of total weight. 
Fromage blanc can be served either as a dessert similar to yogurt, frequently with added fruit, or in savoury dishes. In many Western countries, fromage blanc is sold in supermarkets alongside yogurts.

[tpl]Distinguish|IW engine[tpl]![/tpl]Infinity Ward Engine[/tpl]

Infinity Engine is a game engine which allows the creation of isometric role-playing video games. It was originally developed by BioWare for a prototype RTS game codenamed Battleground Infinity, which was ultimately re-engineered to become the first installment of the Baldur's Gate series. BioWare used it again in the subsequent installments of the series, but also licensed the engine to Interplay's Black Isle Studios.
Infinity Engine features pausable realtime gameplay. The engine uses a three quarters perspective with pre-rendered 2D backgrounds and sprite-based characters. Although graphically 2D for the most part, Baldur's Gate II added the use of OpenGL to accelerate drawing. Designed for six-character party-based adventuring by default, the Infinity Engine was the spiritual successor to the Gold Box Engine,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl] and provided the basis for five Dungeons & Dragons licensed role-playing video games plus additional expansion packs and a number of fanmade total conversion RPGs. It was succeeded by BioWare's Aurora Engine.
A free compatible game engine recreation is in development under the name of GemRB. It runs on multiple platforms, including FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Android and AmigaOS 4. Entire suites of reverse-engineered modding tools were written for Windows, Mac OS, and OS X in the engine's heyday.[tpl]Wayback |url=http://ire.mainecoon.net/|title=Adventurers' Spa & Grill - Index & News|date=20040131204613[/tpl]

Saturday Night was a Canadian general interest magazine. It was founded in Toronto, Ontario in 1887.
The publication was first established as a weekly broadsheet newspaper about public affairs and the arts, which was later expanded into a general interest magazine.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/10/20/saturday_night_suspend_051020.html|title=Publisher shelves Saturday Night|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=CBC | date=October 20, 2005[/tpl] The editor, Edmund E. Sheppard, was prevented from editing a daily newspaper due to an earlier libel action. Additionally, Blue laws in Toronto prevented publication on Sunday. So, in its first years, the paper was restricted to being a weekly publication, published on Saturdays.
Saturday Night has been through a number of owners, formats, and frequencies of publication. The last standalone monthly issue, published by then-owner Conrad Black, was March 2000 (Vol 115 No 2, Issue #3819). After a hiatus of two months it was relaunched as a weekend supplement in Black's National Post, continuing as Vol 115 No 3, Issue #3819. It was issued weekly in this format until September 22, 2001 (Vol 116 No 35 Issue #3885) when it was cancelled as part of CanWest's cutbacks at the National Post.
The title was purchased by MultiVision Publishing and re-emerged under editor Matthew Church as a bimonthly (and later 10 times-a-year) newsstand magazine (with some copies inserted in subscription National Posts) beginning in April 2002 as Vol 117, No 1, Issue #3886. Later purchased by St Joseph Media, publication was ended in November 2005 with Issue #3916, which is at present the last printed issue of Saturday Night.
On October 20, 2005, the company announced that publication would be "suspended" due to insufficient advertiser support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051020/sat_night_051020?s_name=&no_ads=|title=Saturday Night magazine suspended again|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=Canadian Press[/tpl] The editor at the time of suspension was Gary Ross, who had been editor since 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/08/19/satnight040819.html|title=West Coast author-editor takes editorship of Saturday Night|accessdate=2007-02-17|publisher=CBC | date=August 19, 2004[/tpl]
On December 18, 2008, the Saturday Night website was relaunched as a blog, with the initial post indicating that the site would "canvas the country and present you with a unique and intriguing perspective on our national life in politics and power, sex and crime, entertainment and culture, arts and literature, style and design." However, after five posts made that day, the blog was abandoned and has not been updated since.

[[Beurs van Berlage]]

CATEGORIES: Rijksmonuments in Amsterdam, Buildings and structures completed in 1903

The Beurs van Berlage is a building on the Damrak, in the centre of Amsterdam. It was designed as a commodity exchange by architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage and constructed between 1896 and 1903.  It influenced many modernist architects, in particular functionalists and the Amsterdam School.  It is now used as a venue for concerts, exhibitions and conferences.
The building is constructed of red brick, with an iron and glass roof and stone piers, lintels and corbels.  Its entrance is under a 40m high clock tower, while inside lie three large multi-storey halls formerly used as trading floors, with offices and communal facilities grouped around them.
The aim of the architect was to modify the styles of the past by emphasizing sweeping planes and open plan interiors. It has stylistic similarities with some earlier buildings, for instance St Pancras station and the work of H. H. Richardson in America, or the Castell dels Tres Dragons, Barcelona, by Lluís Domènech i Montaner.  True to its nineteenth-century roots, it maintains the use of ornament in a civic structure.
On 2 February 2002 the civil ceremony of the wedding of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and Máxima Zorreguieta took place in the Beurs van Berlage.
The Beurs van Berlage has a café located on the Beursplein side and the tower is also open to the public.

Labin ([tpl]lang-it|Albona[/tpl]) is a town in Istria, Croatia, with a town population of 6,893 (2011) and 11,642 in the greater municipality (which also includes the small towns of Rabac and Vinež, as well as a number of smaller villages).[tpl]Croatian Census 2011|S|18|2224[/tpl]
Labin developed from the site of the Roman settlement of Albona. Before and under the Roman occupation, Albona was an important commune. On a marble tablet the Roman inscription we read that under the Emperor Marco Iulio Severo Filippo noble Caesar noble Prince made Albona a Republic. To be a republic it had to have two joined Magistrates called Duumviri and Public officers called Aediles which took care of Public buildings and other official duties.[tpl]cite book|title=Statuto municipale della città di Albona dell'a. 1341|year=1870|publisher=Società del Gabinetto di Minerva,|location=Trieste|pages=III–XVI|url=http://books.google.hr/books?id=qgYuAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Labin, Yugoslavia|editor=Societa del Gabinetto di Minerva|accessdate=19 December 2013|language=Italian[/tpl][tpl]page number|date=April 2014[/tpl]
From 1295 it was under the rule of the dukes of Pazin, and from 1381 it found itself under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. From 1420 until 1797 it was ruled from Venice and after that belonged to Austria. Labin, as a Croatian-speaking town, was for a long time the centre of Croatia's largest coal mining district, with four mines operating at the height of its production. In March and April 1921, the town was the scene of a miners' strike which quickly grew into an anti-fascist rebellion, considered to be the first of its kind, and the declaration of the short-lived Labin Republic (also known as the Albona Republic).G. Scotti - L. Giuricin. La Repubblica di Albona e il movimento dell'occupazione delle fabbriche in Italia The mine in downtown Albona closed in the 1950s, while the last mine was closed down in 1989. The large, coal-fired power plant in nearby Fianona now has its coal imported from outside sources once the mines were closed.
The famous Lutheran reformer Matthias Flacius Illyricus (3 March 1520 – 11 March 1575), was born in Albona and a small exhibition in what was once his house, commemorates this. Unfortunately, due to the counter-reformation, he was forced to live most of his life in exile in Germany where he became the undisputed leader of the conservative wing of the Lutheran movement after the death of Luther. His chief literary legacy was in the area of biblical exegesis.

The U.S. Navy warships that escorted the tankers, part of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, were the operations' most visible part, but U.S. Air Force AWACS radar planes provided surveillance and U.S. Army special operations helicopters hunted for possible attackers.
Other U.S Navy vessels participated in Operation Ernest Will. They were then under the command of the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet which had primary responsibility for combat operations in the Persian Gulf region. The numerous ships used in Operation Ernest Will mostly consisted of Battleship Battle Groups, Carrier Battle Groups, Surface Action Groups and ships from the Pacific's Third and Seventh Fleets and the Mediterranean-based Sixth Fleet. They generally operated in and near the Gulf for parts of their normal six-month deployments.
This was USSOCOM's first tactical operation involving Navy SEALs, Special Boat Teams, and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) ("Nightstalkers") aviators working together.

Barbara Woolworth Hutton (November 14, 1912 – May 11, 1979) was an American debutante/socialite, heiress and philanthropist. She was dubbed the "Poor Little Rich Girl," first when she was given a lavish and expensive debutante ball in 1930, amid the Great Depression, and later due to a notoriously troubled private life.
Heiress to the retail tycoon Frank Winfield Woolworth, Hutton was one of the wealthiest women in the world. She endured a childhood marked by the early loss of her mother at age 5 and the neglect of her father setting the stage for a life of difficulty forming relationships. Seven times married, all of which ended in divorce and none of which lasted more than three years, she acquired grand foreign titles but was maliciously treated and often exploited by several of her husbands. While publicly she was much envied for her possessions, her beauty and her apparent life of leisure, privately she remained deeply insecure, often taking refuge in drink, drugs, and playboys. 
Hutton bore one child, Lance Reventlow, with her second husband, but was an indifferent and insecure parent and the subsequent divorce ended in a bitter custody battle. She later developed anorexia which inhibited further childbirth.  Her son died in a plane crash in 1972 at the age of 36 leaving her devastated.  She lived another seven years after the death of her son, dying of a heart attack at age 66.  At her death, the  formerly wealthy Hutton was on the verge of bankruptcy as a result of exploitation, as well as her compulsive generosity and spendthrift ways.

Solin (Latin: Salona, Ancient Greek: Σαλώνα) is a town in Dalmatia, Croatia. It is situated right northeast of Split, on the Adriatic Sea and the river Jadro.
Solin developed on the location of ancient town of Salona which was the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and the birthplace of Emperor Diocletian. After the arrival of Avars and Slavs A History of the Croatian by Francis Ralph Preveden,1955 in the 7th-century town was destroyed, and its refugees moved to settlement in and around Diocletian's palace, "Spalatum" (Split), turning it into a fortified town. In the Early Middle Ages Solin was part of the Croatian territory and played an important role in Medieval Croatian state, being one of capital cities.
In the 20th century intensive industrialisation process of the Split basin made Solin no more than a suburb of Split. Today, with its independent municipal status, Solin is part of the Split conurbation, well connected with other towns. Besides industry, a tourism is being developed lately based on numerous archaeological sites and Solin's distinctive image that comes from many urban parks along the Jadro.

Operation Praying Mantis was an attack on April 18, 1988, by U.S. naval forces within Iranian territorial waters in retaliation for the Iranian mining of the Persian Gulf during the Iran–Iraq war and the subsequent damage to an American warship.
On 14 April, the guided missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine while deployed in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will, the 1987–88 convoy missions in which U.S. warships escorted reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers to protect them from Iranian attacks. The explosion blew a 25-foot (7.6-meter) hole in the Roberts's hull and nearly sank it. The crew saved their ship with no loss of life, and Roberts was towed to Dubai on 16 April. After the mining, U.S. Navy divers recovered other mines in the area. When the serial numbers were found to match those of mines seized along with the Iran Ajr the previous September, U.S. military officials planned a retaliatory operation against Iranian targets in the Persian Gulf.
According to Bradley Peniston, the attack by the U.S. helped pressure Iran to agree to a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer, ending the eight-year conflict between the Persian Gulf neighbors.[ref]
, p. 217.[/ref]
On November 6, 2003, the International Court of Justice ruled that "the actions of the United States of America against Iranian oil platforms on 19 October 1987 (Operation Nimble Archer) and 18 April 1988 (Operation Praying Mantis) cannot be justified as measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States of America." However, the International Court of Justice dismissed Iran's claim that the attack by United States Navy was a breach of the 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries.[tpl]cite web|title=Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This battle was the largest of the five major U.S. surface engagements since the Second World War, which also include the Battle of Chumonchin Chan during the Korean War, the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the Battle of Dong Hoi during the Vietnam War, and the Action in the Gulf of Sidra in 1986.

It is the second of three church temples that have been built in Illinois (The first and the third being the Nauvoo Temple and the Nauvoo Illinois Temple).  Located in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, the site of Chicago Illinois Temple was dedicated on August 13, 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley, a member of the church's First Presidency.  The structure itself was constructed in Gray buff marble and its roof features gray slate.  Architects used a revolutionary design for LDS temples, adapting the traditional six-spire design and adding modern motifs. 
The Chicago temple is able to accommodate a broad spectrum of church members, from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds as Spanish, Polish, Korean and other Asian cultures, as well as members who are deaf. Construction of the temple also allowed local Latter-day Saints to contribute their means, talents, and time. Children donated pennies. Young women made dolls for the temple nursery. Women crocheted and tatted altar cloths. Many donated hours in helping with the open house, held 15 July–3 August 1985, during which over one hundred thousand people toured the temple. Hinckley dedicated the Chicago Illinois Temple on August 9, 1985. The temple now has a total of [tpl]convert|29751|sqft|m2[/tpl], five ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms.

Lambda Theta Phi is a non-profit social fraternity in the United States. It was founded on December 1, 1975 as a Latino Fraternity in the U.S. at Kean College in Union, New Jersey. It emphasizes Latin unity and the celebration of the Latin culture. In 1992, Lambda Theta Phi was accepted into the North-American Interfraternity Conference.  With its acceptance into the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1992 it became the first nationally recognized Latino Greek lettered organization in the U.S. In 1994, with the release of The History of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc., the fraternity published a historical account about its organization.
Lambda Theta Phi has received commendations from the American Red Cross for its fundraising efforts on behalf of victims of earthquakes in Italy and Mexico, mud-slides in Puerto Rico, volcanic eruptions in Colombia, the homeless in the United States and hurricanes in Florida. Lambda Theta Phi has also received commendations from the Division of Youth and Family Services, various other community service organizations as well as proclamations, resolutions and commendations from the United States Congress and some state legislatures. The American Heart Association also commends Lambda Theta Phi for adopting the association as their National Philanthropy. Some of the fraternity's chapters have raised $1,000 or more for the fight against heart disease.
Although Lambda Theta Phi is Latino by tradition, membership is open to all college males.
Since its founding, the organization has expanded across the United States. The organization strives to make an impact on not just undergraduate students, but also their surrounding community at large, through positive social actions. Lambda Theta Phi's goals are to promote scholarship, Latin unity, respect for all cultures and brotherhood.

[[Contrast ratio]]
CATEGORIES: Engineering ratios, Television technology

The contrast ratio is a property of a display system, defined as the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color (white) to that of the darkest color (black) that the system is capable of producing. A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display. It has similarities with dynamic range.
There is no official, standardized way to measure contrast ratio for a system or its parts, nor is there a standard for defining "Contrast Ratio" that is accepted by any standards organization so ratings provided by different manufacturers of display devices are not necessarily comparable to each other due to differences in method of measurement, operation, and unstated variables.Evan Powell. Let's Ignore Contrast Specs. March 27, 2008.  Manufacturers have traditionally favored measurement methods that isolate the device from the system, whereas other designers have more often taken the effect of the room into account. An ideal room would absorb all the light reflecting from a projection screen or emitted by a CRT, and the only light seen in the room would come from the display device. With such a room, the contrast ratio of the image would be the same as the contrast ratio of the device. Real rooms reflect some of the light back to the displayed image, lowering the contrast ratio seen in the image.  
Static contrast ratio is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing simultaneously at any instant of time, while dynamic contrast ratio is the luminosity ratio comparing the brightest and darkest color the system is capable of producing over time (while the picture is moving). Moving from a system that displays a static motionless image to a system that displays a dynamic, changing picture slightly complicates the definition of the contrast ratio, due to the need to take into account the extra temporal dimension to the measuring process.

Intercession of the saints is a doctrine held by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, many Anglicans and some Lutherans that saints may be asked to intercede (or pray) for others. The doctrine of requesting intercession from saints can be found in Christian writings from the 3rd century AD.Examples of saintly intercession in the early church are listed at the end of the following article: http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/invocationofsaints.aspxThe following article has some other examples from the early church: http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp

[[Universal pragmatics]]

CATEGORIES: Social philosophy, Critical theory, Semantics, Pragmatics, Epistemology, Philosophy of language

Universal pragmatics, more recently placed under the heading of formal pragmatics, is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an understanding through communication. The philosopher Jürgen Habermas coined the term in his essay "What is Universal Pragmatics?" (Habermas 1979), where he suggests that human competition, conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of modal confusions.  The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social conflict.
By coming to an "understanding," he means at the very least, when two or more social actors share the same meanings about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social expectations (or a "mutually recognized normative background"). (1979:3)
For Habermas, the goal of coming to an understanding is "intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual trust, and accord with one another". (1979:3)  In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas' goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the social coordination needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives. (See Communicative action of 1983)
As an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from pragmatics, semantics, semiotics, informal logic, and the philosophy of language, through social philosophy, sociology, and symbolic interactionism, to ethics, especially discourse ethics, and on to epistemology and the philosophy of mind.

His first pamphlet, Two Poems, was printed privately in 1893 and his first book of verse, The Vinedresser, was published in 1899. His love for poetry led him to become an active member of the Poetry Recital Society. His first (of 31) plays to be produced was Aphrodite against Artemis (1906), staged by the Literary Theatre Club of which he became a member in 1908. He received a civil list pension in 1920 in recognition for his contribution to literature and in 1930 he was nominated as one of seven candidates for the position of Poet Laureate. He died on 18 July 1944 at Windsor, Berkshire. 
He adopted the use of his middle name 'Sturge' (his mother's family name) as a way of avoiding confusion with the poet Thomas Moore.

The Nauvoo Illinois Temple is the 113th dedicated temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It is the third such temple that has been built in Illinois (the original Nauvoo Temple and Chicago Illinois Temple being the others).
Located in the town of Nauvoo, the temple's construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000. The structure itself was built in the Greek Revival architectural style using limestone block quarried in Russellville, Alabama. It is built in the same location as the original structure that was dedicated in 1846.
The building measures [tpl]convert|130|ft|m[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|90|ft|m[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|162|ft|m[/tpl] tall to the top of the statue of Angel Moroni.  It has an area of [tpl]convert|54000|sqft|m2[/tpl].  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the Kirtland Temple also has a bell tower.
Church leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the 19th-century temple, which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well. Its interior floor plan is noticeably different from that of the old Nauvoo Temple, as is the style of the golden angel at the top of the spire. The completion and official dedication was celebrated on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith, the church's founder.
Up to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.[tpl]cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= 2006-08-22 |newspaper= USA Today |agency= AP [/tpl]

Walter Frederick Ferrier (1865 – 1950) was a Canadian geologist and mining engineer.
He graduated from McGill University’s school of mining engineering. He was a tireless mineral collector and was known for walking straight into mining offices to request specimens. Consequently, he created large collections of mineral specimens of a quality still admired to this day. Many classic specimens would never be in collections had it not been for his effort and skill. 
The mineral specimens he amassed were instrumental in creating the mineral collections of the Smithsonian in Washington DC, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, University of Alberta, and the museum particularly dear to his heart, the Redpath Museum at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
During one of his collecting trips he noticed a bladed mineral enclosed in chalcedony on the edge of Kamloops Lake in the Kamloops Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada. It turned out to be a new member of the Zeolite family of minerals. Subsequently, it was named after him - Ferrierite. The type material of this mineral is stored at the Redpath Museum and is part of a separate collection that also bears his name.

[[Martian spherules]]

CATEGORIES: Mars, Rocks on Mars

Martian spherules (also known as blueberries due to their blue hue in false-color images released by NASA) are the abundant spherical hematite inclusions discovered by the Mars rover Opportunity at Meridiani Planum on the planet Mars. They are found in situ embedded in a sulfate salt evaporitic matrix, and also loose on the surface.
The shapes by themselves don't reveal the particles' origin with certainty. "A number of straightforward geological processes can yield round shapes," said Dr. Hap McSween, an Opportunity science team member from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. They include accretion under water, but apparent pores in the particles make alternative possibilities of meteor impacts or volcanic eruptions more likely origins, he said.
For example, ranging in size from less than 100 micrometers to more than 250 micrometers, similar spherules were found in Moon soil samples collected by Apollo 12 at the Procellarum Basin, and Apollo 14 near Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains), the dark crater that dominates the Moon's face, and their properties were consistent with expectations for creation by meteor impacts.
"We see these strange round objects we're calling "spherules" embedded in the outcrop, like blueberries in a muffin. The outcrop erodes away as it gets sandblasted, and the spherules (which seem to resist erosion better than the rest of the outcrop does) fall out and roll down the hill. Weird." said Dr. Steve Squyres.
The spheres may have formed when molten rock was sprayed into the air by a volcano or a meteor impact. Or, they may be concretions, or accumulated material, formed by minerals coming out of solution as water diffused through rock, he said in a February 9 press conference.
Not only are there spherules on the surface but they are also found deeper in the Martian soil. The difference between these and ones which were found at the surface was that they had a very shiny surface, that created strong glints and glares which made them appear shiny or polished.  On March 2, Opportunity mission scientists reported that they concluded a survey of the distribution of spherules in the bedrock.  They found that the spherules spread out evenly and randomly inside the rocks, and not in layers. This supports the notion that they grew in place, since if their origin was related to volcanic or meteoric episodes one would expect layers of spherules as a "record in time" for each event. This observation was added to the list of evidence for liquid water being present at this rock site, where it is thought the spherules formed.

The Quit India Act ([tpl]lang-hi|भारत छोड़ो आन्दोलन[/tpl] [tpl]IAST|Bhārat Chhodo Āndolan[/tpl]), or the  India August Movement (August Kranti) was a civil disobedience movement launched in India in August 1942 in response to Mohandas Gandhi's call for satyagraha. The All-India Congress Committee proclaimed a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called "an orderly British withdrawal" from India. The call for determined, but passive resistance appears in his call to Do or Die, issued on 8 August at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Mumbai on year 1942. 
The British were prepared to act. Almost the entire INC leadership, and not just at the national level, was imprisoned without trial within hours after Gandhi's speech—at least 60,000 people. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council (which had a majority of Indians), of the Muslims, the Communist Party, the princely states, the Imperial and state police, the Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen were profiting from heavy wartime spending and did not support Quit India.  Many students paid more attention to Subhas Chandra Bose, who was in exile and supporting the Axis. The only outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to Indian demands. The Quit India campaign was effectively crushed.[tpl]cite book|author=Arthur Herman|authorlink= Arthur L.

The British refused to grant immediate independence, saying it could happen only after the war ended.
thumb|Procession view at Bangalore Sporadic small-scale violence took place around the country but the British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945, and suppressed civil rights, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. In terms of immediate objectives Quit India failed because of heavy-handed suppression, weak coordination and the lack of a clear-cut programme of action. However, the British government realized that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for postwar became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

[[Climate of India]]

CATEGORIES: Climate of India

Analysed according to the Köppen system, the climate of India resolves into six major climatic subtypes; their influences give rise to desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, humid tropical regions supporting rain forests in the southwest, and Indian Ocean island territories that flank the Indian subcontinent. Regions have starkly different—yet tightly clustered—microclimates. The nation is largely subject to four seasons: winter (January and February), summer (March to May), a monsoon (rainy) season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to December).
India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically break-all monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayan system bars the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.
Though the Tropic of Cancer—the boundary between the tropics and subtropics—passes through the middle of India, the bulk of the country can be regarded as climatically tropical. As in much of the tropics, monsoonal and other weather patterns in India can be wildly unstable: epochal droughts, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters are sporadic, but have displaced or ended millions of human lives. There is widespread scientific consensus that South Asia is likely to see such climatic events, along with their aleatory unpredictability, to change in frequency and are likely to increase in severity. Ongoing and future vegetative changes and current sea level rises and the attendant inundation of India's low-lying coastal areas are other impacts, current or predicted, that are attributable to global warming.[tpl]Sfn|Ravindranath|Bala|Sharma|2011[/tpl]

[[Pitchout]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball terminology

In baseball, a pitchout is a ball that is intentionally thrown high and outside of the strike zone with the purpose of preventing a stolen base or thwarting a hit and run. The pitcher delivers the ball in such a manner for it to be unhittable and in a position where the catcher can quickly leap to his feet to catch it. A well-thrown pitchout will allow the catcher to receive the ball standing up as opposed to his usual squat, giving him a better line to throw to a base without the pitcher or the batter obstructing his vision or aim. Moreover, it is easier to throw a ball with more force from a standing position than it is from a squat, which is why most catchers leap to their feet when attempting to throw out a base stealer.
The pitchout is often called for when the catcher believes that an existing baserunner is likely to attempt a steal, and forms one of the two (with the pickoff) main countermeasures a pitcher can take against a potential stealer. A runner attempting to steal on a pitchout will have an extremely difficult time beating the throw to second base and almost no chance of stealing third barring a mistake by the catcher or the third baseman.
The pitchout is also used against the hit and run. As the pitch is unhittable, the runner will have to attempt a straight steal, and for the reasons described above will usually fail.
A pitchout is thrown in around the same location as an intentional ball, but differs in that a pitchout is thrown harder to give the catcher the most time to throw out the base runner. Of course, a pitchout is technically an intentional ball, but the term is not used to describe the pitchout in conversation.

[[Earl of Richmond]]
CATEGORIES: Earldoms in the Peerage of England, Forfeited peerages

The now-extinct title of Earl of Richmond was created many times in the Peerage of England.  The earldom of Richmond was initially held by various Breton nobles associated with the Ducal crown of Brittany; sometimes the holder was the Breton Duke himself, including one member of the cadet branch of the French Capetian dynasty. The historical ties between the Ducal crown of Brittany and this English Earldom were maintained ceremonially by the Breton dukes even after England ceased to recognize the Breton Dukes as Earls of England and those dukes rendered homage to the King of France, rather than the English crown. It was then held either by members of the English royal families of  Plantagenet and Tudor, or English nobles closely associated with the English crown. It was eventually merged into the English crown during the reign of Henry VII and has been recreated as a Dukedom.

[[Intelligence Bureau (India)]]

CATEGORIES: Indian intelligence agencies

The Intelligence Bureau (IB) (Devanāgarī: खूफिया ब्यूरो, khūphiyā byūro) is India's internal intelligence agency and reputedly the world's oldest intelligence agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/india/ib/index.html |title=Intelligence Bureau (IB) - India Intelligence Agencies |publisher=Fas.org |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2012-12-09[/tpl] It was recast as the Central Intelligence Bureau in 1947 under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The reason for the perception may be because, in 1885, Major General Sir Charles MacGregor was appointed Quartermaster General and head of the Intelligence Department for the British Indian Army at Simla. The objective then was to monitor Russian troop deployments in Afghanistan, fearing a Russian invasion of British India through the North-West during the late 19th century.
In 1909, the Indian Political Intelligence Office was established in England in response to the development of Indian revolutionary activities, which came to be called the Indian Political Intelligence (IPI) from 1921. This was a state-run surveillance and monitoring agency. The IPI was run jointly by the India Office and the Government of India and reported jointly to the Secretary of the Public and Judicial Department of the India Office, and the Director of Intelligence Bureau (DIB) in India, and maintained close contact with Scotland Yard and MI5.
Serving since December 2012, Syed Asif Ibrahim is the current director of the IB, the first Muslim to hold the position.[tpl]cite web|author=Sandeep Joshi |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ib-raw-get-new-chiefs/article4135336.ece |title=Today's Paper / NATIONAL : IB, RAW get new chiefs |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-09[/tpl]

The Rhymers' Club was a group of London-based poets, founded in 1890 by W. B. Yeats and Ernest Rhys. Originally not much more than a dining club, it produced anthologies of poetry in 1892 and 1894.The Oxford Companion to English Literature (2010) They met at the London pub ‘Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese’ in Fleet Street and in the 'Domino Room' of the Café Royal.Bernard Muddiman (1921) The Men of the Nineties, G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York
Those who took part also included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Francis Thompson, Richard Le Gallienne, John Gray, John Davidson, Edwin J. Ellis, Victor Plarr, Selwyn Image, Lord Alfred Douglas, Arthur Cecil Hillier, John Todhunter, G.A. Greene, Arthur Symons, Ernest Radford, and Thomas William Rolleston. Oscar Wilde attended some meetings that were held in private homes. The group as a whole matched quite closely Yeats' retrospective idea of 'the tragic generation', destined for failure and in many cases early death.
Along with the social element of the Rhymers' Club, they published two volumes of verse. The first, entitled The Book of the Rhymers' Club was published by Elkin Matthews in 1892. The Second Book of the Rhymers' Club appeared two years later in 1894, published by the recently merged Elkin Matthews and John Lane. They had print runs of 450 and 650 respectively. Those of the group appearing in these two volumes were: T.W. Rolleston, John Todhunter, W.B. Yeats, Richard Le Gallienne, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Cecil Hillier, Ernest Dowson, Victor Plarr, Ernest Radford, Arthur Symons, G.A. Greene, Edwin J. Ellis, and Ernest Rhys. 
This seemingly dualistic existence of the club (i.e. on one hand meeting informally at the Cheshire Cheese or in private homes; on the other hand producing anthologies of verse) makes determining the club's members rather tricky at times. Indeed, there are certain poets who were known to have attended meetings but never had their verse appear in either of the books. Also, certain poets feature in one book without featuring in the other.
By the time Arthur Ransome wrote his Bohemia in London in 1907, the group had already passed into legend: "... the Rhymer's Club used to meet, to drink from tankards, smoke clay pipes, and recite their own poetry". In fact, Ransome's research was less than thorough; the group continued to meet in some form until about 1904.

[[Gulyásleves]]
CATEGORIES: Hungarian cuisine, Soups, Beef dishes

Gulyásleves (gulyás is herdsman, leves is soup in Hungarian), is a Hungarian soup, made of beef, vegetables, ground paprika and other spices.  It originates from a dish cooked by the cattlemen (gulyás also means herdsman) who tended their herds in the Great Hungarian Plain, known as the Alföld or Puszta in Hungarian. These Hungarian cowboys often camped out with their cattle days away from populated areas, so they had to make their food from ingredients they could carry with themselves, and this food had to be cooked in the one available portable cauldron (called bogrács) over an open fire.
The word bogrács is a loanword from Ottoman Turkish باقراج (spelled bakraç in modern Turkish), meaning a cauldron made of copper; from باقر (spelled bakır in modern Turkish) meaning “copper”. 
The original dish called bográcsgulyás was a stew, not a soup. Traditional Hungarian bográcsgulyás (cauldron gulyás) is often still cooked outdoors over an open fire in a cauldron, a Hungarian style "Barbecue".
Later on when the dish left the peasant cuisines and became popular even in the town, it started to be cooked more like a soup. Nowadays the dish served in the Hungarian restaurants is a soup, but the locals cook the dish called gulyás  as a stew and gulyásleves (leves means soup) like a soup.
There are different variations of the recipe. The meat is beef, but often mixed meats are used (e.g. beef, pork and mutton/lamb). Tomatoes, carrots and fresh peppers (often hot chilies) are also added. Onions, paprika and caraway seeds provide its flavour. Cubed potatoes or pasta squares are typically added to this spicy soup. This dish is not to be confused with other dishes called "pörkölt" or "paprikás".

Earl of Sussex is a title that has been created several times in the Peerages of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom. The early Earls of Arundel (up to 1243) were often also called Earls of Sussex.
The fifth creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1717 in favour of Talbot Yelverton, 2nd Viscount Longueville. The Yelverton family descended from Sir Christopher Yelverton, Speaker of the House of Commons from 1597 to 1598. Sir Christopher's grandson and namesake, Christopher Yelverton, was created a baronet, of Easton Mauduit in the County of Northampton, in the Baronetage of England in 1641. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Henry, the second Baronet. He married Susan Longueville, suo jure 13th Baroness Grey de Ruthyn. Their eldest son, Charles, succeeded in both the baronetcy and barony. However, he died young and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the fifteenth Baron. In 1690 he was created Viscount Longueville in the Peerage of England. His son, Henry, the aforementioned second Viscount, was created Earl of Sussex in 1727. Henry's two sons, George and Henry, both succeeded in the earldom. The baronetcy, viscountcy and earldom became extinct on Henry's death in 1799. He was succeeded in the barony of Grey de Ruthyn by his grandson, Henry, the nineteenth Baron, the son of his daughter Lady Barbara Yelverton by Colonel Edward Thoroton Gould. See Baron Grey de Ruthyn for further history of this title.

Earl of Winchester was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of England during the Middle Ages. The first was Saer de Quincy, who received the earldom in 1207/8 after his wife inherited half of the lands of the Beaumont earls of Leicester. This creation became extinct in 1265 upon the death without male heirs of Saer's son Roger de Quincy.  In 1322 Edward II created the elder Hugh le Despenser Earl of Winchester. This creation lapsed after Despenser's execution in 1326.
During his exile in 1470–71 Edward IV had been the guest of a Flemish nobleman, Louis de Bruges. After Edward's return to the throne Louis was rewarded with the earldom of Winchester. His son, the second Earl, returned it to the crown in 1500.
In medieval times earldoms closely associated with counties, and the Earls of Winchester were sometimes referred to as Earls of Southampton (for Winchester is the county seat of Hampshire, which in those days was known as County Southampton or Southamptonshire).

Ryzom, also known as The Saga of Ryzom, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Ryzom is labeled as Science-Fantasy by the creators due to storyline elements that are typically found in both science fiction and fantasy genres.  Originally developed by Nevrax, the game is now owned and operated by Winch Gate Property, Ltd.
The game is complex, and it incorporates many realistic effects, including changing weather and seasons. Computer controlled entities ('mobs') display complex behaviors, and animals will e.g. graze in herds or hunt in packs.  The game play is flexible (often referred to as sandbox), and instead of character classes, it has a unique system for character abilities that allows players to construct custom actions like spells or attacks in detail.
Ryzom also contains Ryzom Ring, a scenario editor that lets players design their own areas that can be uploaded and played on the official server.
Nevrax originally distributed the client software, NeL, as free software using the GPL,[ref]

[[Puffer train]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular automaton patterns

In a cellular automaton a puffer train, or simply puffer, is a finite pattern that moves itself across the "universe", leaving debris behind. Thus a pattern consisting of only a puffer will grow arbitrarily large over time. While both puffers and spaceships have periods and speeds, unlike puffers, spaceships do not leave debris behind.
The period of a puffer can be considered as the combination of two periods;  the first is the period of the puffer itself, while the second is the apparent period of the pattern of debris produced. This is often the same as the period of the puffer, but sometimes is a factor of the period. A puffer for which the apparent period deduced from the debris is smaller than the period of the engine is a pseudoperiod puffer. Such puffers are typically produced by artificial means. A true period puffer is one in which the period of the debris matches that of the puffer.
Puffers are divided into two classes, dirty puffers and clean puffers. While there is no precise distinction, a dirty puffer is one in which there is little apparent order in the debris (although the debris will still eventually be periodic). A clean puffer, conversely, has a small amount of debris that appears much more organized. A dirty puffer can sometimes be turned into a clean puffer by adding spaceships of the same velocity as the puffer that affect what debris results.
A puffer whose debris consists entirely of spaceships is called a rake.

A health savings account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/09/health-savings-accounts-an-introduction/|title=Health Savings Accounts|publisher=Health401k.com|accessdate=9 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/|publisher=U.S. Treasury|accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl]  The funds contributed to an account are not subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit. Unlike a flexible spending account (FSA), funds roll over and accumulate year to year if not spent.  HSAs are owned by the individual, which differentiates them from company-owned Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA) that are an alternate tax-deductible source of funds paired with either HDHPs or standard health plans.  HSA funds may currently be used to pay for qualified medical expenses at any time without federal tax liability or penalty. However, beginning in early 2011 OTC (over the counter) medications cannot be paid with HSA dollars without a doctor's prescription.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=227308,00.html|title=Affordable Care Act: Questions and Answers on Over-the-Counter Medicines and Drugs|date=3 September 2010|publisher=IRS|accessdate=9 December 2010[/tpl] Withdrawals for non-medical expenses are treated very similarly to those in an individual retirement account (IRA) in that they may provide tax advantages if taken after retirement age, and they incur penalties if taken earlier. These accounts are a component of consumer-driven health care.
Proponents of HSAs believe that they are an important reform that will help reduce the growth of health care costs and increase the efficiency of the health care system. According to proponents, HSAs encourage saving for future health care expenses, allow the patient to receive needed care without a gatekeeper to determine what benefits are allowed and make consumers more responsible for their own health care choices through the required High-Deductible Health Plan.
Opponents of HSAs say they may worsen, rather than improve, the U.S. health system's problems because people may hold back the healthcare spending that would be covered by their Health Savings Accounts, or may spend it unnecessarily just because it has accumulated and to avoid the penalty taxes for withdrawing it, while people who have health problems that have predictable annual costs will avoid HSAs in order to have those costs paid by insurance. There is also debate about consumer satisfaction with these plans.

The original Fortezza card (KOV-8) is a Type 2 product which means it cannot be used for classified information. The most widely used Type 1 encryption card is the KOV-12 Fortezza card which is used extensively for the Defense Message System (DMS). The KOV-12 is cleared up to TOP SECRET/SCI. A later version, called KOV-14 or Fortezza Plus, uses a Krypton microprocessor that implements stronger, Type 1 encryption and may be used for information classified up to TOP SECRET/SCI. It, in turn, is being replaced by the newer KSV-21 PC card with more modern algorithms and additional capabilities.
The Fortezza Plus card and its successors are used with NSA's Secure Terminal Equipment voice and data encryption systems that are replacing the STU-III. It is manufactured by the Mykotronx Corporation and by Spyrus. Each card costs about $240 and they are commonly used with card readers sold by Litronic Corporation.

Frederik Kaiser (Amsterdam, June 10, 1808 – Leiden, July 28, 1872) was a Dutch astronomer.
He was director of the Leiden Observatory from 1838 until his death.
He is credited with the advancement of Dutch astronomy through his scientific contributions of positional measurements, his popularization of astronomy in the Netherlands, and by helping to build a state-of-the-art observatory in 1861 (Today it is known as the "Old Observatory").
He made a series of drawings of Mars at its opposition in 1862 and made a fairly precise determination of its rotational period.
Craters on Mars and on the Moon are named in his honour, as well as asteroid 1694 Kaiser.
In Richard Proctor's now-abandoned Martian nomenclature, Syrtis Major Planum was called the "Kaiser Sea".  This nomenclature was later dropped in favor of the one introduced by Giovanni Schiaparelli.
Kaiser's parents were Johann Wilhelm Keyser and Anna Sibella Liernur but he was raised by his uncle Johan Frederik Keyser from the age of eight.[tpl]cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Publishing |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58738.html[/tpl]

[[Darkling beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Tenebrionidae

Darkling beetles are a family of beetles found worldwide, estimated at more than 20,000 species. Many of the beetles have black elytra, hence their common name. Apart from the 9 subfamilies listed here, the tribe Opatrini of the Tenebrioninae is sometimes considered a distinct family, and/or the Pimeliinae are included in the Tenebrioninae as a tribe Pimeliini.
Darkling beetles eat both fresh and decaying vegetation. Major predators include birds, rodents, sunspiders, and lizards. Some species live in the dry Namib desert and have evolved modifications that help them collect water from the fog that condenses on their elytra.
The larval stages of several species are cultured as feeder insects for captive insectivores, and include the very commonly known mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and superworms (Zophobas morio), and the lesser-known mini mealworms (Tenebrio obscurus).

Aleksander Mikhailovich Rodchenko ([tpl]lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Миха́йлович Ро́дченко[/tpl]; [tpl]OldStyleDate|5 December|1891|23 November[/tpl] – December 3, 1956) was a Russian artist, sculptor, photographer and graphic designer. He was one of the founders of constructivism and Russian design; he was married to the artist Varvara Stepanova.
Rodchenko was one of the most versatile Constructivist and Productivist artists to emerge after the Russian Revolution. He worked as a painter and graphic designer before turning to photomontage and photography. His photography was socially engaged, formally innovative, and opposed to a painterly aesthetic. Concerned with the need for analytical-documentary photo series, he often shot his subjects from odd angles—usually high above or down below—to shock the viewer and to postpone recognition. He wrote: "One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again."

Joseph Schlitz (May 15, 1831 – May 7, 1875) was a German entrepreneur who made his fortune in the brewing industry.
A native of Mainz, Germany, Schlitz emigrated to the U.S. in 1850.  In 1856 he assumed management of the Krug Brewery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  In 1858 he married Krug's widow and changed the name of the company to the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company. He became more successful after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, when he donated hundreds of barrels of beer as part of the relief effort.  Many of Chicago's breweries that had burnt were never to reopen; Schlitz established a distribution point there and acquired a large portion of the Chicago market.
Schlitz perished in a shipwreck off the coast of England in 1875 while he was returning to visit his native Germany. His body was never recovered but there is a cenotaph at Forest Home Cemetery, Milwaukee.

However, the language was probably similar to the other Celtic languages near to it, such as Gaulish. Due to the scanty evidence it is unknown when it became extinct.

The Life Zone concept was developed by C. Hart Merriam in 1889 as a means of describing areas with similar plant and animal communities. Merriam observed that the changes in these communities with an increase in latitude at a constant elevation are similar to the changes seen with an increase in elevation at a constant latitude.
The life zones Merriam identified are most applicable to western North America, being developed on the San Francisco Peaks, Arizona and Cascade Range of the northwestern USA. He tried to develop a system that is applicable across the North American continent, but that system is rarely referred to.
The life zones that Merriam identified, along with characteristic plants, are as follows:
The Canadian and Hudsonian life zones are commonly combined into a Boreal life zone.
This system has been criticized as being too imprecise. For example, the scrub oak chaparral in Arizona shares relatively few plant and animal species with the Great Basin sagebrush desert, yet both are classified as Upper Sonoran. However it is still sometimes referred to by biologists (and anthropologists) working in the western United States.  Much more detailed and empirically based classifications of vegetation and life zones now exist for most areas of the world.

[[Money belt]]

CATEGORIES: Belts, Bags, Travel gear

One form of money belt is a belt with a pouch attached to the front which is worn under a shirt to protect valuables from thieves and/or pickpockets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://studenttravel.about.com/od/mattersofmoney/qt/moneybelt.htm|publisher=studenttravel.about.com|title=Money Belts Hide Cash, Traveler's Checks and Papers|first=Kathleen | last=Crislip| accessdate=2014-01-27[/tpl] Another form appears to be an ordinary belt when worn, but contains one or more hidden pockets on the inside, often closed with a zipper. Money belts are often worn by tourists as a precaution against theft. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/story_3065.html|publisher=fodors.com|title=Pickpocket-proof: Money Belts and Their Alternatives|accessdate=2014-01-27[/tpl] Items typically placed in a money belt generally include such things as a passport, travel tickets, driver's license, credit cards, cash, and jewelry. A significant problem is that scammers, pickpockets, beggars, and the like, know that the presence of a money belt brings a high likelihood of the bearer being a tourist, and therefore a high value target, bringing more attention upon the wearer than desirable.

[[Magestorm]]

CATEGORIES: 1996 video games, First-person shooters, Multiplayer online games, Mythic Entertainment games

Rolemaster: Magestorm (since 2001, Magestorm Millennium) was an online-only first-person shooter using magical spells as weapons. It was developed in 1996 by Interworld Productions (now Mythic Entertainment). It centered on team-based gameplay and included some role-playing video game elements, notably the character class and level-based systems.  The four character classes were the Wizard, Psionic, Eldritch and Healer; but prior to Magestorm Millennium, the character classes were named as Magician, Mentalist, Arcanist and Cleric, respectively. A character could gain experience points by hitting other players and raise up to level 30. Each gained level gave spell picks which allowed to unlock new spells.
The game was a feature of various gaming services over the years. Firstly as part of the Engage Games Online service, before moving to AOL. For a time, there was choice between the hourly billing method of AOL's game service versus the flat monthly charge offered by rival service Gamestorm. The game was also briefly available via the Gamezone network in Europe.
When Electronic Arts purchased both the AOL Games Channel and Gamestorm, the game was shut down almost immediately in 2000. As compensation, players of the game were given free copies of Ultima Online. The game however was relaunched as Magestorm Millennium in 2001, on the Mythic-Realms game service, operated by Mythic Entertainment itself. It brought together the former two communities of AOL and Gamestorm and was one of the most popular games on the service, surpassing its spiritual successor, Spellbinder: The Nexus Conflict, developed in 1999.
This game is no longer officially available and was finally retired in January 2006, along with all other games offered on the Mythic-Realms gaming center excluding Dragon's Gate. An unofficial server emulator is however, currently in development as of January 2010. The emulator, "Magestorm: Revival" is in public testing and available to play currently.

[tpl]nihongo|Alice 19th|ありす19th|Arisu Naintīnsu[/tpl] is a Japanese shōjo manga written by Yuu Watase (creator of the popular manga series Ceres, Celestial Legend and Fushigi Yūgi). It appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Shōjo Comic.
As with many of her previous works, Watase wrote Alice 19th as a shōjo manga; but unlike her previous works, which showed a strong influence of Chinese culture and history, Alice 19th has a distinctly Western feel to it. 
The heroine's name, "Alice", and her encounter with a white rabbit (Nyozeka) basically starts the storyline. Watase has written that she thought of Alice in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll, in drafting the characters of Alice Seno and Nyozeka. From there she drafted her own story. 
From 2007 Viz Media released Alice 19th in English. The series, which is published in the traditional right-to-left format with foot-noted sound effects, spans a total of seven volumes.

[[Flexible spending account]]

CATEGORIES: Employment compensation, Taxation in the United States

A flexible spending account (FSA), also known as a flexible spending arrangement, is one of a number of tax-advantaged financial accounts that can be set up through a cafeteria plan of an employer in the United States. An FSA allows an employee to set aside a portion of earnings to pay for qualified expenses as established in the cafeteria plan, most commonly for medical expenses but often for dependent care or other expenses. Money deducted from an employee's pay into an FSA is not subject to payroll taxes, resulting in substantial payroll tax savings.  Before the Affordable Care Act, also known as "Obamacare", one significant disadvantage to using an FSA is that funds not used by the end of the plan year are lost to the employee, known as the "use it or lose it" rule. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, an employee can carryover up to $500 into the next year without losing the funds. [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.health401k.com/2011/09/flexible-spending-accounts-an-introduction/|title=Flexible Spending Accounts: An Introduction|publisher=Health401k|accessdate=September 24, 2011[/tpl]
The most common type of flexible spending account, the medical expense FSA (also medical FSA or health FSA), is similar to a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA).  However, while HSAs and HRAs are almost exclusively used as components of a consumer-driven health care plan, medical FSAs are commonly offered with more traditional health plans as well.  In addition, funds in a health savings account are not lost when the plan year is over, unlike funds in an FSA.  Paper forms or an FSA debit card, also known as a Flexcard, may be used to access the account funds.

Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity also called "Sig Tau" is a U.S. college social fraternity founded on June 28, 1920 at University of Central Missouri (then known as Central Missouri State Teachers College). The fraternity was born out of the desires and aspirations of seventeen men in the belief that all men are social creatures and that friendships of college men are lasting ones. It rose as a result of friendships made while in the service of their country during World War I in France. By dedicating themselves to the highest ideals of manhood, brotherhood and citizenship, they would inspire thousands of men from all parts of the country who would follow in their footsteps.Bernier, William P. "Our Heritage" page 35. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.
In accordance with the founding of Sigma Tau Gamma Fraternity at Central Missouri State Teachers College, the fraternity created new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers colleges (at the time also called "normal schools").  Since the fraternity's beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 140 university campuses across the United States.Bernier, William P. "Chapter Roll" page 120.

Mount Eisenhower (formerly Mount Pleasant) is a mountain in the Presidential Range in the White Mountains of New Hampshire approximately [tpl]convert|4780|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high.  Named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, its summit offers a 360° view of New Hampshire's mountains. It is inaccessible by road. 
The Crawford Path, carrying the Appalachian Trail, crosses the mountain near its summit.Daniell, Gene, and Smith, Steven D. White Mountain Guide. 28th ed. AMC Books, 2007. ISBN 978-1-929173-34-1. 41 It separates from the summit loop trail at [tpl]convert|4400|ft|m[/tpl], [tpl]convert|0.3|mi|km|abbr=on|1[/tpl] south of the summit, and rejoins it [tpl]convert|0.3|mi|km|abbr=on|1[/tpl] northeast of the summit, having made a net elevation gain of about [tpl]convert|40|ft[/tpl] and reached a maximum on Eisenhower of about [tpl]convert|4520|ft[/tpl].
The shortest trail route to the summit of Eisenhower is from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, to its westnorthwest, via primarily the Edmands Path. Several routes are available from points more or less southwest of it on Route 302; the most used of these (probably roughly equal in popularity to the Edmands route) is via the Crawford Path, starting from a parking lot on Mount Clinton Road, very near 302 and just north of the Highland Center in the Crawford Notch area.  Mount Monroe lies on the ridge northeast of Mt. Eisenhower, and Mount Pierce to the southwest. All three of these peaks are included on the peak-bagging list of four-thousand footers in New Hampshire.  Mount Franklin, an "unofficial" peak (not prominent enough to be included in the list), lies between Mount Eisenhower and Mount Monroe.

[[Fault (dog)]]

CATEGORIES: Dog shows and showing, Dog breeding

The term fault is used in animal breed standards to describe an aspect of appearance or temperament that is considered detrimental to the breed type of the animal's breed. In dogs, faults have to do with the externally observable qualities of the dog such as appearance, movement, and temperament. Qualities separately tested such as tests for ability in specific work or sports, tests for genetic health, tests for general health or specific inherited disease, or any other specific tests for characteristics that cannot be directly observed are not described with the term fault. Minor faults may or may not have anything to do with the individual dog's ability to work or suitability as a pet.

CATEGORIES: History of Nubia, Foreign contacts of ancient Egypt, Ancient Egyptian society, Military history of Africa

The Medjay (also Medjai, Mazoi, Madjai, Mejay, Egyptian mDA.y)–from mDA,Erman & Grapow, Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache, 2, 186.1-2 represents the name Ancient Egyptians gave to a region in northern Sudan–which an ancient people of Nubia inhabited.  In the New Kingdom, the word Medjay developed to refer to members of the Ancient Egyptian military as desert scouts and protectors of areas of pharaonic interest.  However, this evolution is more likely based on a change in the definition of the word, Medjay, rather than a change in the Eastern Desert peoples.

[[Nick at Nite]]

Nick at Nite (stylized as nick@nite) is a nighttime cable network that broadcasts over the channel space of Nickelodeon, owned by the MTV Networks Kids & Family Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. It broadcasts on Sunday-Wednesdays from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m., Thursdays and Fridays from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time).
Although it shares channel space with Nickelodeon, Nielsen counts Nick at Nite as a separate channel from Nickelodeon for ratings purposes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/25/business/fi-nick25 |title=Nickelodeon Squeezes 2 Ratings Out of 1 Very Diverse Network – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2004-03-25 |accessdate=2012-10-24[/tpl] Both services are sometimes collectively referred to as "Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite", due to their common association as two individual channels sharing a single channel space.NICKELODEON/NICK AT NITE (WEST)
Nick at Nite appeals to adult and/or adolescent audiences with a lineup of mainly live-action sitcom reruns and some limited original programming. However because Nick at Nite shares channel space with Nickelodeon (prefiguring Cartoon Network and Adult Swim), some of Nick at Nite is aimed at pre-teenagers ages 8-12 year olds, the content on Nick at Nite (though looser in regards to profanity and suggestive dialogue compared to the children's-oriented Nickelodeon) is not as raunchy and less violent, encouraging a crossover audience between it and Nickelodeon viewers.
As of August 2013, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite is available to approximately 98,799,000 pay television households (86.51% of households with television) in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/23/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-networks-is-in-cable-network-coverage-estimates-as-of-august-2013/199072/ |title=List of How Many Homes Each Cable Networks Is In - Cable Network Coverage Estimates As Of August 2013 |last=Seidman |first=Robert |work=TV by the Numbers |publisher=Zap2it |date=August 23, 2013 |accessdate=September 6, 2013[/tpl]

The Toronto City Hall is the home of the municipal government of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and one of the city's most distinctive landmarks. Designed by Finnish architect Viljo Revell (with Heikki Castrén, Bengt Lundsten, Seppo Valjus) and landscape architect Richard Strong, and engineered by Hannskarl Bandel, the building opened in 1965. It was built to replace Old City Hall, which was built in 1899.Ian Chodikoff "Days of Future Passed." The Canadian Architect. Vol. 50. Iss.8 (2005):26-27. Print. City of Toronto Archives. Toronto's New City Hall. n.p. , n.d. Web. 17 September 2010. The current City Hall, located at Nathan Phillips Square, is actually Toronto's fourth city hall and was built in order to replace the former city hall due to a shortage of space. The area of Toronto City Hall and the civic square was formerly the location of Toronto's Old Chinatown, which was expropriated and bulldozed during the mid-1950s in preparation for a new civic building.[tpl]citation|title=Chinatown: An illustrated history of the Chinese Communities of Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax |last=Yee |first=Paul |publisher=James Lorimer & Company Limited |location=Toronto, ON, CAN |year=2005[/tpl]
In 1958, an international architectural competition was launched by Mayor Nathan Phillips in order to find a design for the New City Hall. This competition was won by Finnish architect Viljo Revell whose winning proposal came first amongst submissions from forty-two countries. Revell's design consists of twin towers surrounding a white disk-like council chamber which is mounted on a raised platform, with entrances located below that are open to the public. There is also a ramp from the square that connects to the podium green roof and also leads to the council chamber. The two towers are of unequal height as the east tower is taller than the west. The City Hall is nicknamed "The Eye of the Government" because it resembles a large eye in a plan view. Revell died a year before the New City Hall was completed.

John Rodgers (July 11, 1772 – August 1, 1838) was a senior naval officer in the United States Navy who served under six Presidents for nearly four decades during its formative years in the 1790s through the late 1830s, committing the bulk of his adult life to his country.  His service took him through many operations in the Quasi-War with France, both Barbary Wars in North Africa and the War of 1812 with Britain. As a senior officer in the young American navy he played a major role in the development of the standards, customs and traditions that emerged during this time. Rodgers was, among other things, noted for commanding the largest American squadron in his day to sail the Mediterranean Sea.Paullin, 1910 p.9Hagan, 1992 pp.60-61 After serving  with distinction as a lieutenant he was soon promoted directly to the rank of captain (the rank of Master Commandant did not exist at that time).McKee, Christopher (1991), A Gentlemanly and Honorable Profession: The Creation of the U.S. Naval Officer Corps, 1794-1815, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD. pp 297  During his naval career he commanded a number of warships, including the USS John Adams, the flagship of the fleet that defeated the Barbary states of North Africa. During the War of 1812 Rodgers fired the first shot of the war aboard his next flagship, the USS President, and also played a leading role in the recapture of Washington after the capital was burned by the British, while also having to endure his own hometown and house burned and his family displaced. Later in his career he headed the Navy Board of Commissioners and served briefly as Secretary of the Navy.Paullin, 1910 p.325 Following in his footsteps, Rodgers' son and several grandsons and great-grandsons also became commodores and admirals in the United States Navy.Paullin, 1910 pp.74, 382, 402-403

The Genesis series of locomotives was designed by General Electric in response to a specification published by Amtrak and ultimately selected over a competing design presented by GM EMD.  The Genesis series are unique among current North American diesel-electric locomotives because of their low height.  This height restriction allowed the locomotive to travel easily through low-profile tunnels in the Northeast Corridor.

Leiden Observatory (Sterrewacht Leiden in Dutch) is an astronomical observatory in the city of Leiden, the Netherlands. It was established by Leiden University in 1633, to house the quadrant of Snellius, and is the oldest operating University observatory in the world (before this, astronomy taught at medieval universities tended to be of a more theoretical nature, and any observations were usually done with private equipment rather than at University observatories —see this timeline).
The original observatory used observing platforms on the roof of the main university building
at the Rapenburg. In 1860 a large, modern observatory was erected at the Witte Singel. This
building was the home of the astronomy department until it moved to the science campus north-west
of the city centre in 1974. Although professional astronomical observations are no longer carried out from Leiden itself, the department still calls itself Leiden Observatory. Today's astronomers instead travel to the big observatories, e.g. ESO's VLT in Chile.
The astronomy department (Sterrewacht Leiden) is the largest in the Netherlands and is internationally renowned, performing research in a wide range of astronomical disciplines.
A number of prominent astronomers and physicists have done work at Leiden Observatory, including Willem de Sitter, Ejnar Hertzsprung, and Jan Oort, all of whom have served as Directors. Another famous employee was Jacobus Kapteyn.

CATEGORIES: Beaches of Oahu, Visitor attractions in Honolulu, Hawaii, Parks in Hawaii, Protected areas of Oahu

Ala Moana Beach Park  is a free public park on the island of Oahu, U.S. state of Hawaii, located between Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. This [tpl]convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] park has a wide gold-sand beach that is over a half-mile (800 m) long. It is man-made and was created by the owner of the Dillingham Dredging Company, who was looking for a place to dispose of his dredged earth. So in the 1950s, sand was dumped at this park, which created the beach.
The water is almost always calm because the beach is protected by an outer reef. This makes it a good spot for long-distance swimmers and small children. There is a [tpl]convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep[/tpl] swimming channel and a former boat channel that was dredged out of the reef.
Ala Moana's ocean bottom drops quickly, so novice swimmers should use caution. Big grassy areas, banyans and palm trees make the park a good place to picnic, barbecue, play all kinds of ball games or go running. There are lifeguards, showers, restrooms, phones, tennis courts, picnic tables, food concessions and a music pavilion. Ala Moana Beach Park is a favorite among Honolulu residents. On the weekends, they come here with their whole ohana (family) to picnic, swim and spend time together.  It is right next to "Magic Island" where many cultural events are held.

[[Arabic phonology]]
CATEGORIES: Arabic language, Language phonologies

While many languages have numerous dialects that differ in phonology, the contemporary spoken Arabic language is more properly described as a continuum of varieties.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Kirchhoff|Vergyri|2005|p=38[/tpl]  This article deals primarily with Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the standard variety shared by educated speakers throughout Arabic-speaking regions. MSA is used in writing in formal print media and orally in newscasts, speeches and formal declarations of numerous types.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Kirchhoff|Vergyri|2005|pp=38–39[/tpl]
Arabic has 28 consonant phonemes, making phonemic contrasts between "emphatic" (pharyngealized or velarized) consonants and non-emphatic ones; Arabic also has three vowel phonemes. However, by the 8th century, the letter alif no longer represented a glottal stop only, but also a long [tpl]IPA|/aː/[/tpl]. As a result, a diacritic symbol, hamza ([tpl]lang|ar|ء[/tpl]),[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] was introduced to represent this sound with alif, and a hamza can be used, separately, now without the letter alif, to indicate the sound. In addition, some of these phonemes have coalesced in the various modern dialects, while new phonemes have been introduced through borrowing or phonemic splits. A "phonemic quality of length" applies to consonants as well as vowels.[tpl]Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=57[/tpl]

The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority [tpl]UnitedStatesCode|10|3013[/tpl] to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President.
The Secretary of the Army is a civilian official appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Army, who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other senior officials of the Department are the Under Secretary of the Army (principal deputy to the Secretary) and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (principal deputy to the Chief of Staff.)
The Department of War was originally formed in 1789 as an Executive Department of the United States, and was renamed by the National Security Act of 1947 to the Department of the Army on September 18, 1947. By amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 in 1949, the Department of the Army was transformed to its present-day status.

[[Canadian federal election, 1935]]
CATEGORIES: 1935 elections in Canada, Canadian federal elections by year

The Canadian federal election of 1935 was held on October 14, 1935 to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 18th Parliament of Canada. The Liberal Party of William Lyon Mackenzie King won a majority government, defeating Prime Minister R.B. Bennett's Conservative Party.  
The central issue was the economy, which was still in the depths of the Great Depression. Bennett, in office since the 1930 election, had done little to stimulate the economy during his first few years, believing that a policy of high tariffs and trade within the British Empire would correct the depression.  In the last months of his time in office, he reversed his position, however, copying the popular New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the United States.  Upset about high unemployment and inaction by the federal government, voters were unwilling to allow the Conservatives to continue to govern, despite their change of policy. 
The Conservatives were also suffering severe internal divisions.  During his first years in office, Bennett had alienated those in his party who supported intervention in the economy.  His last minute conversion to interventionism alienated the rest of the party. Former cabinet minister H.H. Stevens left to form the Reconstruction Party.  Senior minister Sir Joseph Flavelle announced he would be supporting the Liberals.
Voters opted for Mackenzie King's promise of mild reforms to restore economic health.  The Liberals crushed the Tories, winning 171 seats to the Conservatives' 39, the worst ever performance by the Tories until their collapse in 1993. The Liberal Party would continue to hold power until 1957.
The 1935 election was also important in it saw the final demise of the Progressive Party and the United Farmers of Alberta.  Two new movements rose out of the west, however.  The new Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a social democratic party, first competed in this election and won seven seats, promising social reform.  The Social Credit Party of Canada was even more successful, capturing seventeen seats on its platform of monetary reform despite winning less of the popular vote than the former.

The [tpl]Nihongo|Kempeitai|憲兵隊|Kenpeitai|"Military Police Corps"[/tpl] was the military police arm of the Imperial Japanese Army from 1881 to 1945. It was not a conventional military police, but more of a secret police like Nazi Germany's Gestapo. Therefore, while it was institutionally part of the Imperial Japanese Army, it also discharged the functions of the military police for the Imperial Japanese Navy under the direction of the Admiralty Minister (although the IJN had its own much smaller Tokkeitai), those of the executive police under the direction of the Interior Minister, and those of the judicial police under the direction of the Justice Minister. A member of the corps was called a kempei.Masae Takahashi (editor and annotator), Zoku Gendaishi Shiryo ("Materials on Contemporary History, Second Series"), Volume 6, Gunji Keisatsu ("Military Police"), (Tokyo: Misuzu Shobo, 1982), pp. v–xxx.

[[Computer cooling]]
CATEGORIES: Computer hardware cooling, Central processing unit

Computer cooling is required to remove the waste heat produced by computer components, to keep components within permissible operating temperature limits.
Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated include integrated circuits such as CPUs, chipset, graphics cards, and hard disk drives.
Components are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use of heatsinks cooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots. Computer fans are widely used along with heatsinks to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also more exotic cooling techniques, such as liquid cooling.
Many computers are designed to sound an alarm or switch off if certain critical internal temperatures exceed a specified limit.
Cooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer e.g. by exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly individually cooled include the CPU, GPU and the northbridge chip.

[[Digital Speech Standard]]
CATEGORIES: Audio codecs, Digital dictation, Speech codecs

Digital Speech Standard (DSS) is a proprietary compressed digital audio file format defined by the  International Voice Association, a co-operative venture by Olympus, Philips and Grundig.  It was originally developed in 1994 by Grundig with the University of Nuremberg.  In 1997, the digital speech standard was released, which was based on the previous codec.  Its is commonly used on digital dictation recorders. 
The DSS file format stores voice audio data in a highly compressed format that allows basic recording functionality (such as recording, playing, rewinding, etc.) as well as the ability to record in either insert or overwrite mode making it ideal for dictation. This along with ability to include additional information in the file header for the transcriptionist including priority mark, author, job type, etc.
DSS is a format designed specifically for speech, equivalent to MP3 for music. In contrast with MP3, however, the quality usually is as low as possible, to minimize the size of the file.

The North-American Interfraternity Conference (or NIC), (formerly known as the National Interfraternity Conference) is an association of collegiate men's fraternities that was formally organized in 1910, although it began on November 27, 1909. The power of the organization rests in a House of Delegates where each member fraternity is represented by a single delegate. However, the group’s executive and administrative powers are vested in an elected board of directors consisting of nine volunteers from various NIC fraternities. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, the NIC also operates a small professional staff.North-American Interfraternity Conference Constitution — Article IV. House of Delegates and V. Board of Directors
The NIC seeks to provide services including, “but not be limited to, promotion of cooperative action in dealing with fraternity matters of mutual concern, research in areas of fraternity operations and procedures, fact-finding and data gathering, and the dissemination of such data to the member fraternities.” However, it notes that “conference action shall not in any way abrogate the right of its member fraternities to self-determination.”North-American Interfraternity Conference Constitution — Article II. Purpose
As of June 2011, the NIC had seventy-five member organizations with 5,500 chapters located on over 800 campuses in the United States and Canada with approximately 350,000 undergraduate members.
Originally named the Interfraternity Conference, the name was changed to the National Interfraternity Conference in 1931. The current name, the North-American Interfraternity Conference, was adopted in 1999 to reflect the organization's affiliations at Canadian colleges and universities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

[[Alai (Ender's Game)]]

CATEGORIES: Ender's Game series characters, Fictional soldiers, Fictional characters introduced in 1985, Characters in American novels of the 20th century, Characters in American novels of the 21st century

Alai (pronounced ah-lie) is a major character in Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card. He appears in the novels Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Giant. He is a Battle School student of African descent.
In Battle School, Alai is an exceptional student, adroit in the battle room, and is one of the first kids to befriend Ender, in one of the early battle room training sessions that they are both a part of. He also helps lead the special launchy training sessions Ender conducts.  These training sessions developed the skills of students in the zero-gravity game that is played at Battle School. This game is designed to teach students military tactics and skills. Alai is considered to be almost as good strategically as Ender is.
However, when Ender becomes commander of Dragon Army, they have a falling-out of sorts. Ender attempts to rekindle the friendship by proposing "salaam" again; but Alai says it is not to be, and tells him of the meaning, which is "peace." Alai is also one of the final eleven commanders, Ender's Jeesh, that lead under Ender's command during the Third Invasion in which the Buggers are eliminated.
In Shadow Puppets, Alai has become a caliph for the Muslim nations: their chief military, political and spiritual leader. He then successfully orchestrates a combined attack against China, removing from China's control both its recent acquisitions in India and the rest of Southern Asia. He also divides up other provinces of China, such as Tibet (independent now), Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia (given to Mongolia).
In Shadow of the Giant, Alai's empire starts to fall apart due to the actions of extremists. He faces a China under the control of Han Tzu, a fellow jeesh member; and India under the control of the Battle School graduate Virlomi, who has declared herself a Hindu Goddess. Alai allies with India by marrying Virlomi, but turmoil leads the extremists and the Indian people to conspire against him. Alai flees his empire after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt. After peace is restored, Alai leaves Earth with the help of the International Fleet to colonize another world.

[[Peak ground acceleration]]
CATEGORIES: Seismology and earthquake terminology, Earthquake engineering

Peak ground acceleration (PGA) is a measure of earthquake acceleration on the ground and an important input parameter for earthquake engineering, also known as the design basis earthquake ground motion (DBEGM)Nuclear Power Plants and Earthquakes, accessed 2011-04-08
Unlike the Richter and moment magnitude scales, it is not a measure of the total energy (magnitude, or size) of an earthquake, but rather of how hard the earth shakes in a given geographic area (the intensity). The Mercalli intensity scale uses personal reports and observations to measure earthquake intensity but PGA is measured by instruments, such as accelerographs, and it generally correlates well with the Mercalli scale.[tpl]cite web|title=ShakeMap Scientific Background. Rapid Instrumental Intensity Maps|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/background.php#intmaps|work=Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=U. S. Geological Survey|accessdate=22 March 2011[/tpl] See also seismic scale.
The peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) is the most commonly used type of ground acceleration in engineering applications, and is used to set building codes and design hazard risks. In an earthquake, damage to buildings and infrastructure is related more closely to ground motion, rather than the magnitude of the earthquake.  For moderate earthquakes, PGA is  the best determinate of damage; in severe earthquakes, damage is more often correlated with peak ground velocity.

M-168 was one of the shortest state trunkline highways in the US state of Michigan, extending [tpl]convert|0.953|mi|km[/tpl] from a junction with M-22 in downtown Elberta to the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks. It followed the south shore of Lake Betsie (formed by the Betsie River before flowing into Lake Michigan). The highway was commissioned in 1931 and served as a connection to the car ferries until 1984. The road was being reconstructed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in preparation to transfer it to village control. That transfer happened on April 24, 2012, and now the former highway is a village street.

Motor Trend is an American automobile magazine. It first appeared in September 1949, issued by Petersen Publishing Company in Los Angeles, and bearing the tag line "The Magazine for a Motoring World".  Petersen Publishing was sold to British publisher EMAP in 1998, who sold the former Petersen magazines to Primedia in 2001. As of 2007, it is published by Source Interlink. It has a monthly circulation of over one million readers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.echo-media.com/MediaDetail.asp?IDNumber=8182 |title=Motor Trend |publisher=Echo Media |date= |accessdate=2011-01-30[/tpl]
One of the earliest and most enduring of the magazine's creations was its Car of the Year award, given almost continuously since its inception, although the phrase itself would not become entrenched until well into the 1950s. The first winner was the 1949 Cadillac; the company turned it down.Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. American Cars 1946-1959 (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.190. The award has gone through several splits and permutations over the years, being called the Golden Wheels Award for a while in the 1970s and having given rise to Truck of the Year and Import Car of the Year as well as SUV of the Year. Nevertheless, it is still coveted by manufacturers and is usually covered by the mainstream press as the most important distinction awarded in the American auto industry.

[[Rule of succession]]
CATEGORIES: Probability assessment, Inductive reasoning

In probability theory, the rule of succession is a formula introduced in the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the course of treating the sunrise problem.Laplace, Pierre-Simon (1814). Essai philosophique sur les probabilités. Paris: Courcier.
The formula is still used, particularly to estimate underlying probabilities when there are few observations, or for events that have not been observed to occur at all in (finite) sample data.  Assigning events a zero probability contravenes Cromwell's rule, which can never be strictly justified in physical situations, albeit sometimes must be assumed in practice.

St Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Saint Gatien to Tours, Saint Trophimus to Arles, Saint Paul to Narbonne, Saint Saturnin to Toulouse, Saint Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Saint Martial to Limoges.

CATEGORIES: 1997 video games, Maxis Sim games, SimCity, Vehicular combat games, Windows games

Streets of SimCity is a 1997 racing and vehicular combat computer game published by Maxis.  One of the game's main attractions was the ability to explore any  city created in SimCity 2000 by car in a cinematic style. The game, like SimCopter, is in full 3D and the player's vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Another notable feature is the game's network mode, in which players can play deathmatches with up to seven other individuals.
Notably, it is one of the few games in the Maxis series that Will Wright did not work on, and the last Maxis game to be developed and released without supervision by Electronic Arts[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/maxis/page9.html | title= SIMply Divine: The story of Maxis Software; page 9: A New Focus, a New Mission | work = Geoff Keighley and GameSpot | accessdate = February 5, 2007 [/tpl] (which acquired Maxis in the two months leading up to release and assisted development of Maxis games thereafter).

Reena Virk (March 10, 1983 – November 14, 1997) was a resident of Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. Her status as a bullying and murder victim attracted substantial media attention in Canada.
Virk was first swarmed by friends. The names of six of the girls involved in the first beating, known collectively as "the Shoreline Six," have not all been released. Following the first beating the boyfriend, Warren Glowatski, and Kelly Ellard murdered Virk. Glowatski was given a life sentence after being convicted of second-degree murder.  Ellard was tried three times. The verdict of her third trial, a conviction, was set aside. The verdict was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled not to hold a fourth trial in an 8-1 decision, upholding the conviction and sentence.
The Globe and Mail commented at the time that her case had been "elevated into a national tragedy.""Reena Virk's short life and lonely death," The Globe and Mail, 27 November 1997 Canadian sociologists have described the case as a watershed moment for a "moral panic" over girl violence by the Canadian public in the late 1990s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Barron|first=Christie|coauthors=Lacombe, Dany|date=1 February 2005|title=Moral panic and the Nasty Girl|journal=The Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology|volume=42|issue=1|page=51|issn=0008-4948[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: 2000 albums, Albums produced by Martin Feveyear, The Presidents of the United States of America (band) albums

Freaked Out and Small is the fourth album by The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released in 2000 by MUSICBLITZ Records, which was a web based label. Copies of the album distributed through MUSICBLITZ included in the liner notes a special thanks to anyone who pre-ordered it from the MUSICBLITZ website. These fans are listed individually, by name.
An interesting note about this album is that all of the songs were played with normal guitars and bass guitars. This is different from all of the other albums by the band, as they usually played with guitbasses and basitars, which were guitars with fewer strings that were tuned differently than usual.
This album was re-released in 2004 on the band's own label, PUSA Inc. with bonus tracks that included 8 of the 12 songs on the album, as well as 2 other songs, as Chris Ballew originally recorded them between 1989 and 1996.

[[Philip of Side]]
CATEGORIES: 5th-century writers, 5th-century Christians, Christian writers, Late-Roman-era Greek historians, Pamphylians

Philip of Side or Philip Sidetes (ca 380 - after 431), a historian of the early Christian church, was born at Side, the ancient Greek Iconium, Pamphylia (the modern Konya, Turkey). He wrote a Christian history of which fragments survive. For some detail he relied upon the well-known Historia Ecclesiae by Eusebius of Caesarea.  
Philip may be the last writer to quote Papias, and is best known for his statement that in the second book of the latter's five book treatise, Papias reported that the Apostle John was "killed by the Jews".  
He studied in Alexandria under Rhodon, and was teaching in Side about 405. Later he was a priest in Constantinople in the close circle of John Chrysostom, and he was a candidate for the patriarchate of Constantinople against Sisinnius (425), Nestorius (428), and Maximianus (431). He seems to have been the same Byzantine presbyter Philip, who was commended by Cyril of Alexandria for avoiding the company of Nestorius, whom Cyril considered heretical. 
Of his numerous books only fragments remain, his history of the Christian church, his polemic against the Emperor Julian.

Maria Weizmann ([tpl]lang-ru|Мари́я Ве́йцман[/tpl]; 1893, Pinsk, Russian Empire (now in Belarus) - ?) was a sister of Israeli politician and notable scientist Chaim Weizmann (the first President of the State of Israel). She graduated from a university in Switzerland and worked as a doctor in Moscow from 1915. 
Maria Weizman and her husband V.M. Savitsky were long denied the right to emigrate from the Soviet Union by the authorities (see also refusenik). Her husband was arrested in 1949. 
On February 10, 1953 she was arrested in connection with the alleged Doctors' plot. Her case was handled by the GRU (as opposed to MGB as it was common), an evidence of its importance to the Soviet regime. After Joseph Stalin's death and the admission by the Soviet leadersip that the "plot" was made up, she was still kept in Lubyanka prison, and released only on August 12, 1953. Weizmann immigrated to Israel in 1956. 
She was officially rehabilitated after Perestroika in 1989.

[[Pranger]]
CATEGORIES: European instruments of torture, Medieval instruments of torture, Physical restraint

The pranger is a German physical punishment device related to the stocks and the pillory. The Middle Low German word means "something that pinches badly".
The pranger chained the victim's neck to a pair of leg restraints fastened around the ankles. Often the chain was short so that the offender was placed in an uncomfortable half-kneeling position.
In another type of pranger (pillory), the condemned person was tied to a column that stood in the town center for public view. The pranger was only used for public humiliation as punishment, not for painful interrogation or coercion.
In German the word was also used for the scold's bridle.

 Antonio de León Pinelo (1589–1660) was a Spanish-colonial historian.
Pinelo was born in Cordova de Tucuman, and educated in the College of the Jesuits of Lima.  He travelled to Spain in 1612 and became attorney of the council of the Indies.  Then, he became judge of the tribunal of La Contratacion in Seville, succeeding Gil Gonzalez Davila in 1658 in the post of historian of the Indies. He died in Seville.
Antonio de Leon Pinelo maintained at great length that Biblical Paradise was situated in America.
The "cedularios" permitted initiating the compiling works, because they provided order to legal texts.  Using those as a base, several Spanish jurists started writing the so-called "summaries", which were extracts of a new law or a mixture of several laws about the same theme.  In this work, one of the first was Diego de Zorrilla, whose work was then revised by Rodrigo de Aguiar and lastly by Antonio de Leon Pinelo, who prepared a new project and in 1628 published the summaries of the 4 first books so they could be revised.

Calvert Vaux (December 20, 1824 – November 19, 1895) was a British-American architect and landscape designer. He is best remembered as the co-designer (with Frederick Law Olmsted), of New York's Central Park.
Little is known about Vaux's childhood and upbringing. He was born in London in 1824, and his father was a doctor. Due to this social standing, his father was able to provide a comfortable income for his family.
Vaux (rhymes with hawks) attended a private primary school until the age of nine. He then trained as an apprentice under London architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. Cottingham was a leader of the Gothic Revival movement. He trained Vaux until the age of twenty-six, and as a result, Vaux became a very skilled draftsman.

George Whitefield Chadwick (November 13, 1854 – April 4, 1931) was an American composer. Along with Horatio Parker, Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, and Edward MacDowell, he was a representative composer of what can be called the New England School of American composers of the late 19th century—the generation before Charles Ives. Chadwick's works are influenced by the Realist movement in the arts, characterized by a down-to-earth depiction of people's lives. Many consider his music to portray a distinctively American style. His works included several operas, three symphonies, five string quartets, tone poems, incidental music, songs and choral anthems. Along with a group of other composers collectively known as the Boston Six, Chadwick was one of those responsible for the first significant body of concert music by composers from the United States. The other five were Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, and Horatio Parker.

Botaurus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae. It has a single representative species in each of North America, Central and South America, Eurasia and Australasia. The two northern species are partially migratory, with many birds moving south to warmer areas in winter.
The four Botaurus bitterns are all large chunky, heavily streaked brown birds which breed in large reedbeds. Almost uniquely for predatory birds, the female rears the young alone.[tpl]cite journal || last= Sibly | first= Richard M, | coauthors= Christopher C. Witt, Natalie A.

[[Lost in the Cosmos]]
CATEGORIES: Satirical books, Cognitive science literature, 1983 books, Farrar, Straus and Giroux books

Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book is a mock self-help book and social satire on the American value of autonomy by Walker Percy.  It was  published in 1983 by Farrar Straus & Giroux.
Organized into roughly four sections that explore ideas of the self, Percy's thesis is that the social ills which plague society are a result of humanity's epic identity crisis. Percy uses semiotic theories (the theories of signs) to argue that human consciousness of the self is unique from all other 'interactions' in the universe in that it is triadic. It requires two sets of dyadic interactions between that of the sign user, the sign, and what the sign stands for in order to be complete. As a result, persons are thrust into the predicament of finding a sign that 'places' themselves.
The book contains numerous essays, quizzes, and "thought experiments" designed to satirize conventional self-help texts while provoking readers to undertake a thoughtful contemplation of their existential situations and the search for meaning and purpose that could derive from such reflections.
The book is a favourite of prominent philosopher Peter Kreeft, of Boston College, and a lecture on the subject appears on his personal website.

[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]
CATEGORIES: 1970s American television series, Western (genre) characters, NBC network shows, Television series about animals, Television series by CBS Paramount Television, Western (genre) television series, 1977 American television series debuts, 1978 American television series endings, 1974 films, 1970s drama films, Paramount Pictures films, English-language television programming

The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams is a 1972 novel by Charles E. Sellier Jr.. There is a 1974 film based on the novel, a two-season NBC television series, and a 1982 TV movie. The title character, played by Dan Haggerty, is loosely based on the actual trapper James "Grizzly" Adams.
Grizzly Adams (Haggerty) is a woodsman during the frontier era who flees into the mountains after he is wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams discovers an orphaned grizzly bear cub whom he takes in and calls Ben. The bear, despite his huge adult size, becomes Adams's closest companion. Adams proves to have an uncanny link to most of the indigenous wildlife of the region, who have no fear of him. In return, he resolves never to harm another animal whenever possible. In the television series, Adams had two human companions, an old trader named Mad Jack the Mountain Man (Denver Pyle, commonly featured with a mule named "Number Seven") and a native American named Nakoma (Don Shanks). Together, they helped various visitors while protecting the wildlife.
The series was concluded with a 1982 TV movie called The Capture of Grizzly Adams where a bounty hunter used Adams's daughter—not seen or mentioned since the 1974 film—to draw him back to civilization. In the end, Adams proved his innocence. NBC aired this 2 hour finale on February 21, 1982.

CATEGORIES: 1981 Atlantic hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1981 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1981, and lasted until November 30, 1981. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin.    The 1981 season was high in activity with 18 tropical depressions and twelve storms forming during the year.  Nine of these systems made landfall.  Cindy, Harvey, and Irene neither affected land directly nor indirectly.
Hurricane Dennis caused millions of dollars in damage in Dade County, Florida and produced the highest rainfall totals of any tropical cyclone this season.  Tropical Depression Eight caused the most damage, due to flooding in Texas at the end of August, and led to most fatalities of any tropical cyclone this season (five).  Tropical Depressions Two and Eight caused a majority of the damage and fatalities this season, with both affecting Louisiana and Texas.  Katrina was the only named storm with associated fatalities.Miles B. Lawrence. Preliminary Report Hurricane Katrina: 3 – November 7, 1981. Retrieved on May 17, 2008.

[[Endopterygota]]
CATEGORIES: Insects

The Endopterygota, also known as Holometabola, are insects of the subclass Pterygota which go through distinctive larval, pupal, and adult stages. They undergo a radical metamorphosis, with the larval and adult stages differing considerably in their structure and behaviour. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.
The Endopterygota are among the most diverse insect superorders, with approximately 850,000 living species divided between eleven orders, containing insects such as butterflies, flies, fleas, bees, ants and beetles.[tpl]cite journal |title=Endopterygote systematics – where do we stand and what is the goal (Hexapoda, Arthropoda)? |author=Rolf G. Beutel & Hans Pohl |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=202–219 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3113.2006.00341.x[/tpl]
They are distinguished from the Exopterygota (or Hemipterodea) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (meaning literally "internal winged forms") develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota ("external winged forms") develop wings on the outside of their bodies and do not go through a pupal stage. The latter trait is plesiomorphic however and not exclusively found in the exopterygotes, but also in groups such as Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) which are not Neoptera but more basal among insects.
The earliest endopterygote fossils date from the Carboniferous.[tpl]cite journal |author=A. Nel, P. Roques, P. Nel, J. Prokop & J. S. Steyer |year=2007 |title=The earliest holometabolous insect from the Carboniferous: a "crucial" innovation with delayed success (Insecta Protomeropina Protomeropidae) |journal=Annales de la Société Entomologique de France |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=349–355[/tpl]

[[1982 Atlantic hurricane season]]
CATEGORIES: 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1982 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1982 and lasted until November 30, 1982, and was a below average season. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. Only six storms formed during this hurricane season: five named storms (this was the record for the smallest number of named cyclones in the Atlantic basin since naming began in 1950, until the following year (1983) when only 4 named storms formed) and an unnamed subtropical storm (no subtropical storms were named between 1974 and 2001). The season only produced two hurricanes (record low since 1944) one of which reached major hurricane status. The season started early with Hurricane Alberto forming on the first day of the season. Alberto threatened the Southwestern Florida coast as a tropical storm, causing twenty-three fatalities in Cuba. The next storm, a subtropical storm, formed in June and affected the same area as Alberto, causing $10 million in damage.
Tropical Storm Beryl formed on August 28, after a quiet July in the open Atlantic Ocean. Beryl grazed Cape Verde, killing 3 people. Tropical Depression Three formed just behind Beryl, tracking east and north of the Caribbean sea in early September. Soon after the dissipation of Beryl, Tropical Storm Chris formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 9. Chris stayed as a weak storm, making landfall near Sabine Pass, Texas and dissipated over land on September 13. Hurricane Debby was the next storm and the strongest of the season. The formative stage of Debby produced rainfall in Puerto Rico and soon strengthened into a Category 4 Major Hurricane. Debby passed by Newfoundland on September 18 and merged with a non-tropical low on September 20. In mid-September, Tropical Depression Six formed west of Africa, and tracked west-northwest, dissipating before reaching the Leeward Islands on September 20. Its remnant thunderstorm activity continued moving west-northwest, forming Tropical Depression Seven which moved near Bermuda on September 25 before dissipating offshore Nova Scotia. The final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Ernesto, was the shortest lasting storm of the season and stayed out to sea, dissipating on October 2.

Espen J. Aarseth is a figure in the fields of video game studies and electronic literature. Aarseth was born in Bergen, Norway, in 1965 and completed his doctorate at the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Bergen. He co-founded the Department of Humanistic Informatics http://huminf.uib.no/[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl] at the University of Bergen, and worked there until 2003, at which time he was a full professor. He is currently Principal Researcher at the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen.
Aarseth's works include groundbreaking Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature (Johns Hopkins UP 1997) book, which was originally his doctoral thesis. Cybertext focuses on mechanical organization of texts by placing the medium as a critical part of literary exchanges. The book introduces the concept of ergodic literature, which is a text that requires non-trivial effort to be traversed. The book also contains a well-known (pre-ludological) theory, "typology of cybertext" which allows ergodic texts to be classified by their functional qualities. (In Aarseth's later work with Solveig Smedstad & Lise Sunnanå this typology of cybertext transforms into "a multi-dimensional typology of games".)
Aarseth also wrote an article, "Nonlinearity and Literary Theory", which was published in Hyper/Text/Theory and The New Media Reader.  The article discusses the concept behind nonlinear texts, stepping away from the category of hypertext and delving into different types of media which can also be considered nonlinear.  He identifies nonlinear texts as objects of verbal communication in which the words or sequence of words may differ from reading to reading.  He also outlines the different categories and varieties of nonlinear texts. Additionally, he talks about how writing is more than just signs and symbols. Writing can be broken down into two units which are called textons and scriptons. The essay also discusses hypertext fiction in depth as well as works of interactive fiction, such as Adventure, and MUDs.
Aarseth is now the Editor in Chief of Game Studies,http://gamestudies.org/1103/ed_board Editorial Board for the Game Studies journal a preeminent ludological journal, and member of the Advisory Board of G|A|M|E,http://www.gamejournal.it/about/editorial-board/ Editorial Board for the G|A|M|E journal a journal of comparative videogame analysis.

[[Guild Wars]]

CATEGORIES: Guild Wars, 2005 MMORPGs, Video game franchises introduced in 2005

Guild Wars is a competitive online role-playing game developed by ArenaNet and published by NCsoft. Because it deviated from traditional MMORPG norms in a number of areas, like instancing all the gameplay areas, and that it focused more on player vs. player (PvP) than most online RPGs, it was marketed as competitive online role-playing game.[tpl]cite web|title=Guild Wars|url=http://www.guildwars.com/products/guildwars/features/default.php|publisher=NCSoft|author=ArenaNet|date=2005-07-05|accessdate=2009-09-01[/tpl] It provides two main modes of gameplay—a cooperative role-playing component and a competitive PvP component—both of which are hosted on ArenaNet's servers. Three stand-alone episodes, one major expansion pack, and several "mini"-expansions were released in the series from April 2005 to April 2013.
The games depict the history of the fictional fantasy world of Tyria; each campaign focuses on events in disjointed sections of the world at roughly the same time. A player creates an avatar to play through the cooperative storyline of a campaign, taking on the role of a hero who must save Tyria from episode-specific antagonists. Players can group with other players and non-player characters, known as henchmen and heroes, to perform missions and quests found throughout the game-world. PvP combat is consensual, team based, and limited to areas designed for such combat. Players are allowed to create characters at maximum level and with the best equipment specifically for PvP play, which is unusual for MMORPGs.[tpl]cite web|title=Guild Wars|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=119730|publisher=Computer and Video Games|author=PC Zone Staff|date=2005-06-10|accessdate=2007-10-08[/tpl] ArenaNet hosts official Guild Wars tournaments where the most successful players and guilds may compete for the chance to play live at gaming conventions and win prizes up to US$100,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guildwars.com/competitive/gwwc/worldchampionship-rules.php|title=Guild Wars World Championship rules|author=ArenaNet|accessdate=2007-02-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://guildwars.com/competitive/gwfc/gwfc06-rules.php|title=Guild Wars Factions Championship rules|author=ArenaNet|accessdate=2007-02-28[/tpl]
Guild Wars differs from some of the other MMORPGs in its lack of subscription fees (purchasing an episode allows a user to play it online without limit, though he or she may encounter some areas or items which cannot be obtained without purchasing other expansions) and relatively low level caps. After reaching the level cap, players differentiate their characters by which skills they equip to bring into battle; new skills can be learned by exploring and completing quests.  Only eight of a player's learned skills can be equipped at any one time, the ongoing challenge being to select skills that synergize well in the next combat environment.
The games in the Guild Wars series were critically well received[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/guildwars|title=Guild Wars (pc: 2005): Reviews[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/guildwarsfactions|title=Guild Wars Factions (pc: 2006): Reviews[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Guild Wars Nightfall (pc: 2006): Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/guildwarsnightfall[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Game Rankings — Search — Guild Wars|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/itemsearch.asp?itemname=Guild%20Wars[/tpl] and won many editor's choice awards, as well as awards such as Best Value, Best Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), and Best Game.[tpl]cite web|title=Press: Awards|url=http://www.guildwars.com/events/press/awards/[/tpl] Guild Wars was noted for being one of the few commercially developed games in the MMORPG genre to offer online play without subscription fees,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/play.html?pg=6|title=Wired 13.02 PLAY[/tpl] its instanced approach to MMORPG play,[tpl]cite web |title=Guild Wars|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=59083|publisher=Eurogamer|first=Kieron|last=Gillen|date=2005-05-16|accessdate=2007-10-08[/tpl] and the quality of the graphics and play for computers with low specifications.[tpl]cite web|title=Guild Wars|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/guild-wars/613203p4.html|publisher=GameSpy|author=Dave Kosak and Miguel Lopez|date=2005-04-26|accessdate=2007-10-08[/tpl] In April 2009, NCSoft announced that 6 million units of games in the Guild Wars series had been sold.[tpl]cite web|title=Guildwars.com Press Release, Guild Wars Surpasses Six Million Units Sold|url=http://www.guildwars.com/events/press/releases/pressrelease-2009-04-24.php[/tpl].

[[XV International AIDS Conference, 2004]]
CATEGORIES: 2004 in politics, 2004 conferences, International AIDS Conferences, International conferences in Thailand, 2004 in Thailand, History of Bangkok

The XV International AIDS Conference was held in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, from July 11 to July 16, 2004. The main venue for the conference was the IMPACT Muang Thong Thani convention centre at Nonthaburi, north-east of downtown Bangkok. It was the first international AIDS conference to be held in Southeast Asia. International AIDS conferences have been held regularly since the first one in Atlanta in 1985.
At the opening ceremony on the evening of July 11, the main speakers were the Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. The opening was screened live on Thai national television.
Thaksin, whose government had been criticised by foreign observers for its harsh attitude to injecting drug users, surprised the conference by pledging to adopt a "harm minimization" approach to AIDS prevention among drug users, and to work co-operatively with non-government organizations, including the Thai Drug Users' Network. AIDS activists suggested that Thaksin had been promised greatly increased funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria if he adopted a more flexible attitude.
Annan, in a forceful speech, praised Thaksin and also the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who was seated in the front row, for their leadership in developing strategies for fighting AIDS in developing countries. But he said that much more was needed, including a radical change in attitudes to women in many countries, since HIV infection is now increasing more rapidly among young women in developing countries that in any other population group. Annan said the empowerment of women, particularly in African and Asian countries, was the key to preventing the further spread of HIV infection.
The conference was attended by more than 20,000 delegates and a large contingent of local and international media. Many people with HIV/AIDS and delegates from developing countries were subsidized to attend the conference by governments, the United Nations, other international organizations and drug companies.
The United States, however, significantly reduced its official presence at the conference as compared to previous conferences. The Department of Health and Human Services, which spent US$3.6 million to sent 236 people to the XIV International AIDS Conference in Barcelona in 2002, spend US$500,000 and sent only 50. The move was seen as a response to events in Barcelona, when Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson was shouted down by protestors.
The co-chairs of the conference were Dr. Vallop Thaineua of Thailand and Joep Lange of the Netherlands, president of the International AIDS Society, which was the formal host organization. The content of the conference was run by three program committees, the Community Program Committee, chaired by Senator Mechai Viravaidya and Donald De Gagne, the Scientific Program Committee chaired by Professor Prasert Thongcharoen and Professor David Cooper, and the Leadership Program Committee chaired by Pakdee Pothisiri and Debrework Zewdie. 
The Leadership Program section of the Conference was, however, thrown into doubt by security concerns. On July 7 the Thai government cancelled a meeting on HIV/AIDS for national leaders planned as part of the conference. The leaders of 13 countries and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan were invited to the summit, which was to be hosted by Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, but only one national leader and Annan accepted.
As at previous international AIDS conferences, both local and international organizations staged protests about various aspects of HIV/AIDS policy at the Bangkok conference. Activists protested during the opening of the conference to call attention to what they said were failures by governments worldwide in fighting AIDS. Tight security prevented any disruption to the ceremony, although Prime Minister Thaksin was heckled during his speech by some sections of the audience.
The protests were co-ordinated by Thailand's AIDS Access Foundation. They called for increased worldwide access to antiretroviral treatments and greater financial support for treatment and prevention. Activists said that the United States and other Western nations were backtracking on funding pledges made at the Barcelona conference.

[[1983 Atlantic hurricane season]]
CATEGORIES: 1983 Atlantic hurricane season, Articles which contain graphical timelines

The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season in 53 years, during which only four tropical storms formed.  The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983.  These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900.

[[River Torrens]]
CATEGORIES: Physiographic sections, Rivers of Adelaide, Adelaide Plains

The River Torrens [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒr|ən|z[/tpl] is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows [tpl]convert|85|km|mi|0[/tpl] from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city.
At its 1836 discovery an inland bend was chosen as the site of the Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide. The river is named after Colonel Robert Torrens, chairman of the colonial commissioners and a significant figure in the city's founding. The river is also known by its native Kaurna name Karra wirra-parri. The river and its tributaries are highly variable in flow, and together drain an area of [tpl]convert|508|km2|mi2|0[/tpl].  They range from sometimes raging torrents, damaging bridges and flooding city areas, to trickles and completely dry in summer.  Winter and spring flooding has prompted the construction of flood reduction works. A constructed sea outlet, landscaped linear parks and three holding reservoirs contain peak flow.
The river's flora and fauna have been both deliberately and accidentally impacted since settlement. In the 19th century, native forests were cleared, gravel removed for construction and many foreign species introduced. With construction of the linear parks, many species native to the river have been replanted, and introduced species have been controlled as weeds. Since European settlement the river has been a frequently touted tourist attraction. During the early years of settlement, the river acted as both the city’s primary water source and main sewer, leading to outbreaks of typhus and cholera.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.cwmb.sa.gov.au/kwc/section1/1-33.htm |title=A LITTLE CATCHMENT HISTORY | accessdate =21 November 2006 | author= KESAB |publisher=Catchment Boards of South Australia[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2009[/tpl] New site: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au Active on 9 September 2009.

[[Washington Mean Time]]

CATEGORIES: Time zones, Time in the United States

Washington Mean Time was the time at the meridian through the center of the old dome atop the main building at the old US Naval Observatory at Washington, D.C.  This Washington meridian was defined on 28 September 1850 by the United States Congress.9 Stat. 515 The Old Naval Observatory is now on the grounds of the United States Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, southwest of the corner of E and 23rd Streets in Foggy Bottom (north of the Lincoln Memorial). Washington Mean Time was sometimes called Washington Meridian Time. It was never used as the basis of any time zone, although it was the local mean time of the city of Washington before the advent of American time zones on 18 November 1883. It was also used to time astronomical events by users of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, first published for the year 1855.
In 1897, well after the Old Naval Observatory closed in 1892, the Coast and Geodetic Survey reported that its meridian was 77°3′2.3″ west of Greenwich,3618 Serial Set 254 which was quoted for the next 50 years in the list of observatories in the Almanac as [tpl]nowrap|GMT − 5[tpl]sup|h[/tpl]8[tpl]sup|m[/tpl]12.15[tpl]sup|s[/tpl][/tpl]. This old Washington meridian was repealed on 22 August 1912.37 Stat. 342 A later version of Washington mean time based on the merdian of the clock room at the exact center of the New Naval Observatory (77°4′2.24″W or [tpl]nowrap|GMT − 5[tpl]sup|h[/tpl]8[tpl]sup|m[/tpl]16.15[tpl]sup|s[/tpl][/tpl]) was still being used in 1950 on a few pages of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, even though most of its pages used Greenwich Civil Time, the American name for the midnight epoch Greenwich Mean Time. For astronomical purposes, before 1925 a day was considered to start at noon rather than the previous midnight.  Thus to convert times of astronomical events before 1925 given in Washington mean time to modern Universal Time it is necessary to add an additional 12 hours beyond the meridian difference from Washington to Greenwich, totalling more than 17 hours.

The city has a history of over 3,000 years starting with the Mahamegha-bahana Chedi dynasty (around the 2nd century BCE) which had its capital at Sisupalgarh, nearby. Bhubaneswar, derived its name from Tribhubaneswar, which literally means the Lord (Eeswar) of the Three World (Tribhuban), which refers to Shiva.[tpl]cite book|last=Kalia|first=Ravi|title=Bhubaneswar: From a Temple Town to a Capital City|year=1994|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=9780809318766|pages=3[/tpl] Bhubaneswar has been known by names such as Toshali, Kalinga Nagari, Nagar Kalinga, Ekamra Kanan, Ekamra Kshetra and Mandira Malini Nagari ([tpl]lang-en|"City of Temples"[/tpl]).

Bhubaneswar replaced Cuttack as the capital in 1948, the year after India gained its independence from Britain. The modern city was designed by the German architect Otto Königsberger in 1946. Along with Jamshedpur and Chandigarh, it was one of modern India's first planned cities. Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are often referred to as the twin-cities of Odisha. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities had a population of 1.4 million in 2011.Preface of the Comprehensive Development Plan for the Bhubaneswar-Cuttack Urban Complex Bhubaneswar is categorized as a Tier-2 city.

[[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C]]

CATEGORIES: Wärtsilä, Two-stroke diesel engines, Marine diesel engines

The Wärtsilä RT-flex96C is a two-stroke turbocharged low-speed diesel engine designed by the Finnish manufacturer Wärtsilä.  It is designed for large container ships that run on heavy fuel oil.  Its largest 14-cylinder version is [tpl]convert|13.5|m|0|lk=on[/tpl] high, [tpl]convert|26.59|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, weighs over 2,300 tonnes, and produces [tpl]convert|80080|kW[/tpl].  The engine is currently considered the largest reciprocating engine in the world.
The 14-cylinder version was put into service in September 2006 aboard the Emma Mærsk.[tpl]cite press release|title=The world's most powerful Engine enters service|publisher=Wärtsilä Corporation|date=2006-09-12|url=http://www.wartsila.com/en/press-releases/worlds-most-powerful-engine-enters-service[/tpl]  The design is based on the older RTA96C engine,[tpl]cite press release|title=Increased power for the Sulzer RTA96C|date=2001-03-15|publisher=MarineLink.com|url=http://www.marinelink.com/news/article/increased-power-for-the-sulzer-rta96c/318576.aspx[/tpl] but common rail technology has done away with the traditional camshaft, chain gear, fuel pumps and hydraulic actuators.  The result is better performance at low revolutions per minute (rpm), lower fuel consumption, and lower harmful emissions.
The engine has crosshead bearings so that the always-vertical piston rod allows a tight seal under the piston. Consequently, the lubrication of the engine is split: the cylinders and the crankcase use different lubricants, each being specialised for and dedicated to its role. The cylinders are lubricated by continual, timed injection of consumable lubricant, formulated to protect the cylinders from wear and to neutralise the acids formed during combustion of the high-sulfur fuels commonly used. The crosshead design reduces sideways forces on the piston, keeping diametral cylinder liner wear in the order of only about 0.03 mm per 1000 hours.Hanlon, Mike. Most powerful diesel engine in the world GizMag. Accessed: 24 February 2011.
The descending piston is used to compress incoming combustion air for the adjacent cylinders which also serves to cushion the piston as it approaches bottom dead centre (BDC) to remove some load from the bearings. The engine is uniflow-scavenged by way of exhaust valves that are operated by electronically-controlled, common-rail hydraulics, thus eliminating the camshaft.
As of 2006, more than 300 RT-flex96C engines and older RTA96C engines were in service or on order.
