CATEGORIES: Populated places in New Zealand, Suburbs of Dunedin, Mosgiel

Mosgiel [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|z|ɡ|iː|l[/tpl] is an urban satellite of Dunedin in Otago, New Zealand,[tpl]LINZ|13084||2009-02-01[/tpl] fifteen kilometres west of the city's centre. Since the re-organisation of New Zealand local government in 1989 it has been inside the Dunedin City Council area,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.dunedin.govt.nz/your-council/dunedin-history/dcc-history/mergers |title=Mergers enlarge city boundaries |publisher=Dunedin City Council |accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] but was physically separate from the contiguous suburbs until developments in the neighbouring suburb of Fairfield joined it to the city. Mosgiel has a population of approximately 10,000.Four census districts cover the Mosgiel area. The combined population of "Mosgiel East", "Mosgiel South", "East Taieri" and "Bush Road" was 10,497 in the 2006 census.[tpl]NZ Quickstats|3606100|Mosgiel East[/tpl] [tpl]NZ Quickstats|3606210|Mosgiel South[/tpl] [tpl]NZ Quickstats|3606220|East Taieri[/tpl] [tpl]NZ Quickstats|3606300|Bush Road[/tpl]
Mosgiel stands at the north-eastern extremity of the Taieri Plains. The Silver Stream, a tributary of the Taieri River, runs through its north end. The town celebrates its location, calling itself "The pearl of the plain". Its low-lying nature does pose problems, making it prone to flooding after heavy rains.
The place takes its name from Mossgiel in Ayrshire, the farm of the poet Robert Burns, the uncle of the co-founder in 1848 of the Otago settlement, the Reverend Thomas Burns. A popular, though probably apocryphal, local theory is that the extra "s" was dropped at a time when the cost of telegrams was calculated by the number of characters. The name of the Dunedin suburb of Roslyn (named for Rosslyn in Scotland) is similarly truncated. These two places were sites of major woollen mills - as was the town of Milton [tpl]convert|40|km|mi[/tpl] to the south, where name may originally have been Milltown. Whether there is any connection between the location of the mills and name truncation, or whether it is a mere coincidence, is unknown.
Between Mosgiel and the centre of Dunedin stand the rugged Three Mile Hill and Scroggs Hill, which form part of the crater-wall of a long-extinct volcano, the crater being the Otago Harbour. To the south of the town lies one of the many peaks that formed part of the volcano: Saddle Hill, a prominent landmark, visible from a considerable distance and notable for its distinctive shape, lies east of State Highway One where Kinmont Park, a new housing subdivision is located at the foot of the hill.
The Dunedin Southern Motorway, upgraded in 2003, links Mosgiel with the centre of Dunedin. State Highway 87 to Kyeburn starts at a junction with State Highway 1 at the southeastern edge of Mosgiel, the first part of the highway being the main street of Mosgiel, Gordon Road.

[[White-billed Buffalo Weaver]]

CATEGORIES: Bubalornis, Birds of Africa, Birds of Cameroon

The White-billed Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) is a resident breeding bird species in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert.
This common weaver occurs in open country, especially cultivation and scrub. It is a communal breeder, building massive untidy stick nests in tree colonies, each of which may have several spherical woven nests within. Two to four eggs are laid.
The White-billed Buffalo Weaver is large and stocky, commonly measuring 23 to 24 centimeters[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]. The adult is mainly black with white flecking on the back and wings. The conical bill is very thick, and appears more so because it is surmounted by a white frontal shield. The bill is white in breeding males.
The adult female and non-breeding male are similar, but the bill is black. Young birds are dark brown in plumage.
The White-billed Buffalo Weaver is a gregarious species which feeds on grain and insects. This is a noisy bird, especially in colonies, with a range of cackles and squeaks.

CATEGORIES: Canadian federal elections by year, 1874 elections in Canada

The Canadian federal election of 1874 was held on January 22, 1874, to elect members  of the Canadian House of Commons of the 3rd Parliament of Canada.  Sir John A. Macdonald, who had recently been forced out of office as prime minister, and his Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party under their new leader Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie.
Macdonald's government had been forced to resign on November 5, 1873 because of allegations of corruption relating to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (see the Pacific Scandal).  The Liberals under Mackenzie formed a government two days later with an election called for January. The Tories were unable to recover from the scandal and lost the election as a result. 
The election was the first to occur following Prince Edward Island's entry into Confederation, and the first to use secret ballots in Canada.

[[Viscoelasticity]]

CATEGORIES: Materials science, Elasticity (physics), Non-Newtonian fluids, Continuum mechanics, Rubber properties

Viscoelasticity is the property of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like honey, resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic materials strain when stretched and quickly return to their original state once the stress is removed. Viscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and, as such, exhibit time-dependent strain. Whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid, viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.Meyers and Chawla (1999): "Mechanical Behavior of Materials", 98-103.

[[Knife play]]

CATEGORIES: BDSM terminology

Knife play is form of consensual BDSM edgeplay involving knives, daggers, and swords as a source of physical and mental stimulation. Knives are typically used to cut away clothing, scratch the skin, remove wax after wax play, or simply provide sensual stimulation. Knife play can also be a form of temperature play or body modification.
Knife play is sometimes, but not always, a form of fear play. The "victim" in some cases, is shown a sharp implement, and then blindfolded, and a blunt knife used on their skin (for example: the practice of insertive sex play without the certain knowledge of the submissive that an exchange of implements—blunt for sharp—has occurred. This is a form of fear play, yet it still maintains some degree of safety).
For some, knifeplay can be highly erotic, as the physical and psychological reactions can be intense. It is also an activity that takes a great amount of care to learn properly. As with any sort of edge play that can potentially draw blood, there is the risk of passing diseases along. Also, there is the risk of cutting the wrong spot and causing excessive blood loss, or accidental stabbing.

The Venezuelan presidential  election of 1998, was held on December 6, 1998, to elect the new president of the country. The main candidates were Hugo Chávez, a career military officer who led a coup d'état against then-president Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992; and former Carabobo Governor Henrique Salas Römer. Both candidates represented newly formed parties, a first in a country where the main candidates always represented the parties of the Punto Fijo Pact. Chávez represented MVR, while Salas Römer represented Project Venezuela. Initially weak in the polls, Chávez ran on an anti-corruption and anti-poverty platform, condemning the two major parties that had dominated Venezuelan politics since 1958; and began to gain ground in the polls after the previous front runners faded. Despite the fact that the major parties (COPEI and Democratic Action) endorsed Salas Römer, in the end it was not enough, and Chávez won in a landslide. Chávez was elected to his first term as President of Venezuela with the largest percentage of the popular vote (56.2%) since 1983, when Jaime Lusinchi won with 58.4% of the vote. 
Arguably a realigning election, it meant the end of the Puntofijismo that had dominated the political atmosphere of the country in the last 40 years, and the beginning of the dominance of the new MVR party (later renamed PSUV). After Chávez's election, the opposition would never be able to defeat him in a presidential election, and would only win one referendum in the rest of Chavez's lifetime. As of 2013, the PSUV holds 98 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly, and controls 20 of the 23 governorships.

[[Last-call return]]

CATEGORIES: Teletraffic, Telephone service enhanced features, Calling features

Last-call return, also known as call return, is a telephony feature offered by telephone service providers to give a called party the time and telephone number of the last received call, and may also offer the facility to place a call back to the calling party.
The feature is typically listed as "Last Call Return" or "Call Return", particularly in communication companies' publications. The general public tends to refer to the service by the telephone feature code, the telephone number it has in their country; for example, in the UK it is called "1471".

The access number for this facility varies per country and provider:
In the UK, after dialing "1471", the caller can press "3" to automatically return the call. Until August 2004, this service was free; since that date it has incurred a charge, as of 10 January 2007 a per call fee of 10.5 pence is charged. This has since risen to 17.7 pence.
The service provider may also offer a facility through which the calling party can prevent their number being revealed to the called party, either permanently or on a per-call basis. This is achieved by prefixing the dialed number with:
Conversely, to send the caller number on a line where the number is normally withheld, the following prefixes can be dialed:
In Gibraltar and formerly in Ireland, ex-directory or unlisted numbers are withheld by default.
In Germany, most contemporary telephones have a specific button functioning as call return, which is an internal function of the telephone itself (the number of the last caller is stored inside the phone at the time of that last call) and thus doesn't have a numeric code.
In Canada, the feature is commonly marketed by telephone companies as a combination of two features:

[[Sensual play]]
CATEGORIES: Perception, Sensory systems, Sexual acts, Massage

Sensual play is a generic term which refers to a variety of forms of sensual play. It must be understood that sensual, as referred here, does not mean (or relate to) only sexual appeal.
This comprehension can be extracted of etymological and semantic issues. For what, lato sensu, "sensual" is all that reports to a sense — all and everyone existing in human life. So that "sensual play", also sensual touch, means all forms of sense-playing or sense-touching one that can recognize, say, "sense" it. This most extensive comprehension, furthermore, includes all living things, not only or exclusively human being.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]
Pointed in this manner, the denotative versus connotative meaning of the term, expression or word, stands up for saying: the above generic comprehension seems to be useful; in fact shows it by bonding or joining several apparently non-consensual meanings.
Despite of this, however, the most frequent or usual, current comprehension claims to "sexual play" or "sexual touch", more when referring to or related to human experiences, say senses.
The term may include forms of pain play for those who like pain but more often the term is used to refer to more subtle sensations. Sensual play can include feathers, tickling, temperature play including wax play and ice play, food play, light caresses, very light flogging or spanking, sensual massage, drumming fingers, sensory deprivation, soft music, candlelight, and a variety of other things which stimulate our tactile, heat, cold, auditory, olfactory, and visual neuroreceptors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]

Ascetical theology is the organized study or presentation of spiritual teachings found in Christian Scripture and the Church Fathers that help the faithful to more perfectly follow Christ and attain to Christian perfection. The word ascetic is from the Greek word ἄσκησις askesis,Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon meaning practice. The English term ascesis means "the practice of self-discipline".OED Christian asceticism is commonly thought to imply self-denial for a spiritual purpose. The term ascetical theology is used primarily in Catholic theology; the Eastern Orthodox use distinct terms (see below) and other religious traditions conceive of following Christ or God differently from either Catholics or Eastern Orthodox (see below).

[[List of Leaders of the Official Opposition (Canada)]]
CATEGORIES: Lists of office-holders in Canada, Leaders of the Opposition (Canada), Lists of Canadian politicians, Opposition leaders

This is a List of Canadian Leaders of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is usually the leader of the party with the second-most seats in the Canadian House of Commons, known as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. He or she is entitled to the same levels of pay and protection as a Cabinet Minister, and is often made a member of the Canadian Privy Council, generally the only non-government member of the House of Commons afforded that privilege.
If the leader of the opposition party is not a Member of Parliament, then a sitting MP takes the role of acting Leader of the Opposition until the party leader can obtain a seat. If there is a leadership race occurring within the party, an MP (usually the interim party leader) will serve as Leader of the Opposition until a new party leader is chosen.
The current Leader of the Opposition is Thomas Mulcair, the leader of the New Democratic Party. He is the 44th person to serve in this position, in the 56th term, since 1873. Nine of the previous officeholders only served as an acting Leader of the Opposition, including Deborah Grey (the first of two women to hold the position) making Mulcair the 35th permanent Leader of the Opposition. The title has been held without vacancy since 1948.
Two Leaders of the Opposition have died in office: Wilfrid Laurier in 1919 and Jack Layton in 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=McGregor|first=Janyce|title=Parliament and Layton's passing|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/inside-politics-blog/2011/08/parliament-and-laytons-passing.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011|publisher=CBC News|date=August 22, 2011[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Euplectes, Birds of Cameroon

The Black-winged Red Bishop (Euplectes hordeaceus), formerly known in southern Africa as the Fire-crowned Bishop, is a resident breeding bird species in tropical Africa from Senegal to Sudan and south to Angola, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
This common weaver occurs in a range of open country, especially tall grassland and often near water. It builds a spherical woven nest in tall grass. 2-4 eggs are laid.
The Black-winged Red Bishop is a stocky 13–15 cm bird. The breeding male is scarlet apart from his black face, belly and wings and brown tail.  The conical bill is thick and black. He displays prominently, singing high-pitched twitters from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or performing a slow hovering display flight.
The non-breeding male is yellow-brown, streaked above and shading to whitish below. It has a whitish supercilium. It resembles non-breeding male Northern Red Bishop, but is darker and has black wings. Females are similar, but paler. Young birds have wider pale fringes on their flight feathers.
The Black-winged Red Bishop is a gregarious species which feeds on seed, grain and some insects.

[[Numerical tower]]

CATEGORIES: Data types

In Scheme and some other Lisp dialects, a numerical tower is the set of data types that represent numbers in a given programming language.
Each type in the tower conceptually "sits on" a more fundamental type, so an integer is a rational number and a number, but the inverse is not necessarily true, i.e. not every number is an integer; this asymmetry implies that a language can allow implicit coercions of numerical types—without creating semantic problems—in only one direction: coercing an integer to a rational loses no information and does not affect the results of a function, but to coerce most reals to an integer could well result in a problem (for example, the real 1/3 does not equal any integer).
Scheme programming language, and also other Lisp dialects, defines all its arithmetic within this model.http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-9.html#%_sec_6.2.1 Some given implementations may extend or adapt the tower. Kawa, for example, extends it with a Quantity type that is even more generic than Number. Smalltalk is another programming language that follows this model, but it has a Magnitude as superclass of Number. Another popular variant is having both exact and inexact versions of the tower or parts of it. Most languages and language implementations do not support a Scheme-like numerical tower. Some languages support it only in a limited way.

[[Beach Boys Concert]]

CATEGORIES: The Beach Boys live albums, 1964 live albums, Capitol Records live albums, English-language live albums, Albums produced by Brian Wilson

Beach Boys Concert is a live album by the Beach Boys, released in 1964. It is their seventh album in all, and their third alone in the same year. What is perhaps most notable about the album is that it provided the Beach Boys with their first number one album in the US, remaining at the top for four weeks during a sixty-two week chart stay and becoming another gold seller.
Beach Boys Concert proves to be a timely release because leader and producer Brian Wilson was about to vacate his position in the live group, and would only perform sporadically with them over the course of the next three decades. It is also the only live document of the second line up of the Beach Boys in officially released LP form. It was recorded live at the Memorial Auditorium in Sacramento, CA.
The album includes several songs that The Beach Boys regularly performed live but had not previously included on an album, such as "Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow", "The Wanderer" and "Monster Mash". "The Little Old Lady from Pasadena" was actually a Jan & Dean hit.  Alongside those were a sampling of their favorites, such as "Hawaii", "In My Room", "Fun, Fun, Fun", and "I Get Around".
Studio doctoring on Beach Boys Concert is very evident, from the overdubbed vocals, and the fact that the concert also featured recordings from December 1963 (also where announcer Fred Vail's introduction comes from). Most obviously, Brian Wilson used the original music tracks for both "Fun, Fun, Fun" (which was sped up) and "I Get Around", both of which had elements removed to make them appear as though they were new performances.
Despite the shady circumstances surrounding its post-production, Beach Boys Concert is still an edgy live document and a missing link in their early discography, which captured The Beach Boys in a context that was about to change forever.
A truncated version was released on Pickwick Records as Wow! Great Concert! Beach Boys Concert (Capitol (S)TAO 2198) was paired on CD with Live in London, with bonus tracks from both periods. Bonus Tracks include "Don't Worry Baby (Live 1964)" (2:56) and "Heroes And Villains (Live 1968)" (3:47).

[[Arm ball]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

An arm ball is a type of delivery in cricket. It is a variation delivery bowled by an off spin bowler or slow left-arm orthodox bowler.  It is the finger spin equivalent of a wrist spinner's  slider or zooter.
In contrast to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers down the side of the ball on release. This means the ball has backspin on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on in the direction of the arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.
The arm ball is often used as a surprise variation by an off spinner who is turning the ball considerably. A complacent or poorly skilled batsman playing for the expected spin can be taken by surprise and get out bowled or lbw, or edge the ball with the outside edge of the bat to offer a catch to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Offspinners Graeme Swann and Tim May both had excellent arm balls. 
The arm ball has also been employed with a great deal of success over the years by left arm orthodox bowlers. In this case, the stock ball will turn away from the right handed batsman and the arm-ball would swing in, allowing the bowler to beat the inside edge of the bat and attack the stumps. Hedley Verity in particular was well known for his fast inswinging arm-ball, often bowled at yorker length. http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/22185.html 
Daniel Vettori and Derek Underwood are other examples of left arm orthodox bowlers renowned for use of an inswinging arm ball to good effect. Vettori famously bowled Darren Maddy with a perfect arm ball at the Oval Test Match of 1999. Having set up Maddy with two balls breaking away from him, Vettori then bowled a perfectly disguised arm ball. Thinking the ball was another stock delivery, Maddy left the ball, only to see it swing in and crash into his off-stump http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket-englands-new-solution-is-suicide-1114141.html

[[Off break]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

Off break is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is the attacking delivery of an off spin bowler. Off breaks are known as off spinners.
An off break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the fingers roll down the right side of the ball (for a right-handed bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler's perspective, this is to the left from the batsman's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the off side.
An off spin bowler will bowl mostly off breaks, varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries. Off breaks are considered to be one of the easier spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play. This is because the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from an off break, but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket, assuming the ball has not turned enough to miss the leg stump. 
A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling, because the ball moves away from his body. This means that any miscalculation can more easily result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A ball bowled by a left-arm orthodox spin bowler with an off break action spins in the opposite direction. Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a left-arm orthodox spinner.

[[Leg break]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

A leg break is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. A delivery of a right-handed leg spin bowler. Leg breaks are also colloquially known as leggies or wrist spinners, as the wrist is the body part which is primarily used to impart spin on the ball, as opposed to the fingers in the case of off spinners.
A leg break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball allowed to roll out of the hand over the ring  finger, giving the ball an anti-clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.
A leg spin bowler will bowl mostly leg breaks, varying them by adjusting the line and length of the deliveries.
Leg breaks are considered to be one of the more difficult spin deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play because the ball moves away from their body. This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. 
Alternatively, for a ball aimed outside the leg stump, the breaking may be so sharp that the ball goes behind a right-handed batsman and hits the stumps – the batsman is then said (informally) to be "bowled around his legs". The animation on this page illustrates such a delivery.
A left-handed batsman has less difficulty facing leg spin bowling, because the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to get the batsman out bowled or caught from a leg break. 
A ball bowled by a left-arm unorthodox spin bowler with a leg break action spins in the opposite direction, i.e. from left to right as the bowler sees it. Such a ball is not normally called a leg break but a left-arm unorthodox spinner or "Chinaman". Notable leg-spin bowlers include Shane Warne, Richie Benaud, Shahid Afridi and Anil Kumble.

Piece of Time is the debut album by the technical death metal band Atheist, released in 1989 in Europe. However, it was not released in the United States until 1990. This was because the label that Atheist had initially signed with, Mean Machine Records, was going bankrupt, and the band had to search for another label. They eventually signed with UK label Active Records, who released their album in Europe soon after. The album was not released in the US for another six months, until Metal Blade Records finally arranged a licensing deal with Active Records and released it to the American market in November 1990. Piece of Time is the only Atheist album to feature bassist Roger Patterson, although he wrote much of the bass on Unquestionable Presence.

In North America, the main reservoir for R. prowazekii is the flying squirrel. R. prowazekii is often surrounded by a protein microcapsular layer and slime layer; the natural life cycle of the bacterium generally involves a vertebrate and an invertebrate host, usually an arthropod, typically the human body louse. A form of R.. prowazekii that exists in the feces of arthropods remains stably infective for months. R. prowazekii also appears to be the closest free-living relative of mitochondria, based on genome sequencing.

CATEGORIES: Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in California, Buildings and structures in Yosemite National Park, Campgrounds in California

Camp 4 is a campground in Yosemite National Park. It became notable after World War II as the hangout for rock climbers with many spending months there—not necessarily legally. It is located near Yosemite Falls, on the north side of the valley. There is a single parking lot at the campground, and no driveways connecting to individual campsites, so visitors must carry their gear in. Nearby boulders have long been used for bouldering. Among the  boulders located here, the Columbia Boulder is probably the most famous. On it is the world-renowned boulder problem called the Midnight Lightning first done by Ron Kauk in 1978. It is easily recognizable by a painting of a white thunderbolt next to it.

[[Elements (Atheist album)]]

CATEGORIES: Atheist (band) albums, 1993 albums, Metal Blade Records albums, Relapse Records albums

Elements is the third album released by the progressive / technical death metal band Atheist. It was released on August 30, 1993 by Music for Nations in Europe and by Metal Blade Records in the US. Elements was reissued by Relapse Records in 2005 and was digitally remastered with the addition of six bonus tracks.
The album has more of a jazz influenced style than their two previous albums[tpl]Fact|date=March 2008[/tpl], but it remains highly technically complex.  Eduardo Rivadavia described it for Allmusic as remaining "admirably true to the band's famously complicated arrangements, syncopated rhythms, and ultra-precise attack, but also boasting a cleaner musicality never before attempted by the group". Elements was written, recorded and mixed in forty days in Pro Media Studios.Elements at Encyclopaedia Metallum The band wanted to dissolve but they were required to finish their third album in order to fulfill a contract to their record label. Elements features the addition of a third guitarist, Frank Emmi. Initially, Rand Burkey was not going to appear on the album, and as Kelly Shaefer had developed carpal tunnel syndrome, (preventing him from playing anything but rhythm guitar) a new lead guitar player was needed. Before recording, Burkey rejoined the band, and thus the band ended up with three guitarists. Shaefer plays rhythm guitar, while Emmi and Burkey share responsibilities for leads and solos.
Elements was Atheist's last studio album for 17 years, until the 2010 release of Jupiter.

Enalapril (marketed as Vasotec in the USA, Enaladex in some other countries, and Enacard for veterinary useEnacard listed at http://www.drugs.com.) is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and some types of chronic heart failure. ACE converts the peptide hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II. One of the actions of angiotensin II is the vasoconstriction of blood vessels resulting in an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors such as enalapril prevent this effect. Enalapril has been shown to lower the death rate in systolic heart failure.McMurray JJV, Systolic heart failure, N Engl J Med, 362:228, Jan. 21, 2010). Enalapril was the first member of the group known as the dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitors.

[[List of cities in Virginia]]

CATEGORIES: Cities in Virginia, Lists of cities in the United States by state, Virginia geography-related lists

This is a complete list of cities in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States.
Since 1871, all cities in Virginia have been independent cities, which are administratively independent of any county.  [tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], there are 38 independent cities, which are considered county-equivalents for census purposes.  Many towns are as large as cities, but are not incorporated as cities and are situated within a parent county or counties.  Eight independent cities had 2010 populations of less than 10,000 with the smallest, Norton, having a population of only 3958.  In 2010, the largest towns were Blacksburg (with 42,620 people) and Leesburg (42,616).  Four other towns also had populations of over 10,000 people.  For a complete list of these towns, see List of towns in Virginia.  For major unincorporated population centers, see List of unincorporated towns in Virginia.
Virginia's independent cities were classified by the Virginia General Assembly in 1871 as cities of the first class and cities of the second class.  The Virginia Constitution of 1902 included defined first class cities as those having a population of 10,000 or more based upon the last census enumeration while second class cities were those that had a population of less than 10,000.  Cities which previously been granted a city charter, but did not have the requisite population, had their status grandfathered in.  Second class did not have a court of record and were required to share the cost of that court with their adjacent county and also shared the cost for three constitutional officers of that court—generally, the clerk, commonwealth attorney and sheriff—and those shared officers stood for election in both the city and the county.  At least two constitutional officers—treasurer and commissioner of the revenue—were required to be elected solely by the residents of the city.  The distinction between first and second class cities was ended with the Virginia Constitution of 1971.  However, cities that were classified as second class cities at the time of the adoption of the 1971 Virginia Constitution were authorized to continue sharing their court system and three constitutional officers with the adjacent county.  [tpl]As of|2003[/tpl], 14 of Virginia's independent cities retain these features.

[[Pleural empyema]]
CATEGORIES: Diseases of pleura

Pleural empyema, also known as pyothorax or purulent pleuritis, is empyema (an accumulation of pus) in the pleural cavity that can develop when bacteria invade the pleural space, usually in the context of a pneumonia. It is one of various kinds of pleural effusion. There are three stages: exudative, when there is an increase in pleural fluid with or without the presence of pus; fibrinopurulent, when fibrous septa form localized pus pockets; and the final organizing stage, when there is scarring of the pleura membranes with possible inability of the lung to expand. Simple pleural effusions occur in up to 40% of bacterial pneumonias. They are usually small and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy. If however an empyema develops additional intervention is required.

[[Full toss]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

A full toss is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It describes any delivery that reaches the batsman without bouncing on the pitch first.
Full tosses are rarely bowled deliberately, as they defeat the purpose of most types of delivery, which is to deceive the batsman by bouncing unpredictably on the pitch. They are commonly greeted with delight by a batsman, as they tend to be very easy to hit. A full toss is frequently the result of an error made while attempting to bowl a yorker. A yorker usually  bounces at the batsmen's feet.
Occasionally a full toss can surprise a batsman so effectively that he is unable to play it properly, and this can lead to a wicket, but few bowlers rely on this. There have been occasions in which a bowler intentionally bowls a full toss to achieve maximum swing into the base of the stumps. This was commonly seen with Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan, though recently Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka has been bowling low full tosses with his unorthodox round arm action.
Full tosses below the waist are also commonly accidental. They can be caused by mistiming in the bowler's action as he attempts a yorker or changes his hand grip to produce a deceptive slower ball.
A full toss can also be used by a bowler to deliberately intimidate weaker, lower order batsmen.

[[Dwayne Andreas]]

CATEGORIES: 1918 births, Living people, American chief executives, Archer Daniels Midland

Dwayne Orville Andreas (born 4 March 1918) is one of the most prominent political campaign donorshttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/president/players/andreas.html in the United States, having contributed millions of dollars to Democratic and Republican candidates alike. For twenty-five years, he was in the leadership of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), the largest processor of farm commodities in the United States, where he made his fortune.
Andreas was born in Worthington, Minnesota. He grew up mostly in Iowa (with siblings Albert, Lenore, Glen, Osborne and Lowell) and attended Wheaton College in Illinois, but dropped out in his sophomore year after getting married, and went to work for a modest, family-owned food-processing firm in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When Cargill bought the Cedar Rapids facility in 1945, Andreas joined the commodity firm, eventually becoming a vice president. Andreas resigned from Cargill in 1952, and continued in the vegetable oil business, eventually as an executive of the Grain Terminal Association.
In 1971 Andreas became Chief Executive Officer of ADM, and is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse — so powerful that by 1996, ADM had been investigated for price-fixing and was assessed the largest antitrust fine in United States history: 100 million dollars.  Andreas remained CEO until 1997.
While not well known to the public, Andreas commands much respect among Washington politicians for his largesse.  As part of the investigations surrounding illegal campaign fundraising linked to the Watergate scandal, Andreas was charged with (but acquitted of) illegally contributing $100,000 to Hubert Humphrey's 1968 presidential campaign.  In 1972 Andreas unlawfully contributed $25,000 to President Nixon's re-election campaign via Watergate burglar Bernard Barker.  Other recipients of Andreas's "tithing" — as he puts it — have included George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, and Jack Kemp.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]
According to Mother Jones magazine:
 During the 1992 election, Andreas gave more than $1.4 million in soft money and $345,000 to individual candidates, using multiple donors in his company and family members (including wife Inez) to circumvent contribution limits. 
Not all of Andreas's charity goes directly to politicians: in the 1990s he contributed $2.5 million to Florida public broadcasting network WXEL. He also aided the Community Partnership for the Homeless.
Andreas was one of several signatories to a May 20, 2004 open letter exhorting President George W. Bush to lift travel and humanitarian aid restrictions on Cuba. He is on the Board of Trustees of The Forum for International Policy and is the namesake of Barry University's Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law.
Andreas was implicated in the financial scandal of the Orthodox Church in America for his donations to Russia in 1991.Orthodox Church in America#Financial scandalhttp://www.oca.org/PDF/SIC/2008-0903-1-sicreport.pdf
One of his closest friends was former New York governor and two-time Republican presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey.  It was Andreas who discovered his friend following Dewey's fatal heart attack in his room at Seaview, a Florida golf club in which Andreas held partial ownership.
Andreas was portrayed by Tom Smothers in the 2009 film The Informant! about the Lysine price-fixing conspiracy.

CATEGORIES: Computing-related lists, Early microcomputers, Home computers

This is a list of early microcomputers sold to hobbyists and developers. These microcomputers were often sold as "DIY" kits or pre-built machines in relatively small numbers in the mid-1970s.  These systems were primarily used for teaching the use of microprocessors and supporting peripheral devices, and unlike home computers were rarely used with pre-written application software. Most early micros came without alphanumeric keyboards or displays, which had to be provided by the user. RAM was quite small in the unexpanded systems (a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes). By 1976 the number of pre-assembled machines was growing, and the 1977 introduction of the "Trinity" of Commodore PET, TRS-80 and Apple II generally marks the end of the "early" microcomputer era, and the advent of the consumer home computer era that followed.

Shaikh Mohammad Khiābāni (sometimes spelled Khiyabani), also known as Shaikh Mohammad Khiābāni Tabrizi (1880–1920), was an Iranian cleric, political leader, and representative to the parliament.
He was born in Khameneh, near Tabriz to Haji Abdolhamid from Khameneh, a merchant. He became active during the Persian Constitutional Revolution and was a prominent dissident against foreign colonialism, which subsequently led to his sending into exile by the Ottomans in 1918.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Khiabani re-established the Democrat Party of Tabriz after being banned for five years, and published the Tajaddod newspaper, the official organ of the party, edited by his supporter Taqi Rafat. Later, in a protest to the 1919 Treaty between Persia and the United Kingdom, which exclusively transferred the rights of deciding about all military, financial, and customs affairs of Persia to the British, he revolted and took Tabriz and surrounding areas, calling it Azadistan ("land of liberty"); he was not, however, a separatist.Cosroe Chaqueri, The Soviet Socialist Republic of Iran, 1920-1921: Birth of the Trauma (Pittsburgh and London: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995), p. 465. After the fall of Vosough od-Dowleh, the then prime minister, the new prime minister sent Mehdi Qoli Hedayat to Tabriz, giving him full authority, and he crushed and killed Khiabani in the late summer of 1920 (Hedayat claimed that Khiabani had committed suicide).

[[Discrepancy function]]

CATEGORIES: Structural equation models

A discrepancy function is a mathematical function which describes how closely a structural model conforms to observed data. Larger values of the discrepancy function indicate a poor fit of the model to data. In general, the parameter estimates for a given model are chosen so as to make the discrepancy function for that model as small as possible. 
There are several basic types of discrepancy functions, including maximum likelihood (ML), generalized least squares (GLS), and ordinary least squares (OLS), which are considered the "classical" discrepancy functions.[tpl]cite web | title = Discrepancy Functions Used in SEM | url = http://www2.gsu.edu/~mkteer/discrep.html | accessdate=2008-08-18 [/tpl]  Discrepancy functions all meet the following basic criteria:

[[Back of the Y Masterpiece Television]]
CATEGORIES: New Zealand comedy television series, TV2 (New Zealand) programmes, C4 (TV channel) programmes

Back Of The Y previously known as Back Of The Y Masterpiece Television is a cult  New Zealand TV series, created by Chris Stapp and Matt Heath. Featuring such memorable characters as Randy Campbell, Danny Parker, Dick Johansonson, Cindy Cockburn and Spanners Watson, the show glorified stunts and the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol. The Hollywood special episode featured Randy Campbell jumping off the back of the Y in the famous Hollywood sign.
Back of the Y is  centred on a mock live TV show, featuring segments such as Randy Campbell's Extreme Stunts and "Cunstables". The show was low budget and apparently filmed with amateur equipment and edited on home computers. The show description at the start of the first episode references one of the cast members and sets the agenda for the rest of the show "Phil Bruff had a dream. To make a New Zealand TV show that wasn't complete shit. He failed... Miserably!!!"
The show consisted of 7 episodes of Back Of The Y Masterpiece Television and The Back Of The Y Goes To Hollywood Special.
In addition to being screened upon New Zealand television, the show has been given airtime on MTV2 in the UK and on Channel V in Australia. They are also responsible for 'That Cunt Rabbit' (an animated TV show for MTV UK), Heck (animated show also for MTV UK) and Balls Of Steel (for Channel 4 UK).
Back Of The Y features the New Zealand band "Deja Voodoo", originally a fictional house band. After Back Of The Y Stapp and Heath developed Deja Voodoo into a "proper" band.
In 2005 Back Of The Y released a TV special,  "Bogan's Heroes" a comedy based on life in prison.
In 2007, Stapp and Heath released The Devil Dared Me To (The Randy Campbell Story). The film is backed by Headstrong Productions, in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. The film tells the story of Randy Campbell, Back of the Y's Stuntman character, and how he rose to become "the worlds greatest stuntman". The film stars Chris Stapp as the titular Randy Campbell, and Matt Heath as Dick Johansonson as well as an all-star New Zealand cast.
Back of the Y begun shooting a second series from Monday 24th Sept 2007 - Friday 28th Sept 2007 at Henderson Valley Studios in Auckland.
The second series of Back of the Y was aired on C4 in New Zealand from 26 May 2008. Series 3 is made up of 6 episodes and a making of special.
They've also had a series in 2010 called "Bogan Family Films" which has already screened earlier in the year.

[[Outswinger]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

An outswinger is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by swing bowlers.
An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam at an angle and the first two fingers running along either side of the seam. Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the left (as seen from the bowler's viewpoint). When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it points slightly to the left as well, and releases the ball rotating about a vertical axis with the seam along the rotational axis. The angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the left. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left.
From a right-handed batsman's point of view, the swing is away from his body towards his right, i.e. towards the off side. This swing away from the body is the source of the name outswinger. To a left-handed batsman, the swing is in towards the body and towards the leg side which from a technical point of view makes the outswinger, now an inswinger.
Outswingers may be considered to be one of the more difficult fast deliveries for a right-handed batsman to play. This is because the ball moves away from his body. This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders.
To a right-handed batsman, a fast bowler will generally concentrate on bowling repeated outswingers, aiming to tempt the batsman to play away from his body and get him out in one of the ways described above. However, sometimes a fast bowler may attempt to deceive the batsman by bowling an off cutter instead of a standard outswinger, and look to get a batsmen out either bowled or lbw. More commonly, variation is in the length of the ball, with yorkers and bouncers.

[[Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture]]

CATEGORIES: Video cards

Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (TIGA) was a graphics interface standard created by Texas Instruments that defined the software interface to graphics processors. Using this standard, any software written for TIGA should work correctly on a TIGA-compliant graphics interface card.
The TIGA standard is independent of resolution and color depth which provides a certain degree of future proofing. This standard was designed for high-end graphics.
However, TIGA was not widely adopted. Instead, VESA and Super VGA became the de facto standard for PC graphics devices after the VGA.
Texas Instrument's TMS34010 and TMS34020 Graphics System Processors (GSP) were the only TIGA-compliant graphics processors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]
The primary manufacturers of mainstream TIGA cards for the PC clone market included Number Nine Visual Technology and Hercules. Number Nine's PPC_060 was a well-known card which found acceptance in the CAD market. Hercules manufactured cards such as the Graphics Station and Chrome lines which were marketed primarily toward users of Microsoft Windows. In the early 1990s, Texas Instruments France (which had marketing control for the TIGA architecture and GSP chipsets in Europe) experimented with manufacturing and selling its own range of consumer oriented video cards based on TIGA and aimed at speeding up the user experience of Windows. These products were named TIGA Diamond (34020 based) and TIGA Star (34010 based), and provided a platform for selling TI DRAM and video palette chips as well as the GSP chips themselves.
Despite the superiority of the technology in comparison to typical SuperVGA cards of the era, the relatively high cost and emerging local bus graphics standards meant that IT distributors and PC manufacturers could not see a niche for these products at consumer level.

CATEGORIES: Fishing vessels

A fishing fleet is an aggregate of commercial fishing vessels. The term may be used of all vessels operating out of a particular port, all vessels engaged in a particular type of fishing (as in the "tuna fishing fleet"), or all fishing vessels of a country or region.
Although fishing vessels are not formally organized as if they were a naval fleet, very often the constraints of time and weather are such that they must all leave or return together, thus creating at least the appearance of an organized body (some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, did however organise their fishing fleets partially along naval lines and used the ships to also gather naval intelligence).Moscow's South Pacific Fishing Fleet Is Much More Than It Seems - Kim, Byung Ki; The Heritage Foundation, Asian Studies Backgrounder No. 80 September 6, 1988.
Fishermen operating a particular type of vessel or in a particular port often belong to a local association which disseminates information and may be used to coordinate activities, such as how best to prevent overfishing in particular areas.

CATEGORIES: 1951 births, Living people, American male singers, Songwriters from Alabama, Musicians from Birmingham, Alabama

Willis Alan Ramsey (born March 5, 1951) is an American singer/songwriter, a cult legend among fans of Americana and Texas country. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama and raised in Dallas, Texas. Ramsey graduated from Highland Park High School in 1969, and was a prominent baritone in the High School's Lads and Lassies Choir. In his senior year, he played a leading role in the musical Carousel. He released the critically acclaimed album, Willis Alan Ramsey, in 1972 on the Shelter label. The album included "Muskrat Candlelight" which was covered twice as "Muskrat Love," first by America in 1973, then by Captain & Tennille, who scored a #4 hit with the tune.
Windham Hill artist Michael Hedges cited Ramsey as a strong influence on his left-handed tapping techniques.  In a radio interview, Hedges claimed he developed the technique listening to Ramsey's album, saying Ramsey had no idea "how I got it from him, so I guess I'm safe."
Owing to conflict with his label, Ramsey left Shelter at the end of his contract. As a result, Ramsey's fans have been waiting more than 40 years for the release of his "mythical second album". When asked where the new album is, he often responds, "What's wrong with the first one?"
In the 1980s, he moved to Great BritainBiography to reconnect with his ancestry and study traditional and modern music narrative. At the same time, he enjoyed a revival in the United States, due in part to numerous artists who cut versions of Ramsey's songs, including Widespread Panic ("Geraldine & The Honey Bee"), Jerry Jeff Walker ("Northeast Texas Women"), Waylon Jennings, Shawn Colvin ("Satin Sheets"), Jimmy Buffett ("The Ballad of Spider John," "Northeast Texas Women"), and Jimmie Dale Gilmore ("Goodbye to Old Missoula").[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-ramsey_0916gd.State.Edition1.1f6cc5f.html|title=Seminal songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey prepares his second album - 37 years later |last=Peppard|first=Alan|date=16 September 2009|work=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=18 February 2010[/tpl] In 1989, he returned to the United States and began performing again. Backed by Champ Hood, multi-instrumentalist (of Uncle Walt's Band fame), Ramsey could often be found on the same bill with another Dallas singer-songwriter, Alison Rogers. The two married in 1991 and continue to perform together. In 1996, Ramsey and Rogers co-wrote Lyle Lovett's hit, "That's Right, You're Not From Texas".
In 2000, Ramsey appeared on Austin City Limits, showcasing his new material and performing his classics. He is currently mixing his new album, "Gentilly", an independent release, financed by old friends and fans mostly from the Dallas and Austin area. Co-produced by Willis, Alison Rogers and Jamie Oldaker, guest musicians include Oldaker (drums, percussion); Sam Bush & Tim O'Brien (mandolin, vocals); Viktor Krauss, Roscoe Beck & Freebo (bass); Bruce Bouton (steel guitar); Mickey Raphael (harmonica); Walt Richmond (piano, organ); Joel Guzman (accordion); Marcia Ball,  Tommy Malone, Abra Moore & Alison Rogers (vocals).

[[Evolutionary taxonomy]]

CATEGORIES: Phylogenetics, Biological classification

Evolutionary taxonomy, evolutionary systematics or Darwinian classification is a branch of biological classification that seeks to classify organisms using a combination of phylogenetic relationship and degree of evolutionary changes. This type of taxonomy considers taxa rather than single species, so that groups of species give rise to new groups.[tpl]Citation |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |author-link=Ernst W. Mayr |last2=Bock |first2=W.J. |year=2002 |title=Classifications and other ordering systems |journal=J. Zool. Syst. Evol. Research |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=169–94 |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0469.2002.00211.x |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.mobot.org/plantscience/resbot/EvSy/PDF/Bock-2002-class-Mayr.pdf[/tpl] The concept found its current form in the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s.
Evolutionary taxonomy differs from strict pre-Darwinian Linnaean taxonomy (producing orderly lists only), in that it builds phylogenetic trees. While in phylogenetic nomenclature each taxon must consist of a single ancestral node and all its descendants, evolutionary taxonomy allows for groups to be excluded from their parent taxa (e.g. dinosaurs are not considered to include birds, but to have given rise to them), thus permitting paraphyletic taxa.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/90/9/1263 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.90.9.1263 | title = Incongruence between cladistic and taxonomic systems | year = 2003 | author = Grant, V. | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | page = 1263 [/tpl]

The Second Sophistic is a literary-historical term referring to the Greek writers who flourished from the reign of Nero until c. 230 AD and who were catalogued and celebrated by Philostratus in his Lives of the Sophists (481). However, some recent research has indicated that this Second Sophistic, which was previously thought to have very suddenly and abruptly appeared in the late 1st century, actually had its roots in the early 1st century.Bruce W. Winter, Philo and Paul Among the Sophists. 2nd ed. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2002. It was followed in the 5th century by the philosophy of Byzantine rhetoric, sometimes referred to as the "Third Sophistic."[tpl]cite book |title= Greek Literature |first=Gregory |last=Nagy |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93771-X |pages=179[/tpl]
Writers known as members of the Second Sophistic include Nicetas of Smyrna, Aelius Aristides, Dio Chrysostom, Herodes Atticus, Philostratus, Lucian, and Polemon of Laodicea. Plutarch is also often associated with the Second Sophistic movement as well, although many historians[tpl]Who|date=February 2011[/tpl] consider him to have been somewhat aloof from its emphasis on rhetoric, especially in his later work.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

[[Isogloss]]

CATEGORIES: Historical linguistics, Dialectology, Isoglosses, Language comparison, Linguistics terminology

An isogloss—also called a heterogloss (see Etymology below)—is the locative boundary of a certain linguistic feature, such as the pronunciation of a vowel, the meaning of a word, or use of some syntactic feature. Major dialects are typically demarcated by groups of isoglosses; for example the Benrath line distinguishes High German from the other West Germanic languages; and the La Spezia–Rimini Line divides the Northern Italian dialects from Central Italian dialects. However, an individual isogloss may or may not have any coincidence with a language border. For example, the front-rounding of /y/ cuts across France and Germany, while the /y/ is absent from Italian and Spanish words that are cognate with the /y/-containing French words.
One of the most well-known isoglosses is the centum-satem isogloss.
Similar to an isogloss, an isograph is a distinguishing feature of a writing system. Both concepts are also used in historical linguistics.

[[Benrath line]]
CATEGORIES: German language, Geography of Germany, Isoglosses

In German linguistics, the Benrath line (German: Benrather Linie) is the maken-machen isogloss: dialects north of the line have the original [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] in maken (to make), while those to the south have [tpl]IPA|/x/[/tpl] (machen). The Line runs from Benrath (part of Düsseldorf) and Aachen to eastern Germany near Frankfurt an der Oder in the area of Berlin and Dessau.
The High German consonant shift (3rd to 9th centuries AD), in which the (northern) Low German dialects for the most part did not participate, affected the southern varieties of the West Germanic dialect continuum. This shift is traditionally seen to distinguish the High German varieties from the other West Germanic languages. 
The impact of the High German consonant shift increases gradually to the South. The Benrath line does not mark the northernmost effect of the High German consonant shift, since the Uerdingen line, the ik-ich isogloss, lies slightly further north; and some of the peripheral changes associated with the shift did affect Low German.

The rlogin homepage is at http://rlogin.sourceforge.net.
rlogin is also the name of the application layer protocol used by the software, part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Authenticated users can act as if they were physically present at the computer. RFC 1282, in which it was defined, states that: "The rlogin facility provides a remote-echoed, locally flow-controlled virtual terminal with proper flushing of output." rlogin communicates with a daemon, rlogind, on the remote host. rlogin is similar to the Telnet command, but has the disadvantage of not being as customizable and being able to connect only to Unix hosts.

Except for size, it closely resembles common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), Heracleum sosnowskyi or garden angelica (Angelica archangelica). It is phototoxic and considered to be a noxious weed in many jurisdictions.  Giant hogweed is native to the Caucasus Region and Central Asia. It was introduced to Britain as an ornamental in the 19th century, and it has also spread to Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Latvia, the United States and Canada.
The sap of giant hogweed causes phytophotodermatitis in humans, resulting in blisters, long-lasting scars, and—if it comes in contact with eyes—blindness.  These serious reactions are due to the furocoumarin derivatives in the leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and seeds of the plant.

CATEGORIES: Australian independent record labels, Au Go Go Records albums, Record labels established in 1979, Indie rock record labels, Alternative rock record labels

Au Go Go Records is the name of a Melbourne, Australia based independent record label.
It was founded by Bruce Milne and Philip Morland  from a house in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy in 1979 and is now operated by Greta Moon.
The label started releasing bands on the Melbourne punk and New Wave scene. Its first release was in 1979 with the EP Overnight by Two Way Garden.  The labels first 25 releases were the bands' debut recordings, and included some seminal Australian acts such as The Young Charlatans, Mungabeans, Marching Girls, Clint Small, Scapa Flow, Little Murders, the Zorros and Dorian Gray. Philip Morland left and Greta Moon joined in 1982. 
In April 1989, the label released the debut single by the Candy Harlots, entitled Red Hot Rocket, with the initial 500 copies pressed on red vinyl and wrapped in a pair of women's lace knickers.
By 1994 the label started to increase its profile due to the local and overseas success of bands like The Moodists (featuring Dave Graney and Mick Turner of Dirty Three).  Releases from this later period included the Scientists "Swampland" (which was actually the b-side of the single, with the a-side being "This Is My Happy Hour") and God's "My Pal", one of the label's most popular releases, as well as titles by Ollie Olsen's band NO, Harem Scarem, various compilations such as the Asleep At The Wheel collection of (mostly unsigned) Melbourne bands, and the well-received Hard To Beat, a double album tribute to the Stooges, featuring many Australian acts. 
The label also branched out into international releases, issuing albums (under license) by overseas bands such as Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, Dinosaur Junior and Big Black.  Au Go Go was also instrumental in helping these bands tour Australia.
In 1987, with the success of the mail-order service, the record shop was started. The shop shifted to a smaller space in central Melbourne in June 2000, but closed in late 2003 after losing its lease.
Bruce Milne started an offshoot label, Giant Claw Records, in 1989, to issue 7" singles. He is currently involved in running Melbourne pub/rock venue the Tote, in Collingwood, as well as a new label, In-Fidelity Records.
Au-Go-Go continued throughout the '90's, issuing early releases from such Australian acts as Spiderbait, The Meanies and Magic Dirt, the latter becoming one of the label's top attractions. Magic Dirt left Au-Go-Go in 1999, and the label never fully recovered. Due to a lack of funds, many of Au-Go-Go's releases are now out of print and are fast becoming collector's items.

CATEGORIES: Exact solutions in general relativity, Black holes, Metric tensors

In physics and astronomy, the Reissner–Nordström metric is a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M.
The metric was discovered by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström.
These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:
where Q represents the body's electric charge and J represents its spin angular momentum.

CATEGORIES: Football clubs in Norway, Association football clubs established in 1906, Sport in Halden, 1906 establishments in Norway

Kvik Halden FK is a Norwegian Football club, founded on 19 June 1906.
The club plays in the Norwegian Second Division from 2011. In 2010 it contested a playoff to win promotion, and succeeded by beating Eik-Tønsberg 5–1 on aggregate.
In 1997, a merger between the two Halden-based clubs FK Kvik and Halden FK resulted in the formation of Kvik Halden FK. Long before the merger, FK Kvik was informally known as Kvik Halden anyway, to avoid confusion with the other FK Kvik from Trondheim. FK Kvik was the older and better of the two, but Halden FK had a rather large base of young players. The merger was controversial, and has been criticized by some who claim that the result of the merger was that FK Kvik simply took over Halden FK.
Kvik Halden's only claim to fame came in 1918, when the club (then FK Kvik) won the Norwegian Cup, beating SK Brann in the final. FK Kvik played two other Cup Finals, in 1915 and 1922, but lost both, both times to Odd Grenland. 
After World War II the team has never played in the highest football division. Prior to World War II, Kvik had several players on the national team and was in the very top of Norwegian football.

[[Cauchy horizon]]
CATEGORIES: Theory of relativity

In physics, a Cauchy horizon is a light-like boundary of the domain of validity of a Cauchy problem (a particular boundary value problem of the theory of partial differential equations).  One side of the horizon contains closed space-like geodesics and the other side contains closed time-like geodesics.
Waves traveling in Misner space approaching a Cauchy horizon would receive a frequency boost proportional to
each time they pass through the identification world line.  As this happens infinitely many times while approaching the horizon, the stress–energy tensor diverges at the horizon.  Presumably, this prevents spacetime from developing closed time-like curves that would otherwise be feasible.
Under the averaged weak energy condition (AWEC), Cauchy horizons are inherently unstable. However, cases of AWEC violation, such as the Casimir effect, do exist.  If we can assume that the spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon violates AWEC, then the horizon becomes stable and frequency boosting effects would be canceled out by the tendency of the spacetime to act as a divergent lens. Were this conjecture to be shown empirically true, it would provide a counter-example to the strong cosmic censorship conjecture.
The simplest example is the internal horizon of a Reissner–Nordström black hole.

[[Proper length]]
CATEGORIES: Theory of relativity

In relativistic physics, proper distance is an invariant measure of the distance between two spacelike-separated events, or of the length of a spacelike path within a spacetime. In contrast, proper length[tpl]cite book |author=Moses Fayngold |title=Special Relativity and How it Works |location=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |isbn=3527406077[/tpl] or rest length[tpl]cite journal |author=Franklin, Jerrold |title=Lorentz contraction, Bell's spaceships, and rigid body motion in special relativity |journal=European Journal of Physics |volume=31 |year=2010 |pages=291–298 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/31/2/006 |bibcode = 2010EJPh...31..291F |issue=2 |arxiv = 0906.1919 [/tpl] refer to the length of an object in the object's rest frame, which is not necessarily the same as the proper distance between two events.
The measurement of lengths is more complicated in the theory of relativity than in classical mechanics.  In classical mechanics, lengths are measured based on the assumption that the locations of all points involved are measured simultaneously. But in the theory of relativity, the notion of simultaneity is dependent on the observer. Proper distance provide an invariant measure, whose value is the same for all observers.
Proper distance is analogous to proper time. The difference is that proper distance is the invariant interval of a spacelike path or pair of spacelike-separated events, while proper time is the invariant interval of a timelike path or pair of timelike-separated events.

Julie Marie Vinter Hansen (20 July 1890 – 27 July 1960) was a Danish astronomer.
Vinter Hansen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark.  While studying at the University of Copenhagen, she was appointed a computer at the University's observatory in 1915.  In the pre-electronic era, computers were humans that worked doing hand calculations at the direction of astronomers.  She was the first woman to hold an appointment at the University.  She was later appointed observatory assistant and, in 1922, observer.  She was a very energetic worker, who, along with her normal work of observing and performing mathematical reductions of observations took on the task of editing the Nordisk Astronomisk Tidsskrift (Nordic Astronomy Review).  She later became Director of the International Astronomical Union's telegram bureau and Editor of its Circulars.
By 1939, Vinter Hansen was the First Astronomer at the Observatory of the University of Copenhagen, widely known for her accurate computation of orbits of minor planets and comets.  In that year, she received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (travel award), and with the award money undertook a tour through the United States to Japan and back.  On her return trip in 1940, the outbreak of World War II restricted her homeward journey.  She was awarded a Martin Kellogg Fellowship at the University of California which allowed her to work for a time in the United States.  Also in 1940 she was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy.  
Vinter Hansen was appointed to a knight in the Order of the Dannebrog in 1956 and continued her career at the University of Copenhagen until her death in Mürren, Switzerland in 1960, and was buried in Copenhagen.

Easy is an album recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and released by Motown Records on September 16, 1969 under the Tamla Records label. One song on the album, "Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By", was a hit single and remains popular to this day. Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967. Marvin Gaye later claimed that as a result, most of the female vocals on this album were performed by Valerie Simpson, who served as co-songwriter and co-producer for the LP with her boyfriend and future husband Nickolas Ashford.  
Simpson is quoted in Ludie Montgomery's biography of Terrell, My Sister Tommie, as not having subbed Terrell for vocals.  Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to The Complete Motown Singles series.The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 9: 1969 (Motown/Hip-O Select, 2008 On a recent documentary on Terrell, Simpson admitted she sang with Gaye during sessions saying, "I sang things with Marvin because Tammi was not available.  And, then we would bring Tammi in to go over her parts.  Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed."  
Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell's health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell's family for insurance of her health. At the time the album was released, Terrell was on her seventh operation to cure the brain tumor that would eventually kill her after the eighth operation. The album was released on compact disc in 1992, and again in 2001 as part of The Complete Duets.

Chislehurst Caves is a [tpl]convert|22|mi|km|0[/tpl] long series of tunnels in Chislehurst, in the south eastern suburbs of London. Today they are a tourist attraction and although they are called caves, they are entirely man-made and were dug and used as chalk and flint mines. The earliest mention of the mines is circa 1250 and they are last believed to have been worked in the 1830s. During the early 1900s they became a popular tourist attraction, but in the First World War, they were used as an ammunition depot associated with the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich then they were used for mushroom cultivation in the 1930s.
During the Second World War, when the aerial bombardment of London began in September 1940, the caves were used as an air raid shelter. Within a short time, it became an underground city of some 15,000 inhabitants with electric lighting, a chapel and a hospital. Shortly after VE Day the shelter was officially closed. One baby, christened Rose Cavena Wakeman, was born in the caves.

Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an endocrine disorder that is an uncommon and potentially lethal form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It arises from defects in the earliest stages of adrenal cortisol synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria of the cells of the adrenal cortex and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone—the first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. Consequently, they are usually raised as girls. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol.

Salome, Op. 54, is an opera in one act by Richard Strauss to a German libretto by the composer, based on Hedwig Lachmann's German translation of the French play Salomé by Oscar Wilde. Strauss dedicated the opera to his friend Sir Edgar Speyer.
The opera is famous (at the time of its premiere, infamous) for its "Dance of the Seven Veils". It is now better known for the more shocking final scene (often a concert-piece for dramatic sopranos), where Salome declares her love to – and kisses – the severed head of John the Baptist.

[[Lei Áurea]]

CATEGORIES: Legal history of Brazil, Slavery in Brazil, 1888 in law, 1888 in Brazil

The Lei Áurea ([tpl]IPA-pt|ˈlej ˈawɾjɐ[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-en|Golden Law[/tpl]), adopted on May 13, 1888, was the law that abolished slavery in Brazil.
It was preceded by the Rio Branco Law of September 28, 1871 ("the Law of Free Birth"), which freed all children born to slave parents, and by the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law (also known as "the Law of Sexagenarians"), of September 28, 1885, that freed slaves when they reached the age of 60.
The Lei Áurea had only two articles:
The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. However, it did not provide any support to either freed slaves or their former owners to adjust their lives to their new status: slave owners did not receive any state indemnification, and slaves did not receive any kind of compensation from owners or assistance from the state.
Before the abolition of slavery, slaves were prohibited from owning assets or receiving an education; but after being freed, former slaves were left to make their own way in the world. Without education or political representation, slaves struggled to gain economic and social status in Brazilian society; this explains many of the social inequalities observed in Brazil through to the modern day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
The Lei Áurea was authored by Rodrigo A. da Silva, then Minister of Agriculture and member of the Chamber of Deputies, and, after passing both houses of the National Assembly (Assembléia Geral), it was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), who was Regent at the time, while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. The Golden Law was signed by the Princess Imperial and countersigned by Rodrigo A. da Silva, in his capacity as Minister of Agriculture. Isabel was awarded the "Golden Rose" by Pope Leo XIII and Minister Rodrigo A. da Silva received honors from the Vatican, France and Portugal. In August 1888 Rodrigo A. da Silva went on to be chosen for a lifetime seat in the Senate of the Empire.
Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves – Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Brazilian government was also under pressure from Britain, who sought to end the slave trade in order to expand production in its own colonies. For example, sugar was produced both in Brazil and in the British colonies of the West Indies; the British strove to ensure that the Brazilians would gain no advantage in the world markets by using slaves.
The Lei Áurea had other consequences besides the freeing of all slaves; without slaves and lacking workers, the plantation owners (fazendeiros) had to recruit workers elsewhere and thus organized, in the 1890s, the  Sociedade Promotora de Imigração ("Society for the Promotion of Immigration)". Another effect was an uproar among Brazilian slave owners and upper classes, resulting in the toppling of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic in 1889 – indeed, the Lei Áurea is often regarded as the most immediate (but not the only) cause of the fall of monarchy in Brazil.

Villanova Stadium is a stadium located on the campus of Villanova University in Radnor Township, Pennsylvania, USA.
Villanova Stadium was originally built in 1927 and dedicated on October 8, 1927. Villanova Stadium plays host to a wide variety of events including serving as home to the Villanova Wildcats football, field hockey, lacrosse, and track and field teams. Philadelphia area teams such as the WUSA's Philadelphia Charge and Major League Lacrosse's Philadelphia Barrage have also used the stadium in the past or currently. In the 1960s, Monsignor Bonner High School, like Villanova an Augustinian school, used the field.
The field and track at Villanova Stadium are known as "Goodreau Field" and "Jumbo Elliott Track," respectively.  On May 7, 1930, the playing field at Villanova Stadium was dedicated to the memory of Leo J. Francis Goodreau, a Villanova football player who died due to injuries incurred in practice.  On September 27, 1980, the running track was dedicated to Villanova's legendary track and field coach James "Jumbo" Elliott.
In Fall 1999, the Stadium underwent a face-lift with the Stadium Renovation Project. Included in this project was a state of the art press box, in addition to housing an 80-person meeting room for all Villanova Athletic Department personnel to use. The former AstroTurf playing field was replaced during the spring of 2002 with a synthetic grass surface known as AstroPlay.  The stadium received a new scoreboard along with a new playing surface for the Fall 2009 sport seasons.  The stadium seats 12,500.

[[Feature structure]]
CATEGORIES: Grammar

In phrase structure grammars, such as generalised phrase structure grammar, head-driven phrase structure grammar and lexical functional grammar, a feature structure is essentially a set of attribute-value pairs. For example the attribute named number might have the value singular. The value of an attribute may be either atomic, e.g. the symbol singular, or complex (most commonly a feature structure, but also a list or a set). 
A feature structure can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the nodes corresponding to the variable values and the paths to the variable names. Operations defined on feature structures, e.g. unification, are used extensively in phrase structure grammars. In most theories (e.g. HPSG), operations are strictly speaking defined over equations describing feature structures and not over feature structures themselves, though feature structures are usually used in informal exposition.
Often, feature structures are written like this:
Here there are the two features category and agreement. Category has the value noun phrase whereas the value of agreement is indicated by another feature structure with the features number and person being singular and third.
This particular notation is called  attribute value matrix (AVM).
The matrix has two columns, one for the feature names and the other for the values. In this sense a feature structure is a list of key-value pairs. The value might be atomic or another feature structure.  This leads to another notation for feature structures: the use of trees. In fact, some systems (such as PATR-II) use S-expressions to represent feature structures.

CATEGORIES: Economic history of Canada, Roads in Ontario, Roads in Quebec, Types of roads, Roads in Canada by type

In Upper and Lower Canada, concession roads were laid out by the colonial government through undeveloped Crown land to provide access to rows of newly surveyed lots intended for farming by new settlers. The land that comprised a row of lots that spanned the entire length of a new township was "conceded" by the Crown for this purpose (hence, a "concession of land"). Title to an unoccupied lot was awarded to an applicant in exchange for raising a house, performing roadwork and land clearance, and monetary payment.[tpl]cite web|last=McIlwraith|first=Thomas R.|title=Concession line|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/concession-line|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 November 2012[/tpl] Concession roads and cross-cutting sidelines or side roads were laid out in an orthogonal (rectangular or square) grid plan, often aligned so that concession roads ran (approximately) parallel to the north shore of Lake Ontario, or to the southern boundary line of a county. In a common square grid layout known as a 1,000 Acre Sectional System, adjacent parallel roads were 100 chains or [tpl]convert|1.25|mi|km|1[/tpl] apart, and arranged as 10 100-acre lots each 20 chains by 50 chains
so that two consecutive concession roads and two consecutive side roads enclosed a square of [tpl]convert|1,000|acre|km2|0[/tpl]. Other plans used during colonial surveying used different layouts and lot sizes of 100, 150, 160, 200 or 320 acres [tpl]cite web|last=Weaver|first=W.F.|url=http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@osg/documents/document/stdu_130769.pdf|work=Crown Surveys in Ontario|publisher=Government of Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl]. 
Concession roads were typically numbered consecutively. The first concession road in a township, though, was often called the baseline (from the surveying term), and roads so named remain in many municipalities, including Ottawa, Clarington and London; the first concession road was also frequently called the front, or broken front if it was on a lake shore.
In some townships, such as those in Bruce County, each side of each successive concession road comprised a separate numbered concession. Thus, the south side of a road might be Concession 2 and the north side Concession 3. In this system, for the purposes of road signing only even (or, sometimes, odd) numbers were used, so that concession roads were successively numbered, e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc. This simplified the address numbering of farm lots, especially along township boundary roads where opposite sides of the same road were in  different townships. Where even numbers were used, the numbers of odd-numbered concessions would appear only in property records (e.g., Lot 18, Concession 11, Brant Township, which would be on the north side of Concession Road 10).
Many of the "sideline" roads still preserve "Line" in their names. Guelph Line, 12th Line, and Brown's Line are important thoroughfares in and west of Toronto. The "side road" name survives on several roads in Ontario as well.  
Side road or sideline numbering varies depending on the township. Sideline roads in many townships in Bruce County, for example, are numbered in multiples of 5, i.e., starting with the town line (road on township boundary), then numbered 5th, 10th, 15th, and so on, with five lots between each pair of successive sidelines in the original township survey. In some townships, the "line road" name was applied to the roads that elsewhere were called "concession roads", i.e., roads that ran between two adjacent concessions.
Many concession roads retain their original names.  Less developed areas are often referred to as "back concessions".
In most of Upper Canada this layout of roads preceded urban development, so that most Ontario municipalities now have grid patterns of streets. In cities, many concession roads have become major streets.

[[Streetsville Secondary School]]

CATEGORIES: Peel District School Board, High schools in Mississauga, Educational institutions established in 1958

Streetsville Secondary School is a high school in the Peel District School Board located in the Streetsville community of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.
Streetsville Secondary School was opened in 1958. The school has 899 students, and of the 899, 325 are French Immersion. As of December 2013, twenty one students are bused in.
The school features a main floor and a second floor on its north side. It has two gymnasiums, one large in size, and the second being half the size of the first. When the school first opened, the smaller gym was originally intended to be a swimming pool. The school has a library, which was recently renovated and expanded, and a cafeteria.
The school has several unusual classes including Grade 11 and 12 Photographic Arts, the unusual aspect being the darkroom available for student use, one of the last remaining in the Peel school system. Also available to students is Music Production, a course teaching the recording and mastering of music using computers. 
In 2005, the French immersion programme for students was introduced at Streetsville Secondary School where students can learn bilingualism in Canada. The courses offered are: French Immersion (Grades 9-12), Science and Geography of Canada (Grade 9), Contemporary Canadian History, Career Studies, and Civics (Grade 10), World History to the 16th Century (Grade 11), and Canadian and World Issues: A Geographic Analysis (Grade 12).
Up until summer of 2005, the school had 13 portable buildings. However, in 2005, Mississauga Secondary School opened in the area and about half of the grade 9 and 10 students attending Streetsville had to switch schools due to boundary changes. This dropped the overall attendance by about 500, and all of the portables have been removed (not including the permanent portapac attached to the building). The sole portable remaining was used as an extension of the school's drama room until it was removed in 2006 due to budget cuts.

It is estimated that in 1900 about 95% of Africa's inhabitants south of Sahara lived from the primary occupations of farming, hunting & gathering, cattle nomadism, and fishing (Aase, 2003:1) meaning that less than 5% were urban. In 1950 (the start of the independence period) 14.7% of Africa's inhabitants were urban, in 2000 had it risen to 37.2% and it is expected to rise to 45.3% in 2015, in effect 3.76% ? 3.35% per year (UN, 2002). The Nigerian city of Lagos that in 1963 had 665 000 inhabitants (Rakodi, 1997) and 8.7 million in 2000 is expected to become the worlds 11th biggest city by 2015 with 16 million inhabitants (UN, 2002).

[[Lost luggage]]
CATEGORIES: Civil aviation, Luggage, Lost objects

Lost luggage is luggage conveyed by a public carrier such as an airline, seafaring cruise ship, shipping company, or railway which fails to arrive at the correct destination with the passenger. In the United States, an average of 1 in 150 people have their checked baggage misdirected or left behind each year.
Lost or misdirected luggage is more likely if the journey has several legs, involving changing planes once or more. There are many causes of lost luggage. If a passenger arrives late for a flight, there may not be time for their luggage to be loaded onto the plane. If tags are accidentally torn off, the airport may not know where to send the luggage. Human error is also common: tags may be misread or luggage put in the wrong place. Sometimes there is no room in the plane or weight problems. Security delays can also cause bags to arrive on a later flight than their owner. Luggage is taken through customs after its owner claims it.
Most lost luggage is quickly sent by the airline to the correct destination. Airlines will often reimburse passengers for toiletries, clothing, and other essentials if the arrival airport is away from the passenger's home area. In most cases, when delayed luggage arrives, a courier service will deliver it to the passenger's home or hotel. The airline usually pays for this.
In case of lost luggage, travelers are advised to carry all essentials in a carry-on bag, including a change of clothes and anything they would be greatly troubled to lose because of its monetary or emotional value (this excludes security restricted items, that can not be carried inside the passenger cabin). Occasionally luggage is completely lost and cannot be recovered. The airline will then normally compensate the owner. The passenger must then list the contents of their baggage and file a claim.
Bags can also be damaged during travel, but most damage (such as broken wheels and handles) is not covered under the airlines' contract of carriage. Some airlines, however, will still repair such damage as a good faith gesture, or offer a discount voucher for a future flight. In general airlines regard the purpose of luggage to be the protection of its contents during transit. If the luggage is damaged, even severely, but the contents are unharmed, then airlines regard the luggage as having fulfilled its purpose and will not compensate owners.

For example, if a person, place, or thing has the same name as another - especially if they are named after another person, place, or thing, then the name target is said to be the namesake of the name source. The earliest use reported in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1635. Dictionaries suggest that the word probably comes from "name's sake", "for one's name('s) sake", for "name sake".

Many take the form of a large rectangular card with "windows" of which there are usually 24: one for each day of December leading up to Christmas Day. The doors are opened starting with the first one. Consecutive doors are opened every day leading up to Christmas. The calendar windows open to reveal an image, poem, a portion of a story (such as the story of the Nativity of Jesus) or a small gift, such as a toy or a chocolate item.

Funnel cake is a regional food popular in North America at carnivals, fairs, sporting events, and seaside resorts.
Funnel cakes are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil in a circular pattern and deep frying the overlapping mass until golden-brown. When made at concession stands, a pitcher with an integral funnel spout is employed.
Funnel cakes are typically served plain with powdered sugar, or with jam, cinnamon, Nutella, fresh fruit, or other toppings. 
In North America, funnel cakes were originally associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch region.
In south German cuisine the equivalent is called Strauben and is made and served similarly. In Slovenian cuisine they are called flancati ([tpl]IPA-sl|ˈflantsati[/tpl]). In Finnish cuisine the analogous tippaleipä is traditionally served at May Day (Vappu) celebrations. In Ripon, North Yorkshire, it is also known as "Fennel Funnel Pie"[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]. In the Indian subcontinent a similar dessert is called jalebi which has a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating; in Iran this would be known as zulbia and is a popular dessert.
According to one website a 6 inch (150 mm) diameter funnel cake has fewer than 300 calories[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/generic/funnel-cake |title=Calories in Funnel Cake and Nutrition Facts |publisher=Fatsecret.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl] though most funnel cakes are closer to [tpl]convert|9|in[/tpl] in diameter.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Funnel cake can vary dramatically in its caloric content, depending upon which toppings are added.

John Barton "Bart" King (October 19, 1873 – October 17, 1965) was an American cricketer, active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King was part of the Philadelphia team that played from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I. This period of cricket in the United States was dominated by "gentlemen cricketers"—men of independent wealth who did not need to work. King, an amateur from a middle-class family, was able to devote time to cricket thanks to a job set up by his teammates.
A skilled batsman who proved his worth as a bowler, King set numerous records in the continent of North America during his career and led the first-class bowling averages in England in 1908.[tpl]cite book | last = Rolfe | first = John |title=Everything You Want to Know About Sports (Sports Illustrated for Kids) |publisher=Bantam Books for Young Readers |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-553-48166-5 [/tpl] He successfully competed against the best cricketers from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called the "angler", and helped develop the art of swing bowling in the sport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html |title=SABR UK Examiner no.10: Baseball and Cricket: Cross-Currents |accessdate=2007-01-31 |last=Synge |first=Allen |year=2007 |publisher=Society for American Baseball Research (UK Chapter) | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070208042929/http://www.sabruk.org/examiner/10/cricket.html| archivedate= February 8, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Sir Pelham Warner described Bart King as "one of the finest bowlers of all time",[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234625.html |title=Wisden – 1966 – Obituaries in 1965 |accessdate=2007-01-31 |year=1966 |publisher=John Wisden & Co [/tpl] and Donald Bradman called him "America's greatest cricketing son."[tpl]cite book | last = Bradman | first = Donald | authorlink = | title = The Art of Cricket | publisher = Robson Books | year = 1998[/tpl]

It was held in Sydney, Australia from 17 September through to the bronze and gold medal games on 27 September. Two venues were used for the Games: the Sydney Baseball Stadium and Blacktown Olympic Park. For the first time in Olympic competition, professional baseball players were eligible to participate, though no active players from Major League Baseball were available.[tpl]cite journal | author=Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games | year=2001 | title=Official Report of the XXVII Olympiad | url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v2.pdf | publisher=Paragon Printers Australasia | pages=176–9 | location=Canberra, Australia | accessdate=15 September 2010 | volume= 2: Celebrating the Games | isbn=0-9579616-0-X | format=PDF | ref=refSOCOG [/tpl]

[[Icelandic presidential election, 2004]]
CATEGORIES: Presidential elections in Iceland, 2004 elections in Europe, 2004 in Iceland

A presidential election was held in Iceland on Saturday, 26 June 2004.
Traditionally, Icelandic presidential elections in which the incumbent president indicates a wish to obtain a new mandate are uncontested. The current president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, was first elected in 1996 with 40.9% of the vote, in an election with an 85.9% turnout contested by four candidates. In 2000 he was re-elected without opposition. When Ólafur Ragnar announced his intention to seek another mandate in 2004, two other candidates emerged:
Unlike parliamentary elections in Iceland, presidential elections are not fought on the basis of party politics; instead, candidates attempt to use their personalities to attract supporters and appear as a living symbol of national unity.
By tradition, the presidency is an almost entirely powerless office, as the presidents almost never use the powers granted to them by the constitution, instead just exercising moral authority.  Ólafur Ragnar, however, has expressed a wish to have a public discussion on the role of the head of state. Unprecedentedly in the history of the Icelandic Republic, on 2 June 2004 Ólafur Ragnar vetoed a media ownership law passed by the Althing. Davíð Oddsson, who was Prime Minister at the time, claimed that the veto was tainted because the president's daughter worked for Baugur Group, which had recently acquired roughly half of the country's media. There was little doubt that Ólafur Ragnar would be re-elected, but the veto controversy had an effect on the voting – the unprecedentedly high number of empty ballots (20.6% of the total) was thought to be largely a protest of the veto.

[[LGBT themes in speculative fiction]]

CATEGORIES: LGBT speculative fiction, Science fiction culture, Sexuality and society

LGBT themes in speculative fiction refer to the incorporation of  lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres.[tpl]Ref label|Note1|a|a[/tpl] Such elements may include an LGBT character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the hetero-cisnormative.
Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.
Before the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.
From the 1980s onwards, homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the LGBT community. This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.

[[Genesis '88]]

CATEGORIES: Acid house, Rave, Rave culture in the United Kingdom

Genesis'88 was a party promotion crew who threw some of the first acid house parties also known as raves in the United Kingdom from 1988 to 1992.
It was founded during 1988 during the U.K's discovery of acid house. They were an organisation that staged acid house parties in empty industrial warehouses in London and within the M25 motorway area. "Over the course of 1989, promoters such as World Dance, Genesis, Helter Skelter and Energy succeeded in setting acid house nights free of the urban core's constructions, staging ever more elaborate Orbital parties in borrowed and rented fields, the odd warehouse, or some other similarly vacant structure". Clover, J. 1989: Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about. p. 64 At that point in time acid house parties were deemed illegal by authorities because most promoters of the period gained entrance into buildings by breaking and entering.

It lies in the Ladybrook Valley on the Cheshire Plain, and the drift consists mostly of boulder clay, sands and gravels. As of the 2001 census, it had a population of 29,000.
Evidence of Bronze Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity, including coins, jewellery and axes, has been discovered locally. The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was a large estate which included neighbouring Cheadle. In the early 14th century it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle, respectively. The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Unlike many English villages it did not grow around a church; instead it formed from several hamlets, many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme. In the late 19th century Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle, Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a distinct place in its own right, as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.
Cheadle Hulme remains an affluent part of the Metropolitan Borough, with its own schools, open parkland, historical landmarks such as Bramall Hall, shopping areas, and local businesses. These are sustained by its railway station, and its close proximity to Manchester Airport and major roads such as the A34.

[[Orchestrated objective reduction]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mind, Theories of mind

Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) is a controversial 20-year-old theory of consciousness conceptualized by the theoretical physicist Sir Roger Penrose and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, which claims that consciousness derives from deeper level, finer scale quantum activities inside the cells, most prevalent in the brain neurons.  It combines approaches from the radically different angles of molecular biology, neuroscience, quantum physics, pharmacology, philosophy, quantum information theory, and aspects of quantum gravity.
While mainstream theories assume consciousness to emerge from complex computations performed by communicating cerebral neurons through synapses, Orch-OR posits that consciousness is based on non-computable quantum processing performed by qubits formed collectively on the microtubules of the cells, a process significantly amplified in the neurons.  The qubits are based on oscillating dipoles forming superimposed resonance rings in helical pathways throughout microtubule lattices. The oscillations are either electric, due to charge separation from London forces, or most favorably magnetic, due to electron spin—and possibly also due to nuclear spins (which can remain isolated for longer periods of time), and occur in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz frequency ranges.
 The orchestration refers to the hypothetical process by which connective proteins, such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), influence or orchestrate the state reduction of the qubits by modifying the spacetime-separation of their superimposed states.  The later is based on the Diósi-Penrose scheme for interpreting quantum mechanics, which postulates the existence of an objective threshold governing the collapse of quantum-states, related to the difference of the space-time curvature of these states in the fine scale structure of the universe.
The basis of Orch-OR has been harshly criticized from its inception by mainstream mathematicians,LaForte, Geoffrey, Patrick J. Hayes, and Kenneth M.

Pyramid is a gaming magazine, publishing articles primarily on role-playing games, but including board games, card games, and other sorts of games. It began life in 1993 as a print publication of Steve Jackson Games for its first 30 issues, though it has been published on the Internet since March 1998. Print issues were bimonthly; the first online version published new articles each week; the second online version is monthly. Pyramid replaced Steve Jackson Games' previous magazine Roleplayer.
Pyramid features general gaming articles by freelance authors, as well as Designer's Notes by Steve Jackson Games product developers, industry news, cartoons, and gaming product reviews. Although articles tend to concentrate on Steve Jackson Games products such as GURPS, it has published articles on other games such as d20 System, Talisman, Nobilis, Hero System, and has featured various comic strips and single-panel cartoons (currently Murphy's Rules). Steve Jackson Games also briefly published another online magazine, d20 Weekly for several months using a very similar model to that of Pyramid. However, the venture was not a success, and was eventually folded into a slightly expanded Pyramid.
The online subscription system used for Pyramid also granted access to subscriber forums, a dedicated chat server, and occasional pre-publication playtest material for Steve Jackson Games and other companies' products. In 2008 this was changed: Pyramid is available as a PDF download from e23, and the subscriber forums have been discontinued. Access to playtest material is contingent on participation in an actual playtest.

[[Royal Albert DLR station]]

CATEGORIES: Docklands Light Railway stations in Newham, Railway stations opened in 1994

Royal Albert DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the Docklands area of east London. The station serves the western end of the north quay of the Royal Albert Dock, from which it takes its name. A view of the London City Airport is available.
The station is located on an elevated section of the DLR's Beckton branch, between Prince Regent and Beckton Park stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.
The station was opened in 1994. There was previously a station called Connaught Road on the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway in the same area but this closed in 1940.
The station is further from the nearest houses than any other on the DLR, despite which it has a steady patronage from those living in the area of Beckton to the north. In fact the station signage is subtitled "For West Beckton". However, the access route from these houses to the station, crossing the busy Royal Albert Way on the level, is notably substandard, the only footbridge being some distance away.
Following the relocation of many London Borough of Newham council staff to the Building 1000 offices adjoining the station, usage has increased substantially during office hours.
During problems, Royal Albert acts as a terminus with a shuttle between Royal Albert and Beckton. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] This is possible because there is a crossover to the west of the station.
The station serves the London Regatta Centre and Royal Docks Business Park which houses Newham Council.

Going Postal is Terry Pratchett's 33rd Discworld novel, released in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2004. Unlike most of Pratchett's Discworld novels,  Going Postal is divided into chapters, a feature previously seen only in Pratchett's children's books and the Science of Discworld series. These chapters begin with a synopsis of philosophical themes, in a similar manner to some Victorian novels and, notably, to Jules Verne stories. The title refers to both the contents of the novel, as well as to the term 'going postal'.
The book was on the shortlist for both the Nebula and Locus Awards for Best (Fantasy) Novel. It would also have been shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, except that Pratchett withdrew it, as he felt stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of the Worldcon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/a218.html|title=Ansible 218|date=5 September 2005|author=Dave Langford[/tpl]The 2005 Hugo Nominees (fiction) This was the first time Pratchett had been shortlisted for either award.

László Rajk (March 8, 1909 Székelyudvarhely – October 15, 1949 Budapest)  was a Hungarian Communist; politician, former Minister of Interior and former Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was an important organizer of the Hungarian communist's power (for example, organized the State Protection Authority (ÁVH)); but he eventually fell victim to Rákosi's show trials, probably, apart from the Communist parties' endemic power struggles, because he was a homegrown Communist, as opposed to the Stalin-backed Rákosi.

[[Joe Brown (climber)]]

CATEGORIES: 1930 births, Living people, British rock climbers, English mountain climbers, Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, People from Ardwick

Joseph Brown (usually called Joe Brown) CBE (born 26 September 1930) is an English climber, born the seventh and last child of a family in the Manchester suburb of Ardwick."Joe Brown Biography."Joe-Brown.com.Web.7May,2012. Brown was the first in his family to climb: aged 12, he and his friends began exploring from camp sites. Unlike other climbers, he and his friends used discarded clothes lines that were unreliable to use even for clothes. Brown was employed by a company called Archies, where he was apprenticed to a plumber and general builder."Joe Brown Biography."Joe-Brown.com.Web.8May,2012. He became famous for climbing during the 1950s, and was a member of the Valkyrie climbing club and founding member of the Rock and Ice climbing club.[tpl]cite book|last=Thompson|first=Simon|title=Unjustifiable Risk?|year=2010|publisher=Cicerone|pages=207–209[/tpl] An early climbing partner was Don Whillans, a fellow Mancunian and a plumber. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from working-class backgrounds, in contrast to the upper and middle-class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the Second World War.
Brown, still with his passion for climbing, was enlisted in 1949-50 for 18 months in the Ordnance Corps, where he spent his free time climbing with his friends. Brown suffered one of many accidents when not climbing when he broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn. However, this did not hold him down as he was back up and climbing three months later.
Brown is widely regarded as the outstanding pioneering English rock climber of the 1950s and early 1960s.  He established an unprecedented number of classic new routes (especially in Snowdonia and the Peak District) that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. Examples on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass include "Cenotaph Corner" (1952, graded E1, with Doug Belshaw) and "Cemetery Gates" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans). As well as creating pioneering routes, he often helped create new types of "protection" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first "nuts" by drilling the thread out of nuts and threading the centre with a sling. So famous was he that the Post Office would often deliver letters simply addressed to "The Human Fly, UK".[tpl]fact|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In this context, Brown's mountaineering achievements in the Alps and Himalaya have often been overlooked: he made many significant ascents in the Alps in the 1950s with Don Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the third highest mountain in the world, Kangchenjunga in the Nepalese Himalaya, with George Band. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the Mustagh Tower in the Karakoram with Ian McNaught-Davis. The other members of the team, John Hartog and Tom Patey, reached the main summit the next day.
Apart from his numerous classic rock climbs in Britain, and his considerable mountaineering achievements abroad, Brown is remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s, three in Snowdonia, and then, in 1967, a spectacular new route on the Old Man of Hoy, a Scottish sea stack, with luminaries of the climbing world Ian McNaught-Davis and Sir Chris Bonington. Fifteen years later Brown repeated the climb on the Old Man on a popular TV documentary with his second daughter Zoe. Her bubbly personality led her to being chosen as a presenter on the children's TV show Razzamatazz.
Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Brown was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to rock climbing and mountaineering.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |startpage=7 |supp=yes [/tpl]
On February 17, 1957 Brown married Valerie Melville Gray, who without her involvement with the climbing fraternity, would never have been able to understand Joe and his passion for climbing. Throughout his climbing career Brown was involved in many films such as Hazard, Upstairs Down Wales, Five Days One Summer, in which he and other British climbers assisted with the mountaineering scenes. In 1960 came his first daughter Helen and six years later his second daughter, Zoe. She later repeated a climb for a TV show. Brown started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened his own shop, since expanded to three shops in Snowdonia and an online presence, branded in English as "Joe Brown shops" and in Welsh as "Siopau Joe Brown" (joe-brown.com).  This is not to be confused with the later and unconnected "Joe Browns" (joebrowns.co.uk) online clothing store.

Atenolol is a selective β1 receptor antagonist, a drug belonging to the group of beta blockers (sometimes written β-blockers), a class of drugs used primarily in cardiovascular diseases. Introduced in 1976, atenolol was developed as a replacement for propranolol in the treatment of hypertension. It works by slowing down the heart and reducing its workload. Unlike propranolol, atenolol does not pass through the blood–brain barrier thus avoiding various central nervous system side effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Agon P, Goethals P, Van Haver D, Kaufman JM |title=Permeability of the blood–brain barrier for atenolol studied by positron emission tomography |journal=J.

Atenolol is one of the most widely used β-blockers in the United Kingdom and was once the first-line treatment for hypertension. The role for β-blockers in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they perform less appropriately or effectively than newer drugs, particularly in the elderly.

[[Finnish hip hop]]

CATEGORIES: Finnish hip hop

Finnish hip hop or rap ([tpl]lang-fi|suomiräp, räp[/tpl]) or (suomirap, rap) is a variant of hip hop music from Finland. The rapping (räppäys) is  mainly done in Finnish. Many rappers use Helsinki slang words, general slang and Finnish dialects are used too by some artists. Many early rappers ([tpl]lang-fi|räppäri[/tpl]) used English language. Some Finnish rap was already recorded in the early 1980s and some popular artists emerged in the early 1990s but it was not until the 2000s that it became finally a more lasting phenomenon in a form of wider scene and numerous popular performers.
The first recorded Finnish rap song was song "I'm Young, Beautiful and Natural" in English language which was made by artist called General Njassa in 1983. Rap music in Finnish language made its first breakthrough in 1990 when groups Raptori and Pääkköset and artist Nikke T got their records to Finnish charts. Especially Raptori created a nationwide phenomenon. These artists had a style greatly different when compared to American rap music. Their music was highly influenced by the dance pop of the 1980s and their approach to music was largely humouristic. Later Finnish rappers tend to despise this wave of early 1990s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] Niko Toiskallio (Nikke T) himself has later stated that he regrets his humoristic dance-influenced rap recordings and he claims that so-called humour-rap deprived the credibility of Finnish rap scene which did not recover until many years later in the late 1990s.http://www.ylioppilaslehti.fi/2007/05/11/luova-krapula/ Ylioppilaslehti (the weekly paper of university students), 2007, 5.11
Even though Murmurecordings collective with its most popular group Ceebrolistics had made conscious and abstract hip hop throughout the 1990s, it was Fintelligens who started the new wave of Finnish rap in the late 1990s, and soon many other groups followed. Finnish rap was again seen on national record charts. This time Finnish rappers used a style which was much closer to American hip hop music. Popular artists and groups of this era included Asa (then known as Avain), Ezkimo, Flegmaatikot, Kapasiteettiyksikkö, Paleface, Seremoniamestari and Tulenkantajat. These got their albums published by large record companies.
These days many Finnish rappers release their music as self-published albums or through small indie labels such as Monsp, 3rd Rail Music, Rähinä Records or Numbers Entertainment. Also some of these artists have climbed to official music charts, for example Ruudolf, Kemmuru, DJPP, Notkea Rotta, Steen1, Reilukerho, Jontti & Shaka, Hannibal ja Soppa, Gee, Elastinen & Iso H, Trilogia, Cheek, Stig, Eevil Stöö and Koksukoo.
Finnish rappers can be divided into underground and mainstream. Underground rappers rap about suburbs, drugs, politics, life, problems with authorities and so on.  Mainstream rappers rap about partying, women and cars.

[[Atrophy]]

CATEGORIES: Anatomical pathology, Gross pathology

Atrophy (from Ancient Greek ἀτροφία atrophia, "a wasting away", from ἀ- a-, "not" and τροφή trophē, "food") is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body. Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor circulation, loss of hormonal support, loss of nerve supply to the target organ, excessive amount of apoptosis of cells, and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. Hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are referred to as trophic noun in medical practice ('trophic" is an adjective that can be paired with various nouns). Trophic describes the trophic condition of tissue. A diminished muscular trophic is designated as atrophy.
Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues, involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support due to other disease, it is termed pathological atrophy, although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well.

Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying upon the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem. Muscle can also be stiffened.

CATEGORIES: Medical treatments

Debridement [tpl]IPAc-en|d|ɨ|ˈ|b|r|iː|d|m|ə|n|t[/tpl] http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/debridementis the medical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. Removal may be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (self-digestion), and by maggot therapy, where certain species of live maggots selectively eat only necrotic tissue.
In oral hygiene and dentistry, debridement refers to the removal of plaque and calculus that have accumulated on the teeth. Debridement in this case may be performed using ultrasonic instruments, which fracture the calculus, thereby facilitating its removal, as well as hand tools, including periodontal scaler and curettes, or through the use of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide.
In podiatry practitioners such as chiropodists, podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove callus, corns,  verrucas etc.
Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites.
Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For example, when excising a tumor, there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected, and if not removed, could cause a relapse. In such circumstances, a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue — as little as possible — to ensure that the tumor is completely removed.

M-52 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus is on the Ohio border, where it continues as State Route 109 (SR 109).  The highway passes through communities like Adrian, where it intersects US Highway 223 (US 223), Chelsea and Webberville along its [tpl]convert|127.300|mi|km|3[/tpl] course. It crosses some major rivers, including the River Raisin and the Shiawassee. The section of the highway between M-50 and Manchester was built as a limited-access highway. M-52's northern terminus is at M-46, [tpl]convert|9|mi|km|spell=in[/tpl] west of Saginaw. 
Adrian previously converted their downtown streets to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings of the two state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US 223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.
M-52 is an original state trunkline highway, dating to the 1919 formation of the system. Other segments of the modern routing were designated M-92 and M-47 at the time. Extensions to M-52 supplanted M-92 completely and M-47 partially along their routings. These extensions completed the modern M-52 routing in the late 1960s.

Ilha Tupinambarana is the name of a former fluvial island bordered by rivers of the Amazon system (Amazon, Madeira, Sucunduri, and Abacaxis) in eastern Amazonas, Brazil.  Today, it has been split into four completely separate parts by natural channels, just like those isolating it from the mainland--it is no longer one island, but four.  The original island stretched from the municipalities of Parintins, in the northeast, to Nova Olinda do Norte, in the southwest. The combined area of the islands is to 11,850 km², making Ilha Tupinambarana the second largest fluvial group of islands in the world after Bananal Island.

[[Diathermy]]
CATEGORIES: Medical equipment

In the natural sciences, the term diathermy di´ah-ther″me means "electrically induced heat" the use of high-frequency electromagnetic currents as a form of physical or occupational therapy and in surgical procedures. The term diathermy is derived from the Greek words dia and therma, and literally means “heating through.” adj., adj diather´mal, diather´mic.
It is commonly used for muscle relaxation. It is also a method of heating tissue electromagnetically or ultrasonically for therapeutic purposes in medicine. Diathermy is used in physical therapy and occupational therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body.
Diathermy, whether achieved using short-wave radio frequency (range 1–100 MHz) or microwave energy (range 434–915 MHz), exerts physical effects and elicits a spectrum of physiological responses, the two methods differing mainly for their penetration capability.[tpl]cite book|author=Mark Dutton|title=Physical Therapist Assistant Exam Review Guide|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fISkTGGX2XUC&pg=PA468&dq=thermo+penetratin+diathermy#v=onepage&q=thermo%20penetratin%20diathermy&f=false|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-7637-9757-7|pages=468–[/tpl]
Surgically, the extreme heat that can be produced by diathermy may be used to destroy neoplasms, warts, and infected tissues, and to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye.

[[Terminal illness]]

CATEGORIES: Medical terminology, Palliative medicine, Death

[tpl]about|incurable disease|the alternative definition of eyestrain|computer vision syndrome|other uses|Terminal (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Terminal[/tpl]
Terminal illness is a medical term commonly used to refer to a disease that will result in the death of the patient regardless of any treatment intervention.
A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient, terminally ill or simply terminal. Often, a patient is considered terminally ill when their estimated life expectancy is six months or less, under the assumption that the disease will run its normal course. The six-month standard is arbitrary,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/terminal.asp |title=Terminal Illness |accessdate=2008-02-09 |format= |work=[/tpl] and best available estimates of longevity may be incorrect.  Consequently, though a given patient may properly be considered terminal, this is not a guarantee that the patient will die within six months.  Similarly, a patient with a slowly progressing disease, such as AIDS, may not be considered terminally ill because the best estimates of longevity were greater than six months. However this does not guarantee that the patient will not die unexpectedly early. In general, physicians slightly overestimate the survival time of terminally ill cancer patients, so that, for example, a person who is expected to live for about six weeks would likely die around four weeks.[tpl]cite journal |author=Glare P |title=A systematic review of physicians' survival predictions in terminally ill cancer patients |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7408 |pages=195–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12881260 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7408.195 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12881260 |pmc=166124 |author-separator=, |author2=Virik K |author3=Jones M |display-authors=3 |last4=Hudson |first4=M |last5=Eychmuller |first5=S |last6=Simes |first6=J |last7=Christakis |first7=N[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Numbered routes in Massachusetts, U.S. Route 1

Route 1A is a south–north state highway in Massachusetts. It is an alternate route to U.S. 1 with three signed sections and two unsigned sections where the highway is concurrent with its parent. Due to the reconfiguration of tunnel interchanges brought on by the completion of the Big Dig, Route 1A is discontinuous in the downtown Boston area. Vehicles entering Downtown Boston via the Sumner Tunnel must take I-93 north to the exit for Government Center and make a U-turn to access the entrance ramp to I-93 south (which silently carries Route 1A south as well) and vice versa.Executive Office of Transportation - Office of Transportation Planning Roads - June 2008 The older tunnels to and from East Boston have interchanges with I-93 and surface roads north of the point at which unsigned Route 1A "exits" Route 1 in downtown Boston. Unsigned Route 1A along the Fitzgerald Expressway does not directly connect to those tunnels; a direct connection requires using I-90 and the newer Ted Williams Tunnel, which is not concurrent with Route 1A at any point.

[[Kronecker product]]

CATEGORIES: Matrix theory

In mathematics, the Kronecker product, denoted by ⊗, is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. It is a generalization of the outer product (which is denoted by the same symbol) from vectors to matrices, and gives the matrix of the tensor product with respect to a standard choice of basis. The Kronecker product should not be confused with the usual matrix multiplication, which is an entirely different operation.
The Kronecker product is named after Leopold Kronecker, even though there is little evidence that he was the first to define and use it. Indeed, in the past the Kronecker product was sometimes called the Zehfuss matrix, after Johann Georg Zehfuss who described the matrix operation we now know as the Kronecker product in 1858.

Pietro Carrera, (July 12, 1573 – September 18, 1647) chess player, historian, priest and Italian author, born in Sicily, in Militello in Val di Catania (Province of Catania), located in the Valley of Noto; here he grew up in the old colony of San Vito. He was born on July 12, 1573, he was the son of Donna Antonia Severino (mother) and Mariano Carrera, a traditional craftsman who entered the priesthood after his wife's death. During his studies in the Seminario Diocesiano of Siracusa, he had the opportunity to visit many different Sicilian cities. As a result of his travels he met Paolo Boi, so-called "The Siracusan", in the town of Palermo during 1597.
After taking his vows, he first become the chaplain at the church of S. Maria della Stella and later of Francesco Branciforte's Court (the Prince of Pietraperzia and Marchese of Militello). During his stay at Branciforte's Court he become interested in chess, winning against Salvatore Albino the so-called "Beneventano" and against Geronimo Cascio. Cascio won against the famous but old Polerio. After developing a fond relationship with the Prince's wife, Lady Giovanna, he composed a short poem for her in Latin in exameter form regarding chess. Only fragments of this poem, the title being "The Pessopedia", remain today.
In 1617 he wrote and published Il Gioco degli Scacchi (The Game of Chess), subdivided into eight books where "learning the rules, the odds, the endgames, the blindfold chess and a discussion about the true origins of chess in itself". This was the first book ever printed in Militello, on request of the Princes of Butera, by Giovanni Rosso from Trento; in this poem Carrera collected and elaborated in a sistematic fashion information given by previous authors.
After the Prince of Branciforte's death, he moved to Messina, then to Canicattì and finally to Catania. Here in 1635, using an alias, he published the "Risposta di Valentino Vespaio contro l'apologia di Alessandro Salvio" ("Valentino Vespaio's answer against Alessandro Salvio's explanation"), where he debated the accusations and criticisms made against him from Salvio.
Famous and esteemed, he died on September 18, 1647 in Messina.
Carrera is also remembered as the inventor of chess variant (Carrera's chess) on an 8x10 chessboard, in which there were added two new pieces called the "Champion" (a combination of the moves of the tower (rook) and the knight) and "Centaurus" (a combination of the bishop and the knight); these innovations had more fame than the ones made by Piacenza and Marinelli.  It was a predecessor of Capablanca chess.
He is not remembered as a great live player but as a master of theory and a great source of information regarding contemporary players of his time.

[[Coin magic]]

CATEGORIES: Magic (illusion), Entertainment, Hobbies

Coin magic is the manipulating of coins to entertain audiences.[ref]

Money Magic, pp. 175-221.</ref> Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered as [[close-up magic]] or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as [[card magic]], and is one of the least performed forms of conjuring. Coin magic requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this takes a lot of practice to acquire.

The Royal Penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli) is a species of penguin, which can be found on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island and adjacent islands. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the Royal penguin as vulnerable. The scientific name commemorates the German zoologist Hermann Schlegel.
It is one of the crested penguins (a different genus to the similarly named King Penguin or Emperor Penguin). There is some controversy over whether Royal Penguins are a subspecies of Macaroni Penguins. Individuals of the two groups have been known to interbreed, though this is a relatively rare occurrence. Indeed, other penguins have been known to form mixed-species pairs in the wild.

[[Corporation (feudal Europe)]]
CATEGORIES: Feudalism

In feudal Europe, a corporation (from the Latin corpus, corporis a body) was an aggregation of business interests into a single legal body, entity or compact, usually with an explicit license from city, church, or national leaders.  These functioned as effective monopolies for a particular good or labor.
The term "corporation" was used as late as the 18th century in England to refer to such ventures as the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company: commercial organizations that operated under royal patent to have exclusive rights to a particular area of trade.  In the medieval town, however, corporations were a conglomeration of interests that existed either as a development from, or in competition with, guilds.  The most notable corporations were in trade and banking.
The effects of a corporation were similar to a monopoly.  On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., the ability to be an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy).  Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated.  (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by revoking the patent, but this rarely occurred.)

[[Power rating]]

CATEGORIES: Electrical parameters

In engineering, the power rating of a device is a guideline set by the manufacturer as a maximum power to be used with that device.  This limit is usually set somewhat lower than the level where the device will be damaged, to allow a margin of safety.
Note that this is the real or effective power dissipated in the device.
For motors (electrical or otherwise), their power rating is conventionally defined as their output (e.g. shaft) power, not their input power consumed.[tpl]cite book|author1=Anthony G. Atkins|author2=Tony Atkins|author3=Marcel Escudier|title=A Dictionary of Mechanical Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0TjtKmSIL48C&pg=PA269|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-958743-4|page=269[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Albert Thumann|title=Plant Engineers and Managers Guide to Energy Conservation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D7xO-d6gLUgC&pg=PA320|year=2010|publisher=The Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-657-1|page=320[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=William J. Eccles|title=Pragmatic Power|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HWntzQ4vY3kC&pg=PA74|year=2008|publisher=Morgan & Claypool Publishers|isbn=978-1-59829-798-0|page=74[/tpl]
In devices that primarily convert between different forms of electric power, such as transformers, or transport it from one location to another, such as transmission lines, the power rating almost always refers to the maximum power flow through the device, not dissipation within it. The usual reason for the limit is heat, and the maximum heat dissipation is calculated as above.
Power ratings are usually given in watts for real power and volt-amperes for apparent power, although for devices intended for use in large power systems, both may be given in a per-unit system. Cables are usually rated by giving their maximum voltage and their ampacity.[tpl]cite book|author=Mukund R. Patel|title=Introduction to Electrical Power and Power Electronics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Am5CI32itwAC&pg=PA54|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-5660-7|pages=54-55[/tpl] As the power rating depends on the method of cooling, different ratings may be specified for air cooling, water cooling, etc.
For AC-operated devices (e.g. coaxial cable, loudspeakers), there may be even be two power ratings, a maximum (peak) power ratting and an average power rating.[tpl]cite book|editor=Jerry C. Whitaker|title=The Electronics Handbook, Second Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FdSQSAC3_EwC&pg=PA314|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3666-4|pages=314-315[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Gary Davis|author2=Ralph Johnes|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&pg=PA232|year=1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-61774-545-4|page=232|edition=2nd[/tpl] For such devices, the peak power rating usually specifies the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average power rating limits high-frequency operation. Average power calculation rating depends on some assumptions how the device is going to be used. For example, the EIA rating method for loudspeakers uses a shaped noise signal that simulates music and allows peak excursion of 6dB, so a EIA rating of 50 Watts corresponds to 200 Watts peak rating.
In some fields of engineering, even a more complex set of power ratings is used. For example, helicopter engines are rated for continuous power (which does not have a time constraint), takeoff and hover power rating (defined as half to one hour operation), maximum contingency power (what can be sustained for two-three minutes), and emergency (half a minute) power rating.[tpl]cite book|author1=John M. Seddon|author2=Simon Newman|title=Basic Helicopter Aerodynamics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xUN75AXYhFgC&pg=PA231|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-119-97272-3|page=231|edition=3rd[/tpl]
For electrical motors, a similar kind of information is conveyed by the service factor, which is a multiplier applied to the (output) rated power that can sustained for shorter periods of time. The service factor is typically in the 1.15-1.4 range, with the figure being lower for higher-power motors. For every hour of operation at the service-factor-adjusted power rating, a motor loses two to three hours of life at nominal power, i.e. its service life is reduced to less than half for continued operation at this level.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael R. Lindeburg, PE|title=Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4P6jjodswwAC&pg=SA72-PA13|year=2013|publisher=www.ppi2pass.com|isbn=978-1-59126-414-9|pages=72–[/tpl] The service factor is defined in the ANSI/NEMA MG 1 standard,http://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/Contents%20and%20Forward%20MG%201.pdf and is generally used in the United States.[tpl]cite book|author1=Hamid A. Toliyat|author2=Gerald B.

Exceeding the power rating of a device by more than the margin of safety set by the manufacturer usually does damage to the device by causing its operating temperature to exceed safe levels.  In semiconductors, irreparable damage can occur very quickly.  Exceeding the power rating of most devices for a very short period of time is not harmful, although doing so regularly can sometimes cause cumulative damage.
Power ratings for electrical apparatus and transmission lines are a function of the duration of the proposed load and the ambient temperature; a transmission line or transformer, for example, can carry significantly more load in cold weather than in hot weather. Momentary overloads, causing high temperatures and deterioration of insulation, may be considered an acceptable trade-off in emergency situations. The power rating of switching devices varies depending on the circuit voltage as well as the current. In certain aerospace or military applications, a device may carry a much higher rating than would be accepted in devices intended to operate for long service life.

Manfred Bietak (born 6 October 1940, Vienna) is an Austrian archaeologist. He is Professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Vienna and  Director of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo 1973-2009. He is currently Chairman of the Vienna Institute of Archaeological Science at the University of Vienna and Chairman of the Commission for Egypt and the Levant at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1997 and 2006, he was Visiting Professor at the Collège de France; in 2004, he was Martha Whitcomb Visiting Professor at Harvard.
Bietak is best known as the director of the Austrian excavations at two sites in the Nile delta: Tell El-Dab'a, which was the location of Avaris, the capital of the Hyksos period;  and Piramesse, which was the capital of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The site was also most probably the naval base Peru-nefer of Thutmosis III and Amenhotep II. A palace precinct of those kings, furnished with Minoan frescoes was one of the most important discoveries. Bietak has also conducted excavations in western Thebes (Luqsor), where he discovered the huge tomb of Ankh-Hor, Chief steward of the Divine Wife of Amun Nitokris (26th Dynasty).

CATEGORIES: World Heritage Sites in Sweden, Lapland, National parks of Sweden, Geography of Norrbotten County

The Laponian area is a large mountainous wildlife area in the Lapland province in Northern Sweden, more precisely in the  Gällivare Municipality, Arjeplog Municipality and Jokkmokk Municipality.  It was made a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996; the bulk of it had enjoyed protected status since the early 20th century.
The total area is about 9400 km², making it the world's largest unmodified nature area to be still cultured by natives—the natives in this case being the reindeer herding Sami people also known as Lapps (though this term is considered derogatory). Only parts of the area is actually used for pasture by them. With such a large space, the geography of the area varies greatly; it is dominated by mountains, rivers and lakes.  Each nature reserve and national park has its distinctive features. The amount of snow in winter and rain in summer is considerable.
95% of the area is protected as national parks or nature reserves.  It consists of the national parks Muddus, Sarek, Padjelanta and Stora Sjöfallet, and the nature reserves Sjaunja and Stubba.  The remaining 5% are located in the areas of Sulitelma, Tjuoltadalen, and Rapadalen (part of which is in the Sarek park).  The village of Porjus is a natural point of entry to the Laponian area and has recently opened an information center.
The Laponia area also contains three major hydropower stations with belonging basins and a big expansion of 100 wind power stations inside the world heritage area is planned.
The highest mountain of the area is Sarektjåhkkå, at 2,089 meters.

 The Saturn V rocket, which sent astronauts to the Moon, used inertial guidance, a self-contained system that guided the rocket's trajectory.  The rocket booster had a guidance system separate from those on the command and lunar modules.  It was contained in an instrument unit like this one, a ring located between the rocket's third stage and the command and lunar modules.  The ring contained the basic guidance system components—a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics—as well as radar, telemetry, and other units.
The instrument unit's stable platform was based on an experimental unit for the German V-2 rocket of World War II. The Bendix Corporation produced the platform, while IBM designed and built the unit's digital computer.

M-99 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan.  It runs from the Ohio state border, where it connects to State Route 15 (SR 15), north to Lansing, where it terminates at a junction with Interstate 496 (I-496). The highway mainly serves local communities along the route as it passes through farm lands in the southern part of the state. One segment is routed concurrently with US Highway 12 (US 12) in Jonesville while the northern end runs through urban areas on a street named for Martin Luther King, Jr. in Lansing.
The current highway is the third to carry the M-99 designation. The others were located near Lake Michigan near Muskegon in the Lower Peninsula and Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula in the 1920s and 30s. The current highway was first designated as parts of M-34 and M-64 in 1919. These numbers were later dropped in favor of an M-9 designation in 1929. For part of 1934, a loop route was designated M-158 in Hillsdale County that was used for a rerouted M-9 in the area. The M-99 designation was applied to the highway in 1940. Since then, the state has completed paving twice; one segment was returned to gravel surface for two years in the 1950s. The southern section in Hillsdale County was rerouted in the 1960s, and sections were converted into divided highways in the late 1970s.

There are 26 branches in the system, most of them named after the neighborhoods in which they are located. Also included are Mobile Services and the Central Library (opened 2004, designed by Rem Koolhaas). The Seattle Public Library also founded, and until July 2008 administered, the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library (WTBBL).

NERVA is an acronym for Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application, a joint program of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and NASA managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) until both the program and the office ended at the end of 1972.
NERVA demonstrated that nuclear thermal rocket engines were a feasible and reliable tool for space exploration, and at the end of 1968 SNPO certified that the latest NERVA engine, the NRX/XE, met the requirements for a manned Mars mission. Although NERVA engines were built and tested as much as possible with flight-certified components and the engine was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft, much of the U.S. space program was cancelled by the Nixon Administration before a manned visit to Mars could take place.
NERVA was considered by the AEC, SNPO and NASA to be a highly successful program; it met or exceeded its program goals. Its principal objective was to "establish a technology base for nuclear rocket engine systems to be utilized in the design and development of propulsion systems for space mission application".Robbins, W.H. and Finger, H.B., "An Historical Perspective of the NERVA Nuclear Rocket Engine Technology Program", NASA Contractor Report 187154/AIAA-91-3451, NASA Lewis Research Center, NASA, July 1991.

The pilot episode[tpl]ref label|note01|a|^[/tpl] (also known as The One Where it All Began, The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate, and The First One) of the American situation comedy series Friends premiered on NBC (National Broadcasting Company) on September 22, 1994. It was written by series creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and directed by James Burrows. The pilot introduces six friends who live and work in New York City; Monica (Courteney Cox) sleeps with a wine seller after their first date but is horrified to discover he tricked her into bed; her brother Ross (David Schwimmer) is depressed after his lesbian ex-wife moves her things out of their apartment; Monica's old schoolfriend Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) moves in with Monica after running out of her wedding; and their friends, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe (Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and Lisa Kudrow) offer them each support and advice.
Crane and Kauffman pitched their original idea to network NBC in December 1993. NBC liked it and commissioned a complete script, which was submitted in March 1994. Before the script was finished, casting for the six main roles began; 75 actors were seen for each part. The pilot was taped on May 4, 1994 at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. After making final edits to the episode, executive producer Kevin Bright submitted it on May 11, two days before NBC was due to announce the schedule. Satisfied with the completed pilot, NBC ordered 12 more episodes for the first season. The episode was watched by approximately 22 million viewers, making it the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week. Critics compared the show unfavorably to Seinfeld and Ellen, noting the similarities all three series had in depicting friends conversing about their lives. The cast, particularly Schwimmer, were complimented, though there was some concern that the character roles were undeveloped.

The stadium opened on 26 September 1926 as the home ground for Lyn and several other local teams. The first international match was played in 1927, and NFF started gradually purchasing part of the stadium company. The peak attendance dates from 1935, when 35,495 people saw Norway play Sweden. Since 1948, Ullevaal has hosted the finals of the Norwegian Football Cup, and in 1967 the Japp Stand was completed. A new renovation started with the completion of the single-tier West Stand in 1985, and continued with the two-tier North and East Stands in 1990 and the South Stand in 1998. Ullevaal hosted the finals of the UEFA Women's Euro in 1987 and 1997.
In conjunction with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to Ullevål Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West Stand to increase capacity to 30,000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf.

Trichoplax adhaerens is the only extant representative of phylum Placozoa, which is a basal group of multicellular animals (metazoa). Trichoplax are very flat organisms around a millimeter in diameter, lacking any organs or internal structures. They have two cellular layers: the top epitheloid layer is made of ciliated "cover cells" flattened toward the outside of the organism, and the bottom layer is made up of cylinder cells that possess cilia used in locomotion, and gland cells that lack cilia.UC Berkeley: Introduction to Placozoa  Between these layers is the fiber syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers.
Trichoplax feed by absorbing food particles—mainly microbes—with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though Trichoplax has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 predicted protein-coding genes are identifiably similar to known genes in other animals.

[[Rocketdyne J-2]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrogen rocket engines, Rocketdyne engines, North American Aviation, Apollo program hardware

The J-2 was a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine used on NASA's Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles. Built in the United States of America by Rocketdyne, the J-2 burned cryogenic liquid hydrogen & liquid oxygen propellants, with each engine producing [tpl]Convert|1033.1|kN|sigfig=5|abbr=on[/tpl] of thrust in vacuum. The engine's preliminary design dates back to recommendations of the 1959 Silverstein Committee. Rocketdyne won approval to develop the J-2 in June 1960 and the first flight, AS-201, occurred on 26 February 1966. The J-2 underwent several minor upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine's performance, with two major upgrade programs, the de Laval nozzle-type J-2S and aerospike-type J-2T, being cancelled after the conclusion of the Apollo program.
The engine produced a specific impulse (Isp) of [tpl]convert|421|isp[/tpl] in a vacuum (or [tpl]convert|200|isp[/tpl] at sea level) and had a mass of approximately [tpl]Convert|3942|lb|disp=flip[/tpl]. Five J-2 engines were used on the Saturn V's S-II second stage, and one J-2 was used on the S-IVB upper stage used on both the Saturn IB and Saturn V. Proposals also existed to use various numbers of J-2 engines in the upper stages of an even larger rocket, the planned Nova. The J-2 was America's largest production liquid hydrogen fuelled rocket engine before the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine, and a modernized version of the engine, the J-2X, is intended for use on the Earth Departure Stage of NASA's Space Shuttle replacement, the Space Launch System.
Unlike most liquid-fuelled rocket engines in service at the time, the J-2 was designed to be restarted once after shutdown when flown on the Saturn V S-IVB third stage. The first burn, lasting about two minutes, placed the Apollo spacecraft into a low Earth parking orbit. After the crew verified that the spacecraft was operating nominally, the J-2 was re-ignited for translunar injection, a 6.5 minute burn which accelerated the vehicle to a course for the Moon.

Cannonball (Samuel Zachary Guthrie) is a fictional Marvel Comics superhero, associated with the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, Cannonball first appeared in Marvel Graphic Novel #4: The New Mutants (1982).
Cannonball is a mutant who uses the ability to fly at jet speeds while encased in an impenetrable force field.  The eldest of a large Kentucky coal mining family, Cannonball is one of few X-Men from a southern, rural background and has maintained the values of civility, hard work, and a strong commitment to his beliefs throughout his career as a superhero.  Several of his siblings are also mutants and have joined X-Men-related teams, including his sisters, Paige and Melody, and brothers Jay and Jeb.  Other siblings include a brother named Lewis, and four more sisters: Joelle, Elizabeth, Cissie and another unnamed sister.
Cannonball was a founding member of the X-Men's junior team The New Mutants.  He joined The New Mutants' later incarnation X-Force, serving as second-in-command and field leader.  He joined the X-Men, becoming the first member of a secondary team to "graduate".  His tenure was complicated by clashes with superiors and he eventually rejoined X-Force and later the X-Men once more.
A "salt-of-the-earth", honest, well-mannered and responsible young man, Guthrie is a natural leader.  Guthrie is a fan of science fiction, especially the works of Robert A. Heinlein.

The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is a freeway in the U.S. states of Indiana and Michigan, serving as a bypass route around Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South Bend in Indiana and Niles in Michigan. The freeway runs to the south and west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and consists of segments of U.S. Route 31 (US 31) and US 20; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area. It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley.
The freeway was first built in Indiana in the 1960s, although plans in Michigan date back to the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003. Further plans, if completed, would extend the freeway from the current end to the north. The ultimate end will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway.

Barrow Association Football Club is an English association football club based in the town of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The club participates in the Conference North, the sixth tier of the English league system. They were relegated (22nd place with 46 points) from the Conference National at the end of the 2012–13 season. Barrow play their home games at Holker Street, (currently sponsored as the "Furness Building Society Stadium"), close to the town centre and approximately 0.5 km from Barrow Railway Station.
The club spent over fifty years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972,  achieving promotion to Division 3 by finishing 3rd in the Football League Fourth Division in the 1966–67 season. The highest league period in the club's history was to be short-lived and a return to Division 4 came after relegation in 1969–70 season. Fortunes never improved and at the end of the 1971–72 season, after an unsuccessful bid for re-election, Barrow were voted out of the Football League, to be replaced by Hereford United of the Southern League. Barrow have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football and have twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the FA Trophy – in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to have won the Trophy at both old and new Wembley Stadium.
The club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname "The Bluebirds". Attendances at the club's Holker Street ground vary – the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea City in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954 – but during the 1990s and 2000s the average remained consistently between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 918http://stats.football365.com/dom/ENG/FC/attend.html during the 2012–13 season.
The club won their second FA Trophy title on 8 May 2010 after beating Stevenage Borough 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium.

[[X-Force]]

X-Force is a fictional Marvel Comics superhero team, one of several spin-offs of the popular X-Men franchise, and the eponymous subject of the X-Force comic book series. Conceived by writer/illustrator Rob Liefeld, the team was formed in New Mutants, vol. 1 #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series.
The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the New Mutants. Led by the mutant Cable, X-Force was a more militant and aggressive group compared to the X-Men. The X-Force series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success.
Low sales on the X-Force series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. X-Force, vol. 1 was canceled with #129 and relaunched as X-Statix, which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After X-Statix was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 miniseries plotted and drawn by Liefeld.
In 2007–2008, during the Messiah Complex crossover, a new version of the X-Force team was formed with Wolverine leading a more militaristic black-ops branch of the X-Men.  This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, plus Clayton Crain as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the Second Coming storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as Uncanny X-Force with Rick Remender and Jerome Opeña as the creative team and Wolverine, Psylocke, Deadpool, Archangel, Fantomex, and E.V.A. as the initial roster.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a243865/marvel-reveals-uncanny-x-force-team.html |title=Comics - News - Marvel reveals 'Uncanny X-Force' team |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-11[/tpl]
The Uncanny X-Force series ended at issue #35 in 2012 was once again relaunched as Uncanny X-Force vol. 2 as part of Marvel NOW!, with a new team led by Storm and Psylocke written by Sam Humphries.  A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, Cable and X-Force, was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold.  The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled "Vendetta".  A new X-Force (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black-ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and Marrow, written by X-Men: Legacy writer Simon Spurrier.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48983 |title=Spurrier, Kim's Adjectiveless "X-Force" Launches in February |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-12[/tpl]

Matford was a car and truck manufacturer in France from 1934 to 1940.
In the early 1930s, the Ford Motor Company was quickly expanding its European production, while Mathis had financial problems, but also a large factory at Strasbourg (which, following frontier changes formalized in 1919, was now in France).  
Ford were keen to increase production and the Mathis plant in Strasbourg seemed more suitable than their existing workshop in  Asnières-sur-Seine. A joint venture between Ford and Mathis was created under the name of Matford S.A., formally created on 1 October 1934, and owned by Ford and Matthis in the proportion 60:40.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1934 (salon 1933)| volume = Nr. 22| pages = pages 41|year = 2002|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl] The initial cars were locally assembled versions of contemporary American and British Ford models. 
The intention had been expressed to produce the Matford models alongside those from Mathis but the last Mathis was actually made in October 1934,[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1940 - 46 (les années sans salon)| volume = Nr. 26| pages = Page 37|year = 2003|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl]   which was also the month in which Matford was formally founded.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1937 (salon Oct 1936)| volume = Nr. 3| pages = Page 55|year = 1997|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl]    During 1935, under the energetic direction of Maurice Dollfus who had joined Ford in 1930, Ford poured massive amounts of capital into modernising the Strasbourg plant.  There were high hopes for the Matford collaboration which, in 1934, was expected to last for fifty years. 
In 1935 a range of V-8 engined Matfords was put on the market which were very similar to the American Ford Model 48s with their V-8 3622cc engines. A French version appeared in 1936 as the model that has come to be known as the Matford Alsace, with a choice of a 2,225 or 3,621 cc V-8 engine:  a cabriolet was also listed. The 1937 models were generally known at the time simply as the Matford 13CV and the Matford 21CV which followed the convention of the time by using the cars' fiscal horse power ratings as model names.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = René Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures françaises 1938 (salon 1937)| volume = Nr. 6| pages = Page 55|year = 1998|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris [/tpl]     Both featured a V-shaped windscreen and in 1938 a US style timber bodied estate car joined the range.   The steel car bodies were purchased from the coachbuilders Chausson rather than being built inhouse.
Volume passenger car production ended in 1940 with the build up of truck orders for the French army, though an unknown number were made during the German occupation, at least till 1942. Under the occupation, because of its proximity to the German border, the contents of the Matford Stasbourg factory were moved to Ford's Cologne plant, while a new Ford plant opened at Poissy near Paris in 1940. 
Ford links with Mathis were severed.   Ford's French business was restructured in 1940, now taking the name Ford Société Anonyme Française and this company used the Ford trademark.  Émile Mathis, fearing persecution under German occupation, escaped to the USA where he spent the war, while Matford ceased to exist.
Matford cars achieved success at the Coupe de Dames (1936) and at Monte Carlo (1938).

Osnaburg was a coarse type of plain textile fabric, named for the city of Osnabrück (from which it may have been first imported into English-speaking countries). Originally made from flax yarns, it has been made from either flax, tow or jute yarns, sometimes flax or tow warp with mixed or jute weft, and often entirely of jute. The finer and better qualities form a kind of common sheeting, and the various kinds may contain from 20 to 36 threads per inch and 10 to 15 picks per inch.[tpl]EB1911|wstitle=Osnaburg[/tpl]
It began to be woven in Scotland as an imitation from a German import of a coarse lint or tow-based linen cloth in the later 1730s. It quickly became the most important variety in East-Central Scotland. Sales quadrupled, from 0.5 million yards in 1747 to 2.2 million yards in 1758. It was exported mainly to England, the Netherlands and Britain's colonies in America, and some rough fabrics were called "osnaburg" as late as the mid-twentieth century.  In the Atlantic plantation complex, prior to the abolition of slavery, osnaburg was the fabric most often used for slave garments.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

[tpl]unicode|ǀXam[/tpl] (/Kham) [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑː|m[/tpl], or [tpl]unicode|ǀXam Kaǃkʼe[/tpl], is an extinct Khoisan language of South Africa, part of the ǃkwi language group. It is closely related to the Nǁng language, which still has a few speakers.
ǀXam words were used for the South African motto adopted on 27 April 2000,
which is supposed to mean diverse people unite or, on a collective scale, Unity in Diversity. However, it is not known if that phrase would have been idiomatic in ǀXam.  ǀXam is not one of the eleven official languages of South Africa because it is extinct and has no more speakers (mother or second tongue).
The pipe at the beginning of the name "ǀXam" represents a dental click, like the English interjection tsk, tsk! used to express pity or shame. The [tpl]angbr|x[/tpl] represents the ch sound of Scottish Gaelic loch, Russian khikhikat, German Bach, or Hebrew Chanukkah.  There is little variation in rendering the name, compared to other Khoisan languages.  Besides the simple orthographic variant [tpl]Unicode|ǀKham[/tpl], there is a different grammatical form, [tpl]Unicode|ǀKhuai[/tpl]
Much of the scholarly work on the ǀXam language was performed by Wilhelm Bleek, a German linguist of the 19th century.  He had studied a variety of ǀXam spoken at Achterveld, and (with Lucy Lloyd) another spoken at Strandberg and Katkop.Güldemann (2011)

Oregon Caves National Monument is a National Monument in the northern Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The main part of the [tpl]convert|488|acres|ha|adj=on[/tpl] park, including the marble cave and a visitor center, is located [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] east of Cave Junction, on Oregon Route 46. A separate visitor center in Cave Junction occupies [tpl]convert|4|acre|ha[/tpl] of the total. Both parts of the monument, managed by the National Park Service, are in southwestern Josephine County, near the Oregon–California border. The climate is generally mild even at the cave's elevation of about [tpl]convert|4000|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level, but icicles can form at the cave entrance, and winter snow sometimes blocks the park highway.
Elijah Davidson, a resident of nearby Williams, discovered the cave in 1874. Over the next two decades, private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at the publicly owned site. After passage of the Antiquities Act by the United States Congress, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the United States Forest Service, in 1909. The popularity of the automobile, construction of paved highways, and promotion of tourism by boosters from Grants Pass led to large increases in cave visitation during the late 1920s and thereafter. Among the attractions at the remote monument is the Oregon Caves Chateau, a six-story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934. It is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the Oregon Caves Historic District within the monument. The Park Service, which assumed control of the monument in 1933, offers tours of the cave from mid-April through early November.  
Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with passages totaling about [tpl]convert|15000|ft|m[/tpl], that formed in marble. The parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes that created the Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190 million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.
In addition to cave touring, activities at the park include hiking, photography, and wildlife viewing. One of the park trails leads through the forest to Big Tree, which at [tpl]convert|13|ft|m[/tpl] is the thickest Douglas-fir known in Oregon. Lodging and food are available at The Chateau and in Cave Junction. Camping is available at Forest Service campgrounds and private sites in the area.

[[A Time for Choosing]]

CATEGORIES: Speeches by Ronald Reagan, United States presidential election, 1964

A Time for Choosing, also known as The Speech, was a speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater.
Many versions of the speech exist, since it was altered over many weeks.  Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for Barry Goldwater.  Richard Nixon gave that nomination speech.  Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use "A Time for Choosing" until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny.  In his autobiography Reagan recalled going to bed that night "hoping I hadn't let Barry down."[tpl]cite book |last=Regan |first=Ronald |author-link=Ronald Reagan |year=1990 |title=An American Life: The Autobiography |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0671691988 |location=New York City |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=143 |isbn=0671691988 |accessdate=31 March 2014 |quote=When it was over, the others in the room said I had done well. But I was still nervous about it and, when I went to bed, I was hoping I hadn't let Barry down[/tpl]
Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In this speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: "The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/40_reagan/psources/ps_choose64.html |title=A Time for Choosing |publisher=PBS |accessdate=April 17, 2007[/tpl] He also said, "You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism."Richard A. Harris, Daniel J. Tichenor. A History of the U.S. Political System: Ideas, Interests, and Institutions, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2009. Pp. 384.

Soon afterwards, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California. To this day, this speech is considered one of the most effective ever made on behalf of a candidate. Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Reagan was later called the "Great Communicator" in recognition of his effective speech-making skills.

On the evening of September 8, 1923, seven destroyers, while traveling at 20 knots (37 km/h), ran aground at Honda Point, a few miles from the northern side of the Santa Barbara Channel off Point Arguello on the  coast in Santa Barbara County, California. Two other ships grounded, but were able to maneuver free of the rocks.  Twenty-three sailors died in the disaster.

Exidy was one of the largest creators of arcade video games during the early period of video games, from 1974 until at least 1986 (when Chiller was released http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7328). The company was founded by H.R. "Pete" Kauffman. The name "Exidy" was a portmanteau of the words "Excellence in Dynamics."
Some of the notable games released by Exidy included Circus, Death Race, Star Fire, Venture, Pepper II,  Mouse Trap, Victory, Targ, and Spectar. Star Fire appeared in the 1980 film Midnight Madness, while Mouse Trap was the subject of a song on the 1982 Pac-Man Fever album. Also produced but never given as wide a release was the ultra rare puzzle game Hard Hat, the completed but unreleased Kreeper Krawlers, and the prototype of rather mysterious origins Teeter Torture.

[[Leg cutter]]
CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

A leg cutter is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.
A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side. 
What differentiates a genuine leg cutter from a seam-up delivery that simply moves away off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled.
Leg cutters do not turn as sharply as leg breaks bowled by a leg spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can edge the ball off the outside edge of his bat, offering a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders.
A fast bowler will typically use the leg cutter as a variation ball as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. The leg cutter action can also produce a significantly slower ball with little obvious change in the bowler's arm speed, making the delivery doubly deceptive. On the other hand, the lack of pace of the delivery may be disadvantageous. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell described Jeff Thomson's leg cutter thus: "He had this leg cutter, and you were usually pretty happy to see it, because it meant that the ball wasn't coming at your head at 95 miles an hour."
The most prominent users of leg cutter include Alec Bedser, Fazal Mahmood and of late Terry Alderman, Carl Rackemann and Venkatesh Prasad. 
Leg cutters are much more frequently seen in indoor cricket as the physical arena in which the game is played limits the pace at which bowlers can bowl, and hence they must use other techniques to prevent the batsmen from scoring.

[[Off cutter]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket deliveries, Cricket terminology

An off cutter is a type of delivery in the game of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.
A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For an off cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the right side of the ball (from his viewpoint), in an action similar to bowling an off break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like an off break, which makes the ball deviate to the right when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the left, or from the off side towards the leg side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called an off cutter because it moves away from the off side. What differentiates a genuine off cutter from a delivery that simply nips back off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled.
Off cutters do not turn as sharply as off breaks bowled by an off spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can miss the ball with his bat and be bowled between bat and pad or out leg before wicket if struck on the pads.
A fast bowler will typically use the off cutter as a variation ball, as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. Waqar Younis, Glenn McGrath, Richard Hadlee, and Fred Trueman managed a bagful of wickets with this delivery because of the accurate lengths at which they operated, between fullish and good lengths (ball landing 2 to 3 steps in front of the batsman) at close to the off stump line. The surprise comes because, when facing rigorously accurate off-side bowlers, like those mentioned above,  batters usually incorporate plans to leave the ball, or exaggerate foot movements to the pitch of the ball in anticipation.
The calling card of this delivery, for the batsman to read it in advance, is the typical wobble in the seam after ball release with the seam slanting predominantly towards the batsman. A simple way for a beginner to learn to bowl cutters is to try imparting strong back-spin to the ball by pulling down on the seam at the time of release while keeping the seam vertical. 
Cutters work especially well on pitches that are rough (or when the ball lands on  cracks on the surface). Such surfaces grip the seam and stop the reverse rotation, leading to considerable deviation as well as the effect of ball keeping low after pitching. In the latter case, the balls are also called 'shooters'. Lance Klusener used this tactic in matches in the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in one match in Calcutta towards the end of his career when he had lost some of his speed. 
In test matches, bowlers tend to 'work the cracks' using cutters, meaning that they try pitching the ball on cracks repeatedly with the result that few of the balls that do pitch on cracks unsettles even a well-set batsman.
In contemporary cricket, the off-cutter is primarily used as a slower ball in limited over cricket.

[[European Monetary System]]

CATEGORIES: Europe, Eurozone fiscal matters, International economics, Money

European Monetary System (EMS) was an arrangement established in 1979 under the Jenkins European Commission where most nations of the European Economic Community (EEC) linked their currencies to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another. 
After the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, most of the EEC countries agreed in 1972 to maintain stable exchange rates by preventing exchange rate fluctuations of more than 2.25% (the European "currency snake"). In March 1979, this system was replaced by the European Monetary System, and the European Currency Unit (ECU) was defined.
The basic elements of the arrangement were:
Although no currency was designated as an anchor, the Deutsche Mark and German Bundesbank soon emerged as the centre of the EMS. Because of its relative strength, and the low-inflation policies of the bank, all other currencies were forced to follow its lead if they wanted to stay inside the system. Eventually, this situation led to dissatisfaction in most countries, and was one of the primary forces behind the drive to a monetary union (ultimately the euro).
Periodic adjustments raised the values of strong currencies and lowered those of weaker ones, but after 1986 changes in national interest rates were used to keep the currencies within a narrow range. In the early 1990s the European Monetary System was strained by the differing economic policies and conditions of its members, especially the newly reunified Germany, and Britain (which had initially declined to join and only did so in 1990) permanently withdrew from the system in September 1992. Speculative attacks on the French Franc during the following year led to the so-called Brussels Compromise in August 1993 which established a new fluctuation band of +15%.

The [tpl]nihongo|FM Towns|エフエムタウンズ|Efu Emu Taunzu[/tpl] system is a Japanese PC variant, built by Fujitsu from February 1989 to the summer of 1997. It started as a proprietary PC variant intended for multimedia applications and PC games, but later became more compatible with regular PCs. In 1993, the FM Towns Marty was released, a gaming console compatible with existing FM Towns games.
The "FM" part of the name means "Fujitsu Micro" like their earlier products, while the "Towns" part is derived from the code name the system was assigned while in development, "Townes". This refers to Charles Townes, one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics, following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to code name PC products after Nobel Prize winners. The e in "Townes" was dropped when the system went into production to make it clearer that the term was to be pronounced like the word "towns" rather than the potential "tow-nes".http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=968

[[Dreams Die Hard]]
CATEGORIES: 1982 books, Political autobiographies

 ''Dreams Die Hard''  is an autobiographical book written in 1982 by David Harris, a prominent anti-Vietnam War activist during the 1960s.
The book chronicles the experiences of three men (Harris, Allard Lowenstein, and Dennis Sweeney) amid the political and social tumult of the 1960s, as well as the aftermath of these experiences. Specifically, paranoid schizophrenia and two decades of accumulated disillusionment and homophobia eventually lead a deranged Sweeney to murder Lowenstein.
One-term Congressman Lowenstein, "the world's oldest student activist," had, by his forties, lived decades in various political arenas. From the Mississippi Freedom Summer project in the Deep South, to the Dump Johnson campaign of 1968, Allard was passionate and well-connected in liberal circles. He was most likely bisexual before the word was current.[tpl]Fact|date=May 2008[/tpl],
Harris's detailed and historical narration, written in an attempt to explain the lives of each of the characters, discusses how the three activists began their affiliations at Stanford University, and continued through the turbulent decade.
Lowenstein's sexual orientation reappears throughout the book and serves as one of many connections between the three main figures: both Harris and Sweeney rejected overt passes from Lowenstein; Harris's reaction was thoughtful, empathetic, and verbal; but Sweeney's reaction was decidedly irrational and physical and ended in murder.

[[Organic composition of capital]]
CATEGORIES: Marxist theory, Political economy

The organic composition of capital (OCC) is a concept created by Karl Marx in his critique of political economy and used in Marxian economics as a theoretical alternative to neo-classical concepts of factors of production, production functions, capital productivity and capital-output ratios. It is normally defined as the ratio of constant capital (capital invested in plant, equipment and materials) to variable capital (capital invested in the labour-costs involved in hiring employees). The concept does not apply to all capital assets, only to capital invested in production (i.e. production capital). The neoclassical concept synonymous to increasing organic composition of capital is capital deepening.
Marx first referred to the idea in 1847 http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/12/31.htm
and discussed it in detail in Capital Vol. 1, chapter 25 ("The General law of Capitalist Accumulation"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm). In Capital Vol. 3 Marx demonstrates that the organic composition of capital decisively influences industrial profitability.
According to Marx, the OCC expresses the specific form which the capitalist mode of production gives to the relationship between means of production and labor power, determining the productivity of labor and the creation of a surplus product. This relationship has both technical and social aspects, reflecting the fact that simultaneously consumable use values and commercial exchange-values are being produced.
Marx calls this capital composition "organic", because it refers to the relationship between "living" and "dead" (or inert) elements in a capital investment. The "living element" is employed labour actively at work. The "dead" parts are the tools, materials and equipment worked with, which are the results of past labour.
Marx argues that a rising organic composition of capital is a necessary effect of capital accumulation and competition in the sphere of production, at least in the long term. This means that the share of constant capital in the total capital outlay increases, and that labor input per product unit declines.

Grandtully rapids on the River Tay is a site for canoeing and rafting in Scotland.
Grandtully rapids is made of a top fall, the island (a large rock in the middle of the rapids where many canoeists not used to rapids often break their boats), and the bottom fall.
There is a nearby campsite, a converted train goods yard, owned by the Scottish Canoe Association.  The forestry commission have an access point a few miles upstream giving a good entry for Whitewater Racing.  The banks of the river at the rapid site were owned by Lyle Estates (of Tate and Lyle) and are now owned by a former employee of that company who allows slalom gates to be kept permanently.  
The new Jack Cuthill Building on the campsite, built in 2003, offers toilets, changing rooms, showers and a meeting room.

The Forth Canoe Club, founded in 1934, is Scotland's oldest surviving canoe club.  It is a founding member of the Scottish Canoe Association.
The club originally met at Granton in North Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth. In 1982 it moved to Lochrin Basin at the Edinburgh end of the Union Canal following an extensive dredging operation by the club's second and current commodore Kelso Riddell.
When the Union Canal was developed by British Waterways as part of the Millennium Link, Forth Canoe Club lost its buildings there and moved to the Old St Andrew's Boathouse further along the canal in 2004.
The first commodore was Jack Cuthill and the main building of the Club was named after him. When this building was destroyed, the new building at Grandtully was named in his memory.
The club's motto, [tpl]lang|la|per ventus et per artus[/tpl] means "by wind and by skill".
Forth Canoe Club member David Florence represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member of the senior team.  At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he won a silver medal in the men's C1 single slalom event on 12 August 2008.

Huánuco has a rough topography comprising parts of the Sierra and the High Jungle (mountain rim) regions. Being equidistant from the north and the south of the country, it has the privilege of having a mild weather with an average annual temperature of 20°C (68°F).
This region is important for its geographical location, history, and for the richness of its land, where the presence of man goes back to ancient times. El Hombre de Lauricocha (Man of Lauricocha) is among the most distinctive examples, dating from 10,000 BC, as well as Kotosh, where vestiges of the oldest settlement in the Americas (4200 BC) took place.
Several ethnic groups inhabited this region. However, after a severe resistance, they started to incorporate as part of the Inca empire. Huánuco then became part of the Cusco-Cajamarca-Cusco route.
In the beginning of the 19th century, during the emancipation process, Huánuco was one of the first cities to promote Peru's independence. Moreover, a first oath took place in this city on December 15, 1820, after several uprisings in Huamalíes, Huallanca and Ambo.

The Union Canal is a canal in Scotland, running from Falkirk to Edinburgh, constructed to bring minerals, especially coal, to the capital. It was opened in 1822 and was initially successful, but the construction of railways, particularly the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, opened in 1842, diminished its value as a transport medium. It fell into slow commercial decline and became disused in the 1930s.
It shares in the revival of interest in canals generally at the present day, and received a boost when the Millennium Link was completed in 2000, reconnecting it to the Forth and Clyde Canal. It is now in popular use for leisure purposes.

[[Noctis]]
CATEGORIES: 1996 video games, Space flight simulator games, Windows games, Vaporware, DOS games

Noctis (Latin for "of night") is a computer space flight simulator featuring first-person visual exploration of an imaginary galaxy.
The player is manifested in Noctis as a physical intelligent being in charge of a fantastic spacecraft called a Stardrifter, capable of instantaneous interstellar travel. This allows travelling between stars, refuelling the Stardrifter from Lithium ion-ejecting stars, approaching planets in star systems and their moons, and even landing where it is physically possible. Many planets feature atmospheres and weather effects. Some harbour plants and animals, or even mysterious ruins. No goal or measure of success is imposed by the game: it simply allows to catalogue and annotate the player's discoveries in a common database of stellar bodies called the GUIDE, which is to be synchronised over the author's Internet server. The player can explore the Stardrifter and even walk on its roof.
In the game's sci-fi setting, a fleet of Stardrifters was left behind by a race of sentient cats known as Felysians who abandoned their home world (planet Felysia, star system Balastrackonastreya) long ago for unknown reasons. The Felysians were the only sentient beings in the Noctis galaxy, so there are none to find in the Noctis game.

The writers first added these aspects in 1994, while revealing Todd as the illegitimate son of Victor Lord and Irene Manning, making him the brother of their first child together, Tina Lord, and half-brother to Victor's elder heiress daughter and original One Life to Live heroine Victoria Lord.
The character's love life has also been carefully considered by the series. He marries longtime love Blair Cramer multiple times throughout the years and their union produces two living children, Starr and Jack. In 2009, he is informed that he has a second daughter, Danielle, conceived with his former wife and love Téa Delgado during a previous reunion.

CATEGORIES: Curves, Algebraic curves

In geometry, an epicycloid is a plane curve produced by tracing the path of a chosen point of a circle — called an epicycle — which rolls without slipping around a fixed circle. It is a particular kind of roulette.
If the smaller circle has radius r, and the larger circle has radius R = kr, then the
parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:
or:
If k is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has k cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not
differentiable).
If k is a rational number, say k=p/q expressed in simplest terms, then the curve has p cusps.
If k is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and forms a dense subset of the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius R + 2r.

Mikhail came to power at a time when Abkhazia had only recently been declared a protectorate of Russia, as a result of the 1810 manifesto of Tsar Alexander I. During the Crimean War of 1853-55, Abkhazia was invaded by Turkey, and Mikhail was forced to declare his loyalty to Turkey. This came back to haunt him when, in 1864, the Russians accused him of cooperating with Turkey during the war. He was subsequently exiled to Voronezh, in Russia - an act which was vastly unpopular with the Abkhaz people.
Mikhail's deportation, and death not long after, also marked the beginning of the end for Abkhazian self-governance for the next 140 years. In June 1864, the Princedom was abolished and replaced by the Sukhumi Military Sector. In 1866, a popular uprising declared Mikhail's son Giorgi Prince, but this was short-lived.

The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitalia, testicular volume and development of pubic and axillary hair. This scale was first identified by James Tanner, a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.[tpl]WhoNamedIt|synd|3082[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Ciudad Bolívar ([tpl]IPA-es|sjuˈðað βoˈliβar[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-en|Bolivar City[/tpl]) is the capital of Venezuela's southeastern Bolívar State. It was founded as Angostura in 1764 and renamed in 1846. The town's original name of Angostura was a contraction of its full descriptive name, Santo Tomé de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco (Saint Thomas of Guiana of the narrows of the Orinoco). The town also gave its name to the Angostura tree (Cusparia febrifuga) which grows in the area. Angostura bitters were invented there in 1824, though the company which produced them later moved to Trinidad and Tobago.[tpl]cite book |last=Loeb |first=Katie M. |title=Shake, Stir, Pour: Fresh Homegrown Cocktails |year=2012 |publisher=Quarry Books |location=Beverly, MA |isbn=9781592537976 |oclc=806490659 |page=146[/tpl] 
Ciudad Bolívar has a well-preserved historic center; a cathedral and other original colonial buildings surround the Plaza Bolívar.

Lemon & Paeroa, also known as L&P, is a sweet soft drink manufactured in New Zealand. Traditionally made by combining lemon juice with carbonated mineral water from the town of Paeroa, it is now manufactured by multi-national Coca-Cola.
Lemon & Paeroa can be found in New Zealand, in specialty New Zealand stores abroad and in the Gourmet Burger Kitchen[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gbk.co.uk/menu/drinks/ | title = Gourmet Burger Kitchen | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Gourmet Burger Kitchen Drinks Menu[/tpl] chain of restaurants within the UK, and now at Coles supermarkets in Australia.http://shop.coles.com.au/online/national/l-p-soft-drinks-lemon-paeroa The comically pretentious advertising slogan "World famous in New Zealand" has become a popular New Zealand saying; it is used to describe items that though famous within New Zealand are unknown in the rest of the world, whereas similar items and people in larger countries would have a far higher media profile and would therefore be famous worldwide.
Over the years attempts have been made to market variations, such as L&P dry.  In 2005 "Sweet As L&P" with artificial sweetener aspartame was introduced with the modified slogan "World Famous in New Zealand since quite recently", the traditional product now being advertised as "World Famous in New Zealand since AGES ago".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=20954 | title = L&P Stubbies Advert | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | date = 2005-02-26 | publisher = Visit4 Limited | location = London W5 2ZS, United Kingdom | quote = World famous in New Zealand since ages ago.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSFCvG6curE | title = L & P Stubbies Ad (NZ) | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | publisher = YouTube | location = San Bruno, CA 94066, United States | quote = World famous in New Zealand since ages ago.[/tpl]
L&P is also often used as a mixer in New Zealand bars, particularly with Southern Comfort.
Although L&P itself is now made on the same production line as Coke's other beverages, an L&P Kiwiana shop and café remains in Paeroa.
Analysis of Paeroa mineral water by Arthur Wohlman in 1904 revealed magnesium bicarbonate in a concentration of 73 grains to the gallon (1040 mg/L). In 1908 the property containing the mineral spring was purchased by Robert Fewell and his brother-in-law Frank Brinkler.[ref]
</ref> Their company Paeroa Natural Mineral Water Company, bottled the spring water until 1915 when they sold the company to Menzies and Company who, in turn, opened a new factory in Paeroa in 1926. In the late 1940s 'Lemon and Paeroa' and 'Paeroa and Lemon' were both marketed. In 1963 Menzies and Co merged with Hamilton based bottlers CL Innes, and L&P took on the ''Innes [[Tartan]]'' as a motif on the neck of the L&P bottle. This continued until the late 1970s, when L&P was taken over by Oasis Industries, before it was, in turn, taken over by Coca Cola.<ref name = McCloy>

In the late 1980s, a collaboration of New Zealand music artists recorded a cover of Martha and the Vandellas song (Love is Like A) Heat Wave, to promote the drink.

Memory augmentation is the process by which one's ability to retain information is increased. The retrieval of memory has been proven to be faulty in the human brain—it is partially inaccurate and not totally reliable (see more: Recovered memory.) A study conducted by students of the Information Science Department in Nara, Japan sought to measure how able memory is to augment. They used a computer system, the "Ubiquitous Memories," to demonstrate if the technology aided to augmentation better than other methods: notes with a pen and paper, portraits used in a previous trial experiment, and just plain human memory. The results were that the Ubiquitous Memories aided in retrieving memory, and made less mistakes than the other methods.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Tatsuyuki|coauthors=Tomohiro Fukuhara, Hideaki Takeda, Yasuyuki Kono, Masatsugu Kidode|title=Ubiquitous Memories: a memory externalization system using physical objects|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|date=15 August 2006|volume= 11|series=Series 4|pages=287–298[/tpl]

The Kübler-Ross model, or the five stages of grief, is a series of emotional stages experienced when faced with impending death or death of someone. The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining,  depression and acceptance. 
The model was first introduced by Swiss-American Psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book, On Death and Dying, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom[/tpl] Motivated by the lack of curriculum in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross began a project which examined death and those faced with it while working as an instructor at the University of Chicago's medical school. Kübler-Ross' project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research became the foundation for her book, and revolutionized how the U.S. medical field takes care of the terminally ill. In the decades since the publication of "On Death and Dying", the Kübler-Ross concept has become largely accepted by the general public; however, its validity has yet to be consistently supported by the majority of research studies that have examined it[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl].
Elisabeth Kübler-Ross noted that the stages are not meant to be a complete list of all possible emotions that could be felt, and they can occur in any order. Her hypothesis holds that not everyone who experiences a life-threatening or life-altering event feels all five of the responses, due to  reactions of personal losses differing between people.

[[Wireless mesh network]]
CATEGORIES: Wireless networking, Open problems, Radio technology

A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. The mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones and other wireless devices while the mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways which may, but need not, connect to the Internet. The coverage area of the radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud is dependent on the radio nodes working in harmony with each other to create a radio network. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. The animation below illustrates how wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks can be implemented with various wireless technology including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, cellular technologies or combinations of  more than one type.

Waimea Canyon, also known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a large canyon, approximately ten miles (16 km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western side of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States. Waimea is Hawaiian for "reddish water", a reference to the erosion of the canyon's red soil.Pukui, Mary Kawena. Place Names of Hawaii. University of Hawaii Press. ISBN 0-8248-0524-0.  The canyon was formed by a deep incision of the Waimea River arising from the extreme rainfall on the island's central peak, Mount Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale, among the wettest places on earth.
Geologically the canyon is carved into the tholeiitic and post-shield calc-alkaline lavas of the canyon basalt. The lavas of the canyon provide evidence for massive faulting and collapse in the early history of the island. The west side of the canyon is all thin, west-dipping lavas of the Napali Member, while the east side is very thick, flat-lying lavas of the Olokele and Makaweli Members. The two sides are separated by an enormous fault along which a large part of the island moved downwards in a big collapse.
The canyon has a unique geologic history—it was formed not only by the steady process of erosion, but also by a catastrophic collapse of the volcano that created Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.
Like the other Hawaiian islands, Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i is the top of an enormous volcano rising from the ocean floor. With lava flows dated to about 5 million years ago, Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i is the oldest of the large Hawaiian islands. Roughly 4 million years ago, while Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i was still erupting almost continuously, a portion of the island collapsed. This collapse formed a depression, which then filled with lava flows.
In the time since, rainwater from the slopes of Mount Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale[tpl]okina[/tpl]ale have eroded Waimea Canyon along one edge of the collapse. The cliffs on the west side of the canyon are composed of thin lava flows that ran down the surface of the Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i volcano. On the other side of the canyon, the cliff walls are built from thick lava flows that pooled in the depression. Over time, the exposed basalt has weathered from its original black to bright red.
Waimea Canyon State Park encompasses 1,866 acres (7.5 km²) and is a popular tourist attraction on the island. It provides a wilderness area with numerous hiking trails. It can be accessed from Waimea on Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i state road 550, which is 18 miles long and leads up to Koke'e State Park.  The island of Niihau, only a short distance west of Kauai at that point, can be clearly seen from the highway.

[[Bach family]]

CATEGORIES: Bach family

The Bach family was of importance in the history of music for nearly two hundred years, with over 50 known musicians and several notable composers, the best-known of whom was Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750). A family genealogy was drawn up by Johann Sebastian Bach himself in 1735, his 50th year, and completed by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel.
The Bach family never left Thuringia until the sons of Sebastian went into a more modern world. Through all the misery of the peasantry at the period of the Thirty Years' War this clan maintained its position and produced musicians who, however local their fame, were among the greatest in Europe. So numerous and so eminent were they that in Erfurt musicians were known as "Bachs", even when there were no longer any members of the family in the town. Sebastian Bach thus inherited the artistic tradition of a united family whose circumstances had deprived them of the distractions of the century of musical fermentation which in the rest of Europe had destroyed polyphonic music.[tpl]Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bach, Johann Sebastian|volume=3|pages=124–130[/tpl]

A Storm of Swords is the third of seven planned novels in A Song of Ice and Fire, a fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin. It was first published on 8 August 2000 in the United Kingdom,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2000/Reviews/BookReview11bMillerOnMartin.html|title=Locu  Online Reviews: A Storm of Swords (August 2000)|last=Miller|first=Faren|date=November 2000|work=Locus|publisher=LocusMag.com|accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called Path of the Dragon, which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book.
At the time of its publication, A Storm of Swords was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Australia and Israel its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as Steel and Snow in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as Blood and Gold in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes.
A Storm of Swords won the 2001 Locus Award, the 2002 Geffen Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2001 Nebula Award for Best Novel. It was the first novel in the series to be nominated for the Hugo Award, one of the two most prestigious awards in science fiction and fantasy publishing, although it lost to J. K. Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2001-hugo-awards/ |title=2001 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards |date=2001-09-03 |accessdate=2011-10-13[/tpl]
Meisha Merlin Publishing, which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, was planning to release a similar version for A Storm of Swords in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of A Clash of Kings caused it to lose its publishing rights, which were picked up by Subterranean Press. This edition, illustrated by Charles Vess, was released in the summer of 2006.
A Storm of Swords is also the name of the second expansion to the board game A Game of Thrones, released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the third season of the HBO show Game of Thrones,[tpl]cite web|first=George R.

[[Pruno]]
CATEGORIES: Fermented beverages, Prison-related crime

Pruno, or prison wine, is an alcoholic beverage variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, candy, ketchup, sugar, milk, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled bread. Bread supposedly provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons and jails, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a "vomit-flavored wine-cooler",[tpl]cite web|last=Gillin |first=Eric |url=http://www.blacktable.com/gillin030901.htm |title=Make Your Own Pruno And May God Have Mercy On Your Soul |publisher=Blacktable.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl] although flavor is often not the primary objective. Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced vs the risk of discovery by the guards), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine).

The Mobile River is located in southern Alabama in the United States.  Formed out of the confluence of the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers, the approximately [tpl]convert|45|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] river drains an area of [tpl]convert|44000|sqmi[/tpl] of Alabama, with a watershed extending into Mississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee. Its drainage basin is the fourth-largest of primary stream drainage basins entirely in the United States. The river has historically provided the principal navigational access for Alabama. Since construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, it also provides an alternative route into the Ohio River watershed.
The Tombigbee and Alabama River join to form the Mobile River approximately [tpl]convert|50|mi[/tpl] northeast of Mobile, along the county line between Mobile and Baldwin counties. The combined stream flows south, in a winding course. Approximately [tpl]convert|6|mi|0[/tpl] downstream from the confluence, the channel of the river divides, with the Mobile flowing along the western channel. The Tensaw River, a bayou of the Mobile River, flows alongside to the east, separated from [tpl]convert|2|to|5|mi|0[/tpl] as they flow southward. The Mobile River flows through the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta and reaches Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico just east of downtown Mobile.

The International Basketball Association (IBA) was founded by Alexandria, Minnesota entrepreneur Thomas Anderson in 1995.  Anderson traveled the Upper Midwest searching for franchise owners for a couple of years before the league began play with five teams in the 1995-1996 season. The original owners of franchises in the league were George Daniel (Black Hills Posse-Rapid City, SD), John Korsmo, Al Gardner, and Al Hovland (Fargo Beez), Jeff McCarron (St. Cloud Rock 'n Rollers), Bill Sorenson (Dakota Wizards - Bismarck) and Earl Barish (Winnipeg Cyclones). Earl Barish of Winnipeg directed the IBA as League President and the league eventually grew to ten franchises.  The founder, Thomas Anderson was granted a franchise along with partner Curt Zimbleman in Minot, North Dakota (Magic City Snowbears)for the 1996-1997 season.  In the fall of 2001, CBA and IBL teams merged with the IBA and purchased the assets of the defunct CBA, including its name, logo and records from the bankruptcy court and restarted operations, calling itself the CBA. This group continues to operate today with the Dakota Wizards the only surviving founding member.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Pugh attended Miami University. He began practicing law in 1843, later serving as a Captain in the 4th Ohio Regiment in the Mexican-American War. After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1848 to 1850, he served as State Attorney General from 1852 to 1854. Pugh served a single term in the United States Senate from 1855 to 1861, losing a re-election bid to Salmon P. Chase, whom he had replaced.

CATEGORIES: Acknowledgements of death, Military life, Military traditions, Salutes

[tpl]Other uses|21 Guns (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]21 Guns[/tpl]
Gun salutes are the firing of cannons or firearms as a military honor.
The custom stems from naval tradition, where a warship would fire its cannons harmlessly out to sea, until all ammunition was spent, to show that it was disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. As naval customs evolved, 21 guns came to be fired for heads of state, with the number decreasing with the rank of the recipient of the honor.
While the 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized, the number of rounds fired in any given salute will vary depending on the conditions. Circumstances affecting these variations include the particular occasion and, in the case of military and state funerals, the branch of service, and rank (or office) of the person to whom honors are being rendered.

The "Subs", as they are often called, are a group of rejected applicants to the Legion of Super-Heroes who banded together, hoping to prove to the Legion that their powers were not as useless as the Legionnaires claimed.  They first appeared in Adventure Comics #306 (March 1963). They were depicted as reasonably effective superheroes until Keith Giffen, during his tenure as Legion writer, began depicting the team as something of a joke. However, the Subs regained some respect when founding member Polar Boy joined the main Legion and a new Legion of Substitute Heroes was formed.

[[Postage stamps and postal history of Obock]]

CATEGORIES: Philately by country, Obock Region

During its time as a French colony, Obock issued its own postage stamps.  At first the inhabitants used the general stamps of the French Colonies, but in 1894 they were overprinted with "OBOCK".  Later in the year some of these were also surcharged with values from 1 centime to 5 francs.  By the end of the year, a supply of the omnibus Navigation and Commerce issues became available, inscribed OBOCK in red or blue.
1893 and 1894 brought the stamps for which Obock is most famous among philatelists: a series of imperforate stamps with simulated perforations, a scalloped line resembling the outline of a perforated stamps, printed all around the design.  In addition, the 2-franc and higher denomination stamps are in the shape of a large equilateral triangle. While the low values are relatively common, the triangular stamps are more scarce.
Although with the departure of the government from Obock, it is hard to believe that much mail came or went from the little port town, used stamps are no more valuable than unused.  Authentic uses on cover are not often seen however.
In 1902 stamps issued for the whole French Somali Coast superseded the stamps of Obock.

[[Spot color]]
CATEGORIES: Color space, Printing terminology

In offset printing, a spot color is any color generated by an ink (pure or mixed) that is printed using a single run.   
The widespread offset-printing process is composed of four spot colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black) commonly referred to as CMYK. More advanced processes involve the use of six spot colors (hexachromatic process), which add Orange and Green to the process (termed CMYKOG). The two additional spot colors are added to compensate for the ineffective reproduction of faint tints using CMYK colors only. However, offset technicians around the world use the term spot color to mean any color generated by a non-standard offset ink; such as metallic, fluorescent, or custom hand-mixed inks. 
When making a multi-color print with a spot color process, every spot color needs its own lithographic film. All the areas of the same spot color are printed using the same film, hence, using the same lithographic plate.  The dot gain, hence the screen angle and line frequency, of a spot color vary according to its intended purpose. Spot lamination and UV coatings are sometimes referred to as 'spot colors', as they share the characteristics of requiring a separate lithographic film and print run.

Mount Vancouver is the eighth highest mountain in Canada and is located in Kluane National Park and Reserve on the Canada-US border. Mt. Vancouver has three summits: north, middle and south with middle being the lowest. The south summit borders Canada and the United States and is known as Good Neighbor Peak. While conventional wisdom indicates that the north summit is the highest, discrepancies in topographic maps of the area muddle the question. Older Canadian maps indicate that north is the highest but newer US maps based on GPS, show the south summit higher. However, the US maps do not show the north summit.[tpl]cite bivouac|id=237|name=Mount Vancouver|accessdate=2004-07-09[/tpl]
The mountain was named by William Healey Dall in 1874 after George Vancouver, who explored the southeast coast of Alaska from 1792 to 1794.

Mount Hubbard is one of the major mountains of the Saint Elias Range. It is located on the Alaska/Yukon border; the Canadian side is within Kluane National Park and Reserve, and the American side is part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The mountain was named in 1890 by USGS geologist Israel Russell after Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, which had co-sponsored Russell's expedition.
Hubbard is the highest point of a large massif with three named summits; the other two are Mount Alverstone and Mount Kennedy. Alverstone and Hubbard form a corner of the U.S.-Canadian border: the border extends roughly south from these peaks toward the Alaska panhandle, and roughly west toward Mount Saint Elias, approximately [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] away. The Hubbard Glacier separates Mount Hubbard from Mount Vancouver to the west, while the Lowell Glacier lies to the east of the peak.
Mount Hubbard is the eighth highest peak in the United States, and the twelfth highest peak in Canada[tpl]ref|prom[/tpl]. It is also notable for its large rise above local terrain. For example, its west face rises 7,500 feet (2,286 m) above the Alverstone Glacier in less than 2 miles (3.2 km), and the peak rises [tpl]convert|11000|ft|m|-1[/tpl] above the Hubbard Glacier to the southwest in only [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Mount Hubbard is just over [tpl]convert|20|mi|km|0|abbr=pon[/tpl] from tidewater at Disenchantment Bay. However, despite its precipitous drops to the west, the eastern side provides a nontechnical (though long) route to the summit.

CATEGORIES: Bob Marley and the Wailers albums, Island Records albums, Albums produced by Alex Sadkin, 1979 albums

Survival is a roots reggae album by Bob Marley & The Wailers released in 1979.
Survival is an album with an outwardly militant theme. Some speculate that this was due in part to criticism Marley received for the laid-back, ganja-soaked atmosphere of his previous release, "Kaya", which seemed to sidetrack the urgency of his message. In the song "Africa Unite", Marley proclaims Pan-African solidarity.  The song "Zimbabwe" is a hymn dedicated to later-independent Rhodesia. The song was performed at Zimbabwe's Independence Celebration in 1980, just after the official declaration of Zimbabwe's independence. "Zimbabwe" is seen as an unofficial national song.
Survival was originally to be called Black Survival to underscore the urgency of African unity, but the name was shortened to prevent misinterpretations of the album's theme.  Marley originally planned to release Survival as the first part of a trilogy, followed by Uprising in 1980 and Confrontation in 1983.
In South Africa the album was partly censored by the then white apartheid government.Tribute to Bob Marley The Daily Star.

[[Political argument]]

CATEGORIES: Arguments, Politics

thumb|Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at Columbia University in 2007.A political argument is an instance of a logical argument applied to politics. Political arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously fallacious.
A classic example of political arguments are those contained in The Federalist Papers arguing in favor of ratification of the American constitution.

[[3RRR]]

CATEGORIES: Community radio stations in Australia, Radio stations in Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Radio stations established in 1976

3RRR (pronounced "Three Triple R", or simply "Triple R") is a popular Australian community radio station, based in Melbourne.
3RRR first commenced broadcasting in 1976 from the studios of 3ST, the student radio station of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (now RMIT University), on an educational licence with the name 3RMT. In 1979 it relocated to Fitzroy, and adopted its present name. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became synonymous with the post punk and new wave subcultures. It has developed a devoted base of listeners, many of whom donate their time or money to keep the station going; either as volunteers or through the annual "Radiothon". In late 2004, supporters raised enough money for the station to purchase and move into new premises on the corner of Blyth and Nicholson Streets in Brunswick East after the 20-year lease on their previous studios, in Victoria St, Fitzroy, expired.
3RRR's mission statement was defined in 1990 as "To educate, inform and entertain by drawing upon appropriate community resources. To develop a critical approach to contemporary culture." 
Triple R's programming is split roughly 70% specialist music and 30% talk-based shows. Hosts have complete autonomy over content and the station does not have playlists. As such, the nature of 3RRR broadcasts varies wildly depending on the time of the week. 3RRR is funded entirely by community sponsorships and public subscribers (currently around 12,000), which, by removing standard commercial pressures, allows this diverse programming. 
Due to the reaction from subscribers, in the late 1990s 3RRR cancelled sponsorship deals signed with the Ford Motor Company and music venue The Mercury Lounge (due to its location in Melbourne's Crown Casino). No such "corporate" sponsorship of this type has been considered since. More recent sponsorship includes, for example, Dromana Estate who are "proud sponsors" of Plonk.    
With an eclectic mix of programmes and a commitment to independence and integrity, 3RRR has been cited as a model for community radio stations in other cities (such as Sydney's FBi Radio); it has been said that it is a cornerstone of Melbourne's alternative/underground culture. A large number of 3RRR presenters have gone on to work extensively for more commercial radio stations and for the ABC.

[[Hyperplane at infinity]]

CATEGORIES: Projective geometry, Infinity

By adding these ideal points, the entire affine space A is completed to a projective space P, which may be called the projective completion of A.  Each affine subspace S of A is completed to a projective subspace of P by adding to S all the ideal points corresponding to the directions of the lines contained in S.  The resulting projective subspaces are often called affine subspaces of the projective space P, as opposed to the infinite or ideal subspaces, which are the subspaces of the hyperplane at infinity (however, they are projective spaces, not affine spaces).
In the projective space, each projective subspace of dimension k intersects the ideal hyperplane in a projective subspace "at infinity" whose dimension is k − 1.
A pair of non-parallel affine hyperplanes intersect at an affine subspace of dimension n − 2, but a parallel pair of affine hyperplanes intersect at a projective subspace of the ideal hyperplane (the intersection lies on the ideal hyperplane). Thus, parallel hyperplanes, which did not meet in the affine space, intersect in the projective completion due to the addition of the hyperplane at infinity.

[[Online banking]]
CATEGORIES: Web applications, Banking technology

Online banking (or Internet banking or E-banking) allows customers of a financial institution to conduct financial transactions on a secured website operated by the institution, which can be a retail bank,virtual bank, credit union or building society.
To access a financial institution's online banking facility, a customer having personal Internet access must register with the institution for the service, and set up some password (under various names) for customer verification. The password for online banking is normally not the same as for banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers (also under various names), whether or not customers intend to access their online banking facility. Customers numbers are normally not the same as account numbers, because number of accounts can be linked to the one customer number. The customer will link to the customer number any of those accounts which the customer controls, which may be cheque, savings, loan, credit card and other accounts. Customer numbers will also not be the same as any debit or credit card issued by the financial institution to the customer.
To access online banking, the customer would go to the financial institution's website, and enter the online banking facility using the customer number and password. Some financial institutions have set up additional security steps for access, but there is no consistency to the approach adopted.

The characteristics of Roman theatres to those of earlier Greek theatres are due in large part to the influence of Ancient Greece on the Roman triumvir Pompey. Indeed, much of the architectural influence on the Romans came from the Greeks, and theatre structural design was no different from other buildings. However, Roman theatres have specific differences, such as being built upon their own foundations instead of earthen works or a hillside and being completely enclosed on all sides. Roman theatres derive their basic design from the Theatre of Pompey, the first permanent Roman theatre.

[[Chromolithography]]

CATEGORIES: Planographic printing, Printmaking

Chromolithography is a method for making multi-colour prints. This type of colour printing stemmed from the process of lithography, and it includes all types of lithography that are printed in colour.“Planographic Printing.” Seeing is Believing. 2001. The New York Public Library. 11 April 2007 .  When chromolithography is used to reproduce photographs, the term photochrome is frequently used.  Lithographers sought to find a way to print on flat surfaces with the use of chemicals instead of relief or intaglio printing.“Chromolithography and the Posters of World War I.” The War on the Walls. Temple University. 11 April 2007 . 
Chromolithography became the most successful of several methods of colour printing developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colours.  Hand-colouring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were coloured by hand by boys until 1875. The initial technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each colour, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colours present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers. However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colours used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. Cheaper images, like advertisements, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colours were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a “’chromo’”, a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.Clapper, Michael. “’I Was Once a Barefoot Boy!’: Cultural Tensions in a Popular Chromo.” American Art 16(2002): 16-39.

Transduction does not require physical contact between the cell donating the DNA and the cell receiving the DNA (which occurs in conjugation), and it is DNase resistant (transformation is susceptible to DNase). Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell's genome. 
When bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) infect a bacterial cell, their normal mode of reproduction is to harness the replicational, transcriptional, and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make numerous virions, or complete viral particles, including the viral DNA or RNA and the protein coat.

In computer science and quantum physics, the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle (CTD[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] principle) is a stronger, physical form of the Church–Turing thesis formulated by David Deutsch in 1985. The principle states that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process. The principle was originally stated by Deutsch with respect to finitary machines and processes. He immediately observed that classical physics, which makes use of the concept of real numbers, cannot be simulated by a Turing machine, which can only represent computable reals. Deutsch proposed that quantum computers may actually obey CTD, assuming that the laws of quantum physics can completely describe every physical process.

Gymnures are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews.

[[Cross-correlation]]

CATEGORIES: Bilinear operators, Covariance and correlation, Signal processing, Time domain analysis

In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature. It has applications in pattern recognition, single particle analysis, electron tomographic, averaging, cryptanalysis, and neurophysiology.
For continuous functions f and g, the cross-correlation is defined as:
Similarly, for discrete functions, the cross-correlation is defined as:
The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions.
In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero unless the signal is a trivial zero signal.
In probability theory and statistics, correlation is always used to include a standardising factor in such a way that correlations have values between −1 and +1, and the term cross-correlation is used for referring to the correlation corr(X, Y) between two random variables X and Y, while the "correlation" of a random vector X is considered to be the correlation matrix (matrix of correlations) between the scalar elements of X.

CATEGORIES: Inter-process communication

In computing, a named pipe (also known as a FIFO for its behavior) is an extension to the traditional pipe concept on Unix and Unix-like systems, and is one of the methods of inter-process communication (IPC). The concept is also found in Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is "unnamed" because it exists anonymously and persists only for as long as the process is running. A named pipe is system-persistent and exists beyond the life of the process and must be deleted once it is no longer being used. Processes generally attach to the named pipes (usually appearing as a file) to perform inter-process communication.

The Yellow and Black Attack is the first release from the Christian metal band Stryper. No singles were released from this six-song EP, and fewer than 20,000 copies were pressed, as their label, Enigma Records, was unsure of the potential market for Christian metal. CCM Magazine was slightly critical, citing production quality and the short length of the release, but commented that "Stryper has the promise of a major success story."
After Stryper achieved major success with their debut full-length album, Soldiers Under Command, The Yellow and Black Attack EP was reissued. Re-released on August 10, 1986 with two additional songs, "Reason for the Season" (which was originally released on a 1985 Christmas-themed 12" single with "Winter Wonderland") and a new, mellowed-down version of "My Love I'll Always Show", which dates from their Roxx Regime days. The version recorded for The Yellow and Black Attack featured less obvious Christian lyrics than the one to feature on The Roxx Regime Demos.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]

[[Outsiders (comics)]]

CATEGORIES: DC Comics titles, 1983 comic debuts, DC Comics superhero teams

The Outsiders is a fictional DC Comics superhero team. As its name suggests, the team consists of metahuman superheroes who do not fit the norms of the "mainstream" superhero community (the Justice League), and in some ways are similar to the X-Men of Marvel Comics. 
The Outsiders have had three incarnations. They were founded by Batman, whose ties to the League had become strained. The Outsiders were reformed in the early 2000s by Nightwing and Arsenal after The Titans dissolved following the events of 'Graduation Day', in which the heroine Donna Troy was killed by a rogue Superman android. The intention of this new team was to act as 'hunters', actively searching for superhuman criminals currently on the loose, rather than waiting for them to act and then responding as other super-vigilante groups often do. In its most recent formation the group's leadership was relinquished by Nightwing to Batman, who recruited former members and newcomers. He has stated his intention to use the team as a black ops version of the Justice League, able to take the proverbial "fall" in public opinion when the League cannot. After Batman's (apparent) death in Final Crisis, he posthumously charged Alfred Pennyworth with recruiting a new team of Outsiders for a forthcoming mission of "great importance".[tpl]Cite comic | writer=Tomasi, Peter | title=Batman and the Outsiders Special | volume=1 | issue=1 | date=Feb. 2009 | publisher=DC Comics[/tpl]

The Advanced Space Vision System (also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS) is a  computer vision system designed primarily for International Space Station (ISS) assembly.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|title=Space Vision System Helps Astronauts See in Space|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|year=2008|author=NRCC[/tpl] The system uses regular 2D cameras in the Space Shuttle bay, on the Canadarm, or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.
Because of the small number of viewing ports on the station and on the shuttle most of the assembly and maintenance is done using cameras, which do not give stereoscopic vision, and thus do not allow a proper evaluation of depth.  In addition the difficult conditions created by the particular conditions of illumination and obscurity in space, make it much more difficult to distinguish objects, even when the assembly work can be viewed directly, without using a camera.  For instance, the harsh glare of direct sunlight can blind human vision.  Also, the contrasts between objects in black shadows and objects in the solar light are much greater than in Earth's atmosphere, even where no glare is involved.

The newer 802.11n models allow users to stream audio from a computer running iTunes or mobile device running iOS 5+ to a stereo system using a feature called AirPlay.[tpl]cite web|title=AirPlay - AirPort Express|url=http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/features/airplay.html|publisher=Apple Inc.[/tpl]
When connected to an Ethernet network, the Express can function as a wireless access point. The current model allows up to 50 networked users. It can be used as an Ethernet-to-wireless bridge under certain wireless configurations. It can be used to extend the range of a network, or as a printer and audio server. The model introduced in June 2012 includes two Ethernet ports: one WAN and one LAN.Apple Press Info - Apple Unveils AirPort Express for Mac & PC Users
The original version (M9470LL/A, model A1084) was introduced by Apple on 7 June 2004, and included an analog–optical audio mini-jack output, a USB port for remote printing or charging the iPod (iPod shuffle only), and one Ethernet port. The main processor of the 802.11g AirPort Express is a Broadcom BCM4712KFB wireless networking chipset, which has a 200 MHz MIPS processor built in. The audio is handled by a Texas Instruments Burr-Brown PCM2705 16-bit digital-to-analog converter.
An updated version (MB321LL/A, model A1264) supporting the faster 802.11 Draft-N draft specification and operation in either of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, with almost all other features identical, was introduced by Apple in March 2008.Apple Press Info - Apple Introduces New AirPort Express with 802.11n The revised unit includes an 802.11a/n (5 GHz) mode, which allows adding Draft-N to an existing 802.11b/g network without disrupting existing connections, while preserving the increased throughput that Draft-N can provide.[ref]

Jack Butler (4 May 1901 – 10 May 1986) was the last native speaker of the Jiwarli language of Australia.
As the last speaker, he was the primary source for the documentation of the language. He was the son of a white father, a shepherd named Dick Butler, and an aboriginal Australian mother, Silver. He was raised by his mother and his mother and stepfather, Jinapuka, also aboriginal, in Ulwarra Station and Glen Florrie Station, in Australia.
In Glen Florrie Station he lived in a camp with aboriginals. He learned their languages and customs from the elders. His favorite language was Jiwarli, which he learned from a man named Wangki, known to white Australians as "Stumpy." He also learned to speak Jurruru and Thalanyji. Most of his adult life was spent in Mount Stuart Station, where he came into contact with the Western lifestyle. He married Molly Ashburton in 1927 and had four children with her. He retired in Onslow in the 1970s and died in Carnarvon on 10 May 1986.

Run by Tony Colston-Hayter and Paul Staines, the organisation was occasionally front-page news. In 1989, Colston-Hayter evaded imprisonment for organising an unlicensed party (Sunrise Midsummer Party at White Waltham Airfield aka "Ecstasy Airport" ) by claiming that he issued membership cards for Sunrise and it was a private party.Collin, M.

Red Thunder Cloud (May 30, 1919 – January 8, 1996), whose English name was Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West and who was also known as Carlos Westez, claimed to be the last  native speaker of the Catawba Indian language. His obituary was later published in this language in the New York Times. Born in Newport, Rhode Island, of African-American parents, his maternal grandfather was prominent African-American lawyer and community leader in Baltimore William Ashbie Hawkins. 
Cromwell West developed a passion for Native American history during his teenage years. He embraced a Native American identity and throughout his life, studied Native American languages extensively.
Gordon (2005) reports the other last native speakers of Catawba died before 1960. There are claims that Red Thunder Cloud is apparently an impostor and he is not really a native speaker of Catawban.Ives Goddard, "The Identity of Red Thunder Cloud", Smithsonian Institution, reprinted from Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter, April 2000, accessed 8 Apr 2010

Living along the Catawba and Wateree River, which they called both iswa (“river”), they called themselves therefore Kawahcatawbas ("the people of the river").
Primarily involved in agriculture, the Catawba were friendly toward early European colonists.  They were at almost constant war with tribes of other major language families: the Iroquois, who ranged south from the Great Lakes area and New York; the Algonquian Shawnee and Delaware; and the Iroquoian Cherokee, who fought for control over the large Ohio Valley (including what is now in present-day West Virginia).Sultzman, Lee. Catawba History. Clay Hound: Native American Traditional Pottery. (retrieved 14 March 2009) The Catawba allied during the American Revolutionary War with the Patriot colonists against the British. Decimated by earlier smallpox epidemics, tribal warfare and social disruption, the Catawba declined markedly in number in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The people ceded their homeland to South Carolina in 1840 by a treaty; it was not approved by the United States Senate and was automatically invalid.  
Terminated as a tribe by the federal government in 1959, the Catawba Indian Nation reorganized to reassert its government. In 1973 began its struggle to gain federal recognition. It accomplished this in 1993, along with a $50 million settlement by the federal government and state of South Carolina of its longstanding land claims. It was also officially recognized by the state of North Carolina in 1993. Its headquarters is at Rock Hill, South Carolina.
[tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], the population of the Catawba Nation has increased to about 2600, most in South Carolina, with smaller groups in Oklahoma, Colorado, and elsewhere. The Catawba Reservation ([tpl]coord|34|54|17|N|80|53|01|W|scale:50000_source:GNIS|display=inline[/tpl]), located in two disjoint sections in York County, South Carolina east of Rock Hill, reported a 2010 census population of 841 inhabitants. The Catawban language, which is being revived, is part of the Siouan family (Catawban branch).William C.

[[Intraocular lens]]

CATEGORIES: Eye, Vision, Ophthalmology, Corrective lenses, Disorders of lens, Medical specialties

An intraocular lens (IOL) is a lens implanted in the eye used to treat cataracts or myopia. The most common type of IOL is the pseudophakic IOL. These are implanted during cataract surgery, after the cloudy crystalline lens (otherwise known as a cataract) has been removed. The pseudophakic IOL replaces the original crystalline lens, and provides the light focusing function originally undertaken by the crystalline lens. The second type of IOL, more commonly known as a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), is a lens which is placed over the existing natural lens, and is used in refractive surgery to change the eye's optical power as a treatment for myopia or nearsightedness.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.08.014 |title=Phakic intraocular lenses |year=2010 |last1=Güell |first1=Jose Luis |last2=Morral |first2=Merce |last3=Kook |first3=Daniel |last4=Kohnen |first4=Thomas |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1976[/tpl] IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place within the capsular bag inside the eye.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1097/ICO.0b013e31802cbf3c |title=Comparison of Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) and Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) for Low Myopia |year=2006 |last1=Sanders |first1=Donald |last2=Vukich |first2=John A |journal=Cornea |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1139–46 |pmid=17172886[/tpl] IOLs were traditionally made of an inflexible material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.
Insertion of an intraocular lens for the treatment of cataracts is the most commonly performed eye surgical procedure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] Surgeons annually implant more than 6 million lensesGaudet, Jodie ed. 1001 Inventions That Changed the World, page 697, ISBN 978-0-7333-2536-6 The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches, and this procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. The recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should also visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months so as to monitor the implants.
IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation and night time halos, but a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Barsam A, Allan BD |title=Excimer laser refractive surgery versus phakic intraocular lenses for the correction of moderate to high myopia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=1 |pages=CD007679 |year=2012 |pmid=22258972 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007679.pub3[/tpl] Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading.

[[Border Terrier]]

The Border Terrier is a small, rough-coated breed of dog of the terrier group.  Originally bred as fox and vermin hunters, Border Terriers share ancestry with Dandie Dinmont Terriers, Patterdale terriers[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] and Bedlington Terriers.Border Terrier History  
Though the breed is much older, the Border Terrier was officially recognized by The Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1920, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930.  The border  terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which traveled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that traveled with them were not small enough to do the Border terrier's job.
In 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=Akc.org |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl] while it ranked 10th in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/887 |title=2006 Top 20 Breed Registrations |publisher=The Kennel Club |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl]

[[Pyloric stenosis]]

CATEGORIES: Congenital disorders of digestive system, Stomach disorders

Pyloric stenosis or pylorostenosis is narrowing (stenosis) of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum, due to enlargement (hypertrophy) of the muscle surrounding this opening (the pylorus, meaning "gate"), which spasms when the stomach empties. This condition causes severe projectile non-bilious vomiting. It most often occurs in the first few months of life, when it may thus be more specifically labeled as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hulka F, Campbell TJ, Campbell JR, Harrison MW |title=Evolution in the recognition of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis |journal=Pediatrics |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=E9 |year=1997 |pmid=9233980 |doi= 10.1542/peds.100.2.e9|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/100/2/e9[/tpl] The pyloric hypertrophy is felt classically as an olive-shaped mass in the middle upper part or right upper quadrant of the infant's abdomen.  In pyloric stenosis, it is uncertain whether there is a true congenital anatomic narrowing or whether there is merely a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle. This condition typically develops in male babies in the first 2 to 6 weeks of life.
Pyloric stenosis also occurs in adults, where the cause is usually a narrowed pylorus due to scarring from chronic peptic ulceration. This is a different condition from the infantile form.

Helix is a Canadian hard rock/heavy metal band.  They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single "Rock You."  The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick "Minstrel" Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith "Bert" Zurbrigg.  Their most well known lineup, however, and the one that recorded "Rock You", was the 80s version of the band:  Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent "The Doctor" Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg "Fritz" Hinz.  The history of the band has been marked by many lineup changes, with Vollmer being the sole constant member and only remaining member of the original lineup.  Although guitarist Paul Hackman was killed in a tour bus accident in 1992, the surviving members of the 80s lineup reunited in 2009 for an album and continue to tour in 2011.
Helix have toured with bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, Mötley Crüe, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan, and Motörhead among others.
Their most recent studio album is 2009's Vagabond Bones.

[[Lydian mode]]
CATEGORIES: Modes

The modern Lydian musical scale is a rising pattern of pitches comprising three whole tones, a semitone, two more whole tones, and a final semitone. This sequence of pitches roughly describes the fifth of the eight Gregorian (church) modes, known as Mode V or the authentic mode on F, theoretically using B[tpl]music|♮[/tpl] but in practice more commonly featuring B[tpl]music|♭[/tpl] (Powers 2001). Because of the importance of the major scale in modern music, the Lydian mode is often described (or learned) as the scale that begins on the fourth scale degree of the major scale, or alternatively, as the major scale with the fourth scale degree raised half a step.

A Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small Scottish breed of dog in the terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a distinctive "top-knot" of hair on the head. A character in Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the breed, with "Dandie Dinmont" thought to be based on James Davidson, who is credited as being the "father" of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland. 
There are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly, but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, but they can be affected by spinal issues due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.

CATEGORIES: English folk musical groups, Chamber jazz ensembles, Virgin Records artists, E.G. Records artists

The Penguin Cafe Orchestra (PCO) was a collective of performing musicians founded by classically trained British guitarist, composer and arranger Simon Jeffes. Jeffes and cellist co-founder Helen Liebmann were core members throughout its life and a number of other musicians joined as the band grew and developed, many of whom appear on the PCO's six studio and two live albums.
The PCO toured extensively during the 1980s and 1990s, and two albums, When in Rome... (1988) and Concert Program (1995) captured the sound of the live ensemble. The Penguin's sound is not easily categorized, but has elements of exuberant folk music and a minimalist aesthetic occasionally reminiscent of composers such as Philip Glass. 
The Penguin Cafe Orchestra recorded and performed for 24 years until Jeffes died of a brain tumour in 1997.  Several remaining members of the original group  reunited for  three concerts in 2007. Since then five original members have continued to play concerts of the Penguins music, initially as 'The Anteaters' and more recently under the name 'The Orchestra That Fell to Earth'.
Simon Jeffes' son, Arthur Jeffes, subsequently founded a distinct successor band called simply Penguin Cafe in 2009, which features no original PCO members.  This new ensemble does, however, feature many PCO numbers in its live repertoire, and also records and performs new music written by the younger Jeffes.

The Battle of Stångebro or Battle of Linköping took place at Linköping, Sweden on 25 September 1598 and effectively ended the personal union between Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, that had existed since 1592.  In the battle, an army of ca 8,000-12,000 commanded by Duke Charles defeated a mixed force of ca 5,000-8,000 consisting of an invading army of mercenaries in the king's employ and diverse but poorly co-ordinated supporting Swedish noblemen's forces commanded by King of both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Sigismund III Vasa, who was acting to maintain and restore his personal union against anti-Catholic forces in Lutheran Sweden. The Swedish kings general Constantin fought at the western bridge.
The battle was the beginning of the seven decades long Polish–Swedish Wars, which eventually destroyed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time, arguably the largest nation state in Europe. Like the Thirty Years' War which also involved Sweden, under the surface, the dynastic struggles were rooted firmly in religious strife between Protestants and Roman Catholics.
Sigismund was captured during the battle, but as the Polish-Lithuanian crowned head of state, allowed to return to the commonwealth. He'd engendered the civil war by violating his pledge to not interfere in religious matters in Sweden, nor to further the Catholic cause in Sweden.

The film is also the last film in both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare franchises before they were both rebooted.
In the film, Freddy (Robert Englund) has grown incapable of haunting people's dreams as the citizens of Springwood, Ohio have mostly forgotten about Freddy with the passage of time, as well as the fact that the current generation of teenagers are kept ignorant of his existence. In order to regain his power, Freddy manipulates Jason, (Ken Kirzinger), into resurrecting himself and traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear, leading to rumors that Freddy has returned. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, Jason angers Freddy by depriving Krueger of his potential victims. This ultimately sends the two undying monsters into a violent conflict.
This film marked Robert Englund's final appearance to date as Freddy Krueger, having portrayed him in all seven previous Nightmare films and the 1980s TV series, as well as the first movie since Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood not to feature Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees. This is also Ken Kirzinger's second appearance as Jason; having doubled for Hodder in the film Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan. The film served as Grammy-winning R&B singer Kelly Rowland's debut as an actress.

A Finnish Spitz (Finnish language: Suomenpystykorva) is a breed of dog originating in Finland.  The breed was originally bred to hunt all types of game from squirrels and other rodents to bears.Morris, p.316.  It is a "bark pointer", indicating the position of game by barking. Barking also makes the game animal focus on the dog, not on the hunter. Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting moose and elk. Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog. The breed is friendly and in general loves children, so it is suitable for domestic life. The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979.

In 1893 he discovered that a steady electric field applied to certain birefringent materials causes the refractive index to vary, approximately in proportion to the strength of the field.  The coefficient of proportionality is of the order of [tpl]Val|10|e=-10|u=V−1[/tpl] to [tpl]Val|10|e=-12|u=V−1[/tpl]. This phenomenon is now called the Pockels effect.

[[CEA Valduc]]
CATEGORIES: Military of France, Nuclear weapons program of France

CEA/Valduc or the Valduc Centre for Nuclear Studies is a French nuclear 
facility (CEA, direction of military applications) dedicated to the study, manufacturing, maintenance and dismantling of nuclear weapons.
The site was acquired in 1957 by the CEA and the centre built in 1958.  It has an area of 6.7 km² (now 7.5 km²), while the actual site occupies 1.8 km².  Seventeen basic nuclear installations are on the site, comprising a total of 25,000 m² of floor space. The centre is surrounded by a zone where photography and cartography are prohibited but through traffic is permitted on roads.
There are about 1,000 CEA employees working in the center, as well as about 300 employees from contractors. It seems that most employees commute from Is-sur-Tille and Dijon; the CEA charters buses bringing employees from various locations in the Dijon agglomeration.
Since a restructuring decision of the CEA in 1996, Valduc is the sole site responsible for military nuclear material. From 1980 to 1993, the French Air Force occupied at 0.4 km² plot where it operated a plant for the assembly of nuclear warheads for air and land-based missiles (ASMP and Hadès).
A proportion of the locals consider that Valduc does not bring benefits to the area but imposes constraints and discourages people from coming to the area. This is partly because most employees commute from away and the centre did not pay local taxes to the commune of Pairengni (because it is a public research establishment). However the commune government asserts that some of the activities at CEA/Valduc are taxable. In 2003, Valduc was considered partially taxable, a move which the CEA contested.(CEA, Financial report 2003). The Dijon administrative court considered that activities related to the military were not taxable but those pertaining to general technology development and consulting for private industry were taxable.

The Battle of Preston (9–14 November 1715), also referred to as the Preston Fight, was fought during the Jacobite Rising of 1715 (often referred to as the First Jacobite Rising, or Rebellion by supporters of the Hanoverian government).
The Jacobites moved south into England with little opposition, and by the time they reached Preston in Lancashire had grown to about 4,000 in number. Their horse troops entered Preston on the night of 9 November 1715, and as they approached two troops of dragoons and part of a militia regiment retreated to Wigan.
General Charles Wills was ordered to halt their advance, and left Manchester on 11 November with six regiments, arriving on the 12th. The Jacobite leader Thomas Forster, a Northumberland squire, had intended to move on that day, but, learning of Wills's approach, decided to stay and made the mistake of withdrawing troops from a strong defensive position at Ribble bridge, [tpl]convert|0.5|mi|km[/tpl] outside Preston.
The Jacobites had barricaded the principal streets of Preston, and Wills ordered an immediate attack, which met with fire from the barricades and from houses, resulting in the Hanoverian attack being repulsed with heavy losses. Wills then had houses set on fire, with the aim of fires spreading along to the Jacobite positions, and the Jacobites tried to do the same to houses taken as government positions. At night, Wills's order to light the government-held positions for identification helped the Jacobite snipers, but overnight many Jacobites left the town. The legend of these actions is recounted in a well-known Lancashire ballad, Lo! The Bird is Fallen.http://www.mythop.co.uk/site/edward.htm
On the morning of Sunday 13 November more government forces arrived and, finding that the town was insufficiently encircled, Wills stationed more troops to prevent the besieged Jacobite army from escaping. The Jacobites had also suffered losses in the fighting, as well as losing defectors overnight, and although the Highlanders' full intention was to fight on and take the attack to the enemy, Forster agreed to an offer from his officer Colonel Oxburgh to open negotiations with Wills for capitulation on favourable terms. This was done without informing the Highlanders, but Wills refused to treat with rebels. When the Highlanders learned of this that night, they were infuriated and paraded the streets threatening any Jacobites who might even allude to a surrender, killing or wounding several people.
At seven o'clock on the morning of Monday 14 November, Forster offered an unconditional surrender, which was turned down unless it applied to the Highlanders. Forster then sent back confirmation that the Scots noblemen would surrender on the same terms. When the government forces entered the town, the Highlanders were drawn up under arms in the market-place ready to surrender.
1,468 Jacobites were taken prisoner, 463 of them English. George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton, William Gordon, 6th Viscount of Kenmure, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, and William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne, were among those captured and later sentenced to be executed for treason under an act of attainder. However, Winton and Nithsdale escaped from the Tower of London. All surviving prisoners except for members of the Clan Gregor were later pardoned by the Indemnity Act 1717.
Seventeen Jacobites were killed and twenty-five wounded. Government casualties were close to 300 killed and wounded.The best discussion of this is by the historian and military expert J. Baynes in his The Jacobite Rising of 1715 (1970), pp. 126–127. Of the ordinary Highland clansmen defeated at the Battle of Preston, many were transported to the Americas.Mackintosh at myclan.com
The battle of Preston is often claimed to have been the last fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of "battle", for which there are different interpretations. Preston was a siege rather than a pitched battle, so the Battle of Sedgemoor fought in 1685 is also a contender for the title of the last battle, as is the skirmish at Clifton Moor near Penrith in Cumbria on 18 December 1745 during the 'Forty-Five' Jacobite Rebellion. However, there was a great deal of savage fighting in streets all over the town during the Battle of Preston, far more than in most sieges. It was as much of a battle as, for example, the Battle of St Albans (1455) in the Wars of the Roses, which was also fought in the streets of a town, but which is generally regarded as a battle and not a siege, as is the Battle of Reading of 1688. The Battle of Bossenden Wood, fought on 31 May 1838, is a much later contender.

[tpl]Other people2|Zhukovsky (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Zhukovsky[/tpl]
Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky ([tpl]lang-ru|Никола́й Его́рович Жуко́вский[/tpl]; [tpl]OldStyleDate|January 17|1847|January 5[/tpl], Orekhovo, Vladimir Governorate – March 17, 1921, Moscow) was a Russian scientist and a founding father of modern aero- and hydrodynamics. Whereas contemporary scientists scoffed at the idea of human flight, Zhukovsky was the first to undertake the study of airflow.
His name is usually romanised as Joukovsky or Joukowsky in the literature. See for example Joukowsky transform (also Kutta-Schukowski transform), Kutta–Joukowski theorem and so on.
Zhukovsky was born in the village of Orekhovo, Vladimir Governorate, Russian Empire. In 1868 he graduated from Moscow University where he studied under August Davidov. From 1872 he was a professor at the Imperial Technical School. In 1904 he established the world's first Aerodynamic Institute in Kachino near Moscow. From 1918 he was the head of TsAGI (Central AeroHydroDynamics Institute).
He was the first scientist to explain mathematically the origin of aerodynamic lift, through his circulation hypothesis, the first to establish that the lift force generated by a body moving through an ideal fluid is proportional to the velocity and the circulation around the body. He used a conformal mathematical transformation to define the ideal shape of the aerodynamic profile having as essential elements a rounded nose (leading edge), double surface (finite thickness), cambered or symmetrical, and a sharp tail (trailing edge). He built the first wind tunnel in Russia. He was also responsible for the eponymous water hammer equation used by civil engineers. This is usually known as the Joukowsky equation.
A city near Moscow and the crater Zhukovskiy on the Moon are named in his honor.
The Russian Air Force academy has been named in his honor: Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy ([tpl]lang-ru|Военно-воздушная инженерная академия имени профессора Н.Е. Жуковского[/tpl]) later reorganized into Zhukovsky – Gagarin Air Force Academy ([tpl]lang-ru|Военно-воздушная академия имени профессора Н.Е. Жуковского и Ю.А. Гагарина[/tpl])

Its causes are numerous. Generally it occurs because of damage to the kidney tissue caused by decreased renal blood flow (renal ischemia) from any cause (e.g. low blood pressure), exposure to substances harmful to the kidney, an inflammatory process in the kidney, or an obstruction of the urinary tract which impedes the flow of urine. AKI is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, or inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine.
AKI may lead to a number of complications, including metabolic acidosis, high potassium levels, uremia, changes in body fluid balance, and effects to other organ systems. Management includes supportive care, such as renal replacement therapy, as well as treatment of the underlying disorder.

[[Chronic kidney disease]]

CATEGORIES: Kidney diseases, Organ failure

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease (CRD), is a progressive loss in renal function over a period of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are non-specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and those with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia or pericarditis.[tpl]cite web | author=National Kidney Foundation | title=K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease | url=http://www.kidney.org/professionals/KDOQI/guidelines_ckd | year=2002 | accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl] It is differentiated from acute kidney disease in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months.
Chronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine. Higher levels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result a decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine levels may be normal in the early stages of CKD, and the condition is discovered if urinalysis (testing of a urine sample) shows that the kidney is allowing the loss of protein or red blood cells into the urine. To fully investigate the underlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests and often renal biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed to find out if there is a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction. Recent professional guidelines classify the severity of chronic kidney disease in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end stage renal disease (ESRD), end stage renal failure (ESRF), or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic kidney failure (CKF) or chronic renal failure (CRF).
There is no specific treatment unequivocally shown to slow the worsening of chronic kidney disease. If there is an underlying cause to CKD, such as vasculitis, this may be treated directly to slow the damage. In more advanced stages, treatments may be required for anemia and bone disease. Severe CKD requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant.

The Battle of Point Pleasant — known as the Battle of Kanawha in some older accounts — was the only major action of Dunmore's War. It was fought on October 10, 1774, primarily between Virginia militia and American Indians from the Shawnee and Mingo tribes. Along the Ohio River near modern Point Pleasant, West Virginia, American Indians under the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk attacked Virginia militia under Colonel Andrew Lewis, hoping to halt Lewis's advance into the Ohio Valley. After a long and furious battle, Cornstalk retreated. After the battle, the Virginians, along with a second force led by Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, marched into the Ohio Valley and compelled Cornstalk to agree to a treaty, ending the war.

[[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory]]
CATEGORIES: Acid-base chemistry, Equilibrium chemistry

In chemistry, the Brønsted–Lowry theory is an acid–base reaction theory, proposed independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923.R.H. Petrucci, W.S. Harwood, and F.G. Herring, General Chemistry (8th edn, Prentice-Hall 2002), p.666G.L. Miessler and D.A. Tarr, Inorganic Chemistry (2nd edn, Prentice-Hall 1998), p.154 The fundamental concept of this theory is that an acid (or Brønsted acid) is defined as being able to lose, or "donate" a proton (the hydrogen cation, or H+) while a base (or Brønsted base) is defined as a species with the ability to gain, or "accept," a proton.

CATEGORIES: 1955 establishments in Italy, 1989 disestablishments in Italy, Radical parties, Liberal parties in Italy, Political parties established in 1955, Political parties disestablished in 1989

The Radical Party (Partito Radicale, PR) was a political party in Italy. For decades it was a bastion of liberalism and radicalism in Italy and proposed itself as the strongest opposition to the Italian political establishment, seen as corrupt and conservative. Although it never reached high shares of vote and never participated in government, the party had close relations with the other parties of the Italian left, from the Republicans and the Socialists to the Communists and Proletarian Democracy, and opened its ranks also to members of other parties, through "double membership".
In 1989 the PR was transformed into the Transnational Radical Party. The current incarnation of the party is the Italian Radicals, founded in 2001, after that in the 1990s the Radicals had formed a succession of electoral lists (notably including Pannella List and Bonino List), without having a structured party and sometimes dividing themselves in competing lists.

[[AGM-69 SRAM]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear weapons of the United States, Cold War air-to-surface missiles of the United States, Nuclear air-to-surface missiles

The Boeing AGM-69 SRAM (Short-range attack missile) was a nuclear air-to-surface missile designed to replace the older AGM-28 Hound Dog stand-off missile. 
The requirement for the weapon was issued by the Strategic Air Command of the USAF in 1964, and the resultant AGM-69A SRAM entered service in 1972. It was carried by the B-52, the FB-111A, and, for a very short period starting in 1986, by the B-1Bs based at Dyess AFB in Texas. SRAMs were also carried by the B-1Bs based at Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, and McConnell AFB in Kansas up until late 1993.
SRAM  had an inertial navigation system as well as a radar altimeter which enabled the missile to be launched in either a semi-ballistic or terrain-following flight path.  The SRAM was also capable of performing one "major maneuver" during its flight which gave the missile the capability of reversing its course and attacking targets that were behind it, sometimes called an "over-the-shoulder" launch. The missile had a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of about [tpl]convert|1400|ft|disp=flip[/tpl] and a maximum range of [tpl]convert|110|nmi|km|disp=flip[/tpl]. The SRAM used a single W69 nuclear warhead with a variable yield of 17 kilotons as a fission weapon, or 210 kilotons as a fusion weapon with Tritium boost enabled. The aircrew could turn a switch on the Class III command to select the destructive yield required.
The SRAM missile was completely coated with 2 cm of soft rubber, used to absorb radar energy and also dissipate heat during flight.  The three fins on the tail were made of a phenolic material, also designed to minimize any reflected radar energy. All electronics, wiring, and several safety devices were routed along the top of the missile, inside a raceway.
On the B-52, SRAMs were carried externally on 2 wing pylons (6 missiles on each pylon) and internally on an eight-round rotary launcher mounted in the bomb bay; maximum loadout was 20 missiles.  The B-1B could carry 8 missiles on up to three rotary launchers (one in each of its three stores bays) for a maximum loadout of 24 missiles.  The FB-111A could carry two missiles internally and four more missiles under the aircraft's swing-wing.  On the FB-111A, the externally mounted missiles required the addition of a tailcone to reduce aerodynamic drag during supersonic flight.  Upon rocket motor ignition, this tailcone was blown away by the exhaust plume.
About 1,500 missiles were built at a cost of about $592,000 each by the time production ended in 1975. The Boeing Company sub-contracted with the Lockheed Propulsion Company for the propellants, which subsequently closed with the end of the SRAM program. 
An upgraded AGM-69B was proposed in the late 1970s, with an upgraded motor to be built by Thiokol and a W80 warhead, but it was cancelled (along with the B-1A) in 1978. Various plans for alternative guidance schemes, including an anti-radar seeker for use against air defense installations and even a possible air-to-air missile version, came to nothing.
A new weapon, the AGM-131 SRAM II, began development in 1981, intended to arm the resurrected B-1B, but it was cancelled in 1991 by then president George H. W. Bush along with most of the U.S. Strategic Modernization effort (including Peacekeeper Mobile (Rail) Garrison, Small ICBM and Minuteman III modernization) in an effort by the U.S. to ease nuclear pressure on the disintegrating Soviet Union.
The AGM-69A was finally retired in 1993 over growing concerns about the safety of its warhead and rocket motor. With the end of the Cold War it is unlikely to be replaced in the immediate future.  There were serious concerns about the solid rocket motor, when several motors suffered cracking of the propellant, thought to occur due to the hot/cold cycling year after year.  Cracks in the propellant could cause catastrophic failure once ignited.
The SRAM was effectively replaced by the AGM-86 cruise missile, which has longer range, though easier to intercept.

Wambierzyce [tpl]IPAc-pl|w|a|m|b|ʲ|e|'|ż|y|c|e[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-de|Albendorf[/tpl], [tpl]lang-cs|Vambeřice[/tpl]), the "Silesian Jerusalem", is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in southern Poland. The village is situated at an altitude of 370–410 m in the picturesque Cedron valley on the eastern slopes of the Table Mountains in Lower Silesian Voivodeship. The place was first mentioned in 1330 Alberndorf, 1398 Alberdorf, 1418 Alberti villa, 1560 Alberichsdorf, which then evolved into the (German) name Albendorf. Czech pilgrims from Bohemia and Moravia called the place Vambeřice. When Lower Silesia became part of Poland in 1945/1946, the Polish name Wambierzyce became the official name of the village. Today Wambierzyce is part of the district called Gmina Radków in Kłodzko County. It lies approximately [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|0[/tpl] south-east of Radków, [tpl]convert|17|km|mi|0[/tpl] west of Kłodzko, and [tpl]convert|84|km|mi|0[/tpl] south-west of the regional capital Wrocław.
The wooden statue of Our Lady, dating from the thirteenth century, was originally placed in a mighty linden tree located at this site. According to the legend a blind man regained his eyesight after praying before the statue. After that miracle a stone altar was erected in front of the tree. The first wooden chapel was built in 1263. A larger church was built in 1512 but was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. The present  pilgrimage church 'Visitation of Our Lady' goes back to a church built in 1695–1710 following a design thought to resemble the Temple in Jerusalem. However, all but the mighty Renaissance façade had to be torn down already three years later because the structure had become unsafe. The fourth and present church in Baroque style was then built 1715–1723, and financed by the local nobleman and owner Count Franz Anton von Götzen. In 1936 the church received the status of a 'Basilica minor' from Pope Pius XI. Pope John Paul II awarded the Madonna of Wambierzyce the title of "Queen of Families" in 1980.

ǂKxʼao-ǁʼae (ǂKxʼauǁʼein, Auen, Kaukau) is a southeastern variety of the !Xuun dialect continuum, spoken in Botswana (Grootelaagte, East Hanahai, Kanagas, and Ghanzi villages in Ghanzi District, and on the commercial farms) and in Namibia (Gobabis, and settlements along the C22 road to Otjinene as far as Eiseb (Omaheke District)) by about 7,000 people. In Botswana, most speakers are bilingual in Naro or Tswana.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
There are numerous spellings of the name, including ǁAuǁei, ǁX’auǁ’e, and Auen. Endonyms are Juǀʼhoan, ǃXuun in Namibia and ǂKx'ao||'ae (predominantly in Botswana) meaning "northern people" in Naro. It also goes by the names Gobabis ǃKung and Kaukau (which can take the noun class prefixes in Tswana to give Mokaukau for one person, Bakaukau for the group, and Sekaukau for the language).
In Namibia, ǂKx'ao||'ae tends to refer literally to the !Xuun speakers to the north in the Caprivi area. With the exception of a few cultural traits, speakers of ǂKx'ao||'ae in Botswana and those of Ju|'hoan in Namibia argue that they are one and the same people, speaking one language, with some dialectal attributes.
The non-Roman characters used by the language predominantly refer to click consonants and follow the orthography by Patrick Dickens for Ju|'hoan.
The limited data on these dialects are poorly transcribed.

[[Dalitz plot]]

CATEGORIES: Plots (graphics), Scattering, Particle physics

The Dalitz plot is a ternary plot often used in particle physics to represent the relative frequency of various (kinematically distinct) manners in which the products of certain (otherwise similar) three-body decays may move apart.[ref]
</ref>
The kinematics of a three-body decay can be completely described using two variables. In a traditional Dalitz plot, the axes of the plot are the squares of the invariant masses of two pairs of the decay products. (For example, if particle A decays to particles 1, 2, and 3, a Dalitz plot for this decay could plot m212 on the x-axis and m223 on the y-axis.) If there are no angular correlations between the decay products then the distribution of these variables is flat. However symmetries may impose certain restrictions on the distribution.  Furthermore, three-body decays are often dominated by resonant processes, in which the particle decays into two decay products, with one of those decay products immediately decaying into two additional decay products. In this case, the Dalitz plot will show a non-uniform distribution, with a peak around the mass of the resonant decay. In this way, the Dalitz plot provides an excellent tool for studying the dynamics of three-body decays and they are one of the tools applied in the search for the Higgs boson.A. Kasmi, Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in final states with photons or taus at the Tevatron, PoS (EPS-HEP 2011) 237
R.H. Dalitz introduced this technique in 1953 to study decays of K mesons (which at that time were still referred to as "tau-mesons"). It can be adapted to the analysis of four-body decays as well.[ref]
</ref>  A specific form of a four-particle Dalitz plot (for non-relativistic kinematics), which is based on a tetrahedral coordinate system, was first applied to study the few-body dynamics in atomic four-body fragmentation processes.

In psychogeography, a dérive is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, on which the subtle aesthetic contours of the surrounding architecture and geography subconsciously direct the travellers, with the ultimate goal of encountering an entirely new and authentic experience. Situationist theorist Guy Debord defines the dérive as "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances." He also notes that "the term also designates a specific uninterrupted period of dériving."Guy Debord (1958) Definitions. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.

Since 1857 there have been three surfboats for maritime rescue stationed at Margate, on the eastern tip of Kent. They were run as cooperatives, with local boatmen clubbing together to buy them and then receiving a share of any salvage money received.
The first, the Friend of all Nations was wrecked in 1860 but returned to service until 1877. 9 crew of the Friend to all Nations died in the storm of 1897, but the boat survived both that and being lost while under tow the following year. A memorial to the 9 men stands on the Margate seafront.
A third boat was built in 1899 but by then surfboats powered by oar and sail had been largely superseded by lifeboats. The third boat served as a tender at Chatham during WWII and was lost off Ostend in 1957. All three were built by J. Samuel White of Cowes.

[[Ciguatera]]
CATEGORIES: Toxic effect of noxious substances eaten as food

Ciguatera is a foodborne illness caused by eating certain reef fish whose flesh is contaminated with toxins originally produced by dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus which live in tropical and subtropical waters. These dinoflagellates adhere to coral, algae and seaweed, where they are eaten by herbivorous fish who in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. In this way the toxins move up the food chain and biomagnify. 
According to Dr. McBoomlis, Gambierdiscus toxicus is the primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar toxins that cause ciguatera. These toxins include ciguatoxin, maitotoxin, scaritoxin and palytoxin. Predator species near the top of the food chain in tropical and subtropical waters, such as barracudas, snapper, moray eels, parrotfishes, groupers, triggerfishes and amberjacks, are most likely to cause ciguatera poisoning, although many other species cause occasional outbreaks of toxicity.
Ciguatoxin is odourless, tasteless and very heat-resistant, so ciguatoxin-laden fish cannot be detoxified by conventional cooking.[tpl]cite journal |author=Swift A, Swift T |title=Ciguatera |journal=J.

Dell'Arcano del Mare by Sir Robert Dudley is a 17th-century maritime encyclopaedia, the sixth part of which comprises a maritime atlas of the entire world, which is the first such in print, the first made by an Englishman, and the first to use the Mercator projection. The work was first published in Italian at Florence in 1645 and 1646 in three folio volumes.
Among other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a navy in five rates (sizes) which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition.

[[Webring]]

CATEGORIES: World Wide Web, Internet properties established in 1995, Discontinued Yahoo! services

A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social.ICT Roger Crawford - Heinemann IGCSE - glossary They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.
To be a part of the webring, each site has a common navigation bar; it contains links to the previous and next site. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term webring. However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.
A web ring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a web ring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic.ICT Roger Crawford - Heinemann IGCSE - Chapter 7 page 192 
Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the web ring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by 'linking in' to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML or JavaScript to their site.
Sites usually join a webring in order to receive traffic from related sites. When used to improve search engine rankings, webrings can be considered a search engine optimization technique.

Northern England, also known as the North of England, the North or the North Country, is a cultural region of England.

It extends roughly from the River Trent to the south,[tpl]cite web |title=Entire Catchment Flood Modelling as a Planning Tool – River Trent Case Study|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090914214327/http://glenelg-hopkinsvicgovau.ascetinteractive.com.au/images/file/Joel%20Leister%20-%20Entire%20Catchment%20Flood%20Modelling%20as%20a%20Planning%20Tool.doc|publisher=Glenelg Hopkins CMA[/tpl] Retrieved on 23 February 2009. to Scotland in the north.
Northern England includes three Euro constituencies: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.5 million and an area of 37,331 km2 (14,414 sq mi).
During antiquity most of the area was part of Brigantia—homeland of the Brigantes and the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain. After the Roman conquest of Britain the city of York became capital of the area, called Britannia Inferior then Britannia Secunda. In Sub-Roman Britain new Brythonic kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd ("Old North") emerged. The Angle settlers created Bernicia and Deira from which came Northumbria and a Golden Age in cultural, scholarly and monastic activity,  centred on Lindisfarne and aided by Irish monks.[tpl]cite web |title=Historical background to The Golden Age|url=http://www.goldenageofnorthumbria.com/history.html|publisher=Golden Age of Northumbria[/tpl] Retrieved on 23 February 2009. Norse and Gaelic Viking raiders gained control of much of the area, creating the Danelaw. During this time there were close relations with Mann and the Isles, Dublin and Norway. Northumbria was unified with the rest of England under Eadred around 952.
After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction, but afterwards many towns were built and founded. A Council of the North was in place during the Late Middle Ages until the Commonwealth after the Civil War. The area experienced Anglo–Scottish border fighting until the unification of Britain under the Stuarts.

The position of lieutenant governor of Ohio was established in 1852.[tpl]cite web | last =Husted| first =Jon| authorlink =Jon Husted | title =Lieutenant Governors of the State of Ohio: 1852 - present | publisher = Ohio Secretary of State | accessdate = 2012-01-24 | url = http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain/HistoricalElectionComparisons/Lieutenant%20Governors%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Ohio%201852%20-%20present.aspx [/tpl]  The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the governor resigns, dies in office or is removed by impeachment. Before 1852, the president of the Ohio State Senate would serve as acting governor if a vacancy in the governorship occurred. Until 1978, lieutenant governors were elected separately but concurrently with the governor (not on a "ticket"). Thus, there were several occasions when the lieutenant governor was from a different party than the governor. This was changed by constitutional amendment. In 1974, Richard F. Celeste was the last lieutenant governor to be elected separately. In 1978, George Voinovich became the first lieutenant governor to be elected on the same ticket with the governor.
From 1852 to 1979, the lieutenant governor also served as the president of the Ohio State Senate.  More recently, Ohio governors have generally named the lieutenant governor to head an agency of state government.  An example of this is Bruce Edward Johnson, who served as Director of the Ohio Department of Development, as did his successor, Lee Fisher.
The 28th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, later served as 29th President of the United States.

[[Spezi]]
CATEGORIES: German cuisine, Citrus sodas

Spezi is a soft drink made with cola and orange soda. It is a  genericized trademark; its owner of the trademark is Brauhaus Riegele in Augsburg, Germany. When the brand was registered in 1956, Riegele at first was selling beer under the trademark. When Spezi is bottled by other breweries, it usually runs under the official title "Cola-Mix". 
In most of Germany and Austria, Spezi is a generic term for a mixture of cola and orange soda. Riegele registered the trademark and tried to monopolise the use of the term, but did not achieve that goal. Most large beverage manufacturers sell similar products, though most of them only in Germany. Examples are Schwip Schwap by PepsiCo or Mezzo Mix by the Coca-Cola Company. Nowadays, these two competitors sell far better than the original Spezi. However, original Spezi, in contrast to its main competitors, is not available in some parts of Germany, particularly in large parts of former East Germany, which is  probably one of the reasons for its smaller market share. Like other colas, Spezi contains caffeine; other ingredients include water, sugar, carbonic acid, orange juice and lemon juice.
Riegele Spezi is sold mostly in half litre glass bottles, but 0.33l and 1.5l bottles are available as well. There is also a diet version. The slogan is: "Spezi ist Spitze - trink das Original!" ("Spezi is great - drink the original!").
Spezi is sometimes called "Kalter Kaffee" ("cold coffee") because of its color. In some regions of northern Germany (Emsland), Spezi stands for a mixture of traditional German Schnapps and cola.

Stuttgart Region (Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is a metropolitan area in Germany and consists of the city of Stuttgart and the surrounding districts of Ludwigsburg, Esslingen, Böblingen, Rems-Murr and Göppingen (each 10–20 km from Stuttgart city center). About 2.7 million inhabitants live in  that area (3,700 km²). In fact, with 708 people per square kilometre, the Stuttgart Region is one of the most densely populated areas in Germany. Stuttgart Region is governed by a directly elected parliament.
Situated at the heart of Baden-Württemberg and Europe, the Stuttgart Region is the hub of economic, scientific, and political life in Southwest Germany. The area currently has Germany's highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations, and tops the national league for patent applications. The Gross Domestic Product for Stuttgart Region was recorded at about €35,000 per capita and about €64,000 per employed person. The unemployment rate is only 4.8 per cent. Stuttgart Region is one of Europe's most important and most successful economic centres. This is due not only to the influence of leading international companies, such as Daimler, Porsche, Robert Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard and IBM (all of whom have their world or German headquarters here), but also to the influence of world-renowned medium-sized enterprises such as Behr, Dürr, Kärcher, Märklin, Stihl, Festo, TTS Tooltechnic Systems, GEZE and Trumpf. In total, approximately 150,000 companies are located in the Stuttgart Region. 24 per cent of employees in the Stuttgart Region work in the high-tech sector – a European record.

[[Relocation of professional sports teams]]

CATEGORIES: Sports team relocations

Relocation of professional sports teams is a practice which involves a sporting franchise moving from one metropolitan area to another, although occasionally moves between municipalities in the same conurbation are also included. Professional teams in North America are generally privately owned and operate according to the wishes of an owner, making this practice much more common there than in other areas of the world where sporting teams are clubs owned by local members.

[[Historical federal electoral districts of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian electoral districts

This is a list of past arrangements of Canada's electoral districts. Each district sends one member to the Canadian House of Commons.  In 1999 and 2003, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario was elected using the same districts within that province.  96 of Ontario's 107 provincial electoral districts, roughly those outside Northern Ontario, remain coterminous with their federal counterparts.
Federal electoral districts in Canada are re-adjusted every ten years based on the Canadian census and proscribed by various constitutional seat guarantees, including the use of a Grandfather clause, for Quebec, the Central Prairies and the Maritime provinces, with the essential proportions between the remaining provinces being "locked" no matter any further changes in relative population as have already occurred.  Any major changes to the status quo, if proposed, would require constitutional amendments approved by seven out of ten provinces with two-thirds of the population to ratify constitutional changes allowing changes in the existing imbalance of seats between various provinces. During the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, an attempt was made to get around this by adding additional seats. These 30 new seats, if given final approval, would be the largest increase in the number of seats at any single redistribution since confederation.

The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two or off guard,Shooting guards are 6'3"–6'7". BBC Sports academy. URL last accessed 2006-09-09. is one of five traditional positions on a basketball team. Players of the position are often shorter, leaner, and quicker than forwards. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for his team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. Kobe Bryant, for example, is a shooting guard who is as good a playmaker as he is a scorer; other examples of combo guards are Jamal Crawford, Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, Gilbert Arenas, Tyreke Evans, and Jason Terry. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. Notable swing men (also known as wing players) include Andre Iguodala,  Paul Pierce, Evan Turner, Stephen Jackson, and Tracy McGrady, also Rudy Fernández having an under average size for small forward.
Notable shooting guards include current NBA players Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Ray Allen, Manu Ginóbili, Vince Carter,   Joe Johnson, Arron Afflalo, James Harden, Paul George, Monta Ellis,  DeMar DeRozan and former players Michael Jordan, Tracy McGrady, Clyde Drexler, Sam Jones, Earl Monroe, Reggie Miller, Allen Iverson, Joe Dumars and George Gervin.

[[Jump shot (basketball)]]
CATEGORIES: Basketball terminology, Basketball strategy

In basketball (and derivatives like netball), a jump shot or jumper is an attempt to score a basket by jumping, usually straight up, and in mid-jump, propelling the ball in an arc into the basket. It is accomplished by the player bringing his or her elbow up until it is aligned with the hoop, then sent towards the hoop in a high arc. It is considered the easiest shot to make from a distance. The purposes of the jump are to shoot from a higher position and therefore make it more difficult for the defender to block. It is the most effective in open play but can prove to be hard when there is a taller player in front of the shooter. There also exists another variant of a jump shot by shooting during the upwards movement of the jump to put more power behind the shot, this shot is usually done by women or players lacking enough force to allow far distance shots. This shot has other advantages like a quicker release and therefore a faster execution time (comparable to the set-shot) and several disadvantages like a lower shooting height and less time for the shooter to aim in comparison to the mid-air jump shot. 
Debate still continues as to who invented the jump shot. In his book The Origins of the Jump Shot, author John Christgau makes a strong case that it was Ken Sailors in May 1934. Sailors went on to play for the University of Wyoming and was selected as MVP of their 1943 NCAA Championship team. Sailors also played for five different teams in the old American Basketball League. Other people that Christgau credits with the jump shot are Glen "Glenn" Roberts,  Myer "Whitey" Skoog, John "Mouse" Gonzales, Bud Palmer, Davage "Dave" Minor, “Jumping” Joe Fulks, Johnny Adams, and Belus Smawley.
In the NCAA collegiate archives, John Miller Cooper, who played at the University of Missouri in the 1930s, is recognized as the person to hoist the first jump shot.[tpl]citation |last=Pennington |first=Bill |title=In Search of the First Jump Shot | newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 2002 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/sports/basketball/03jumper.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0[/tpl] 
Today, the jump shot has many varieties, such as the "turnaround jumper" (facing away from the basket, then jumping and spinning towards it, shooting the ball in mid-air); the "fadeaway" (jumping away from the basket to create space); and the "leaning jumper" (jumping towards the basket to move away from a trailing defender). Many however, have overlooked the "hook shot" as a type of jump shot (the offensive player, usually turned perpendicular to the basket, gently throws the ball with a sweeping motion of his arm in an upward arc with a follow-through which ends over his head). It is an art mastered by very few, but for those who have, instituted a lasting impact on the game  today.
Because a defender often has to jump to block a jump shot, an offensive player can try to get his defender in the air at the wrong time by using a pump fake. If the offensive player then jumps into the defender, it is a defensive foul on the defensive player.

[[Community Telegraph]]

CATEGORIES: Independent News & Media, Media in Belfast, Newspapers published in Northern Ireland

The Community Telegraph is a free distribution newspaper published by Independent News & Media.
The newspaper, a sister paper of the paid-for title, The Belfast Telegraph, was created in order to replace its direct predecessor, the now defunct Herald and Post[tpl]dn|date=December 2012[/tpl], also a freesheet.
The Community Telegraph is distributed weekly in four editions throughout north, south, east Belfast and County Down, Northern Ireland. Its paid-for competitors are the North Belfast News and South Belfast News from the Andersonstown News group, and the Bangor Spectator and Newtownards Chronicle.
In April 2007 the paper was relaunched as The CT and in June that year a website was launched.
The way the paper is produced is extremely unusual in the newspaper industry. One journalist is assigned to each edition and is responsible for all aspects of editorial production - writing stories, taking photographs, designing pages and publishing on the internet.
Leading UK media commentator Roy Greenslade has highlighted the model as one which other newspapers may adopt due to the potential for huge cost savings.
The Community Telegraph (and its four editions) was closed in December 2013, with INM describing the titles as "no longer sustainable" in light of falling print advertising revenues.

[[Endothelial microparticle]]
CATEGORIES: Organelles

Endothelial microparticles are small vesicles that are released from endothelial cells and can be found circulating in the blood. The microparticle consists of a plasma membrane surrounding a small amount of cytosol. The membrane of the endothelial microparticle contains receptors and other cell surface molecules which enable the identification of the endothelial origin of the microparticle, and allow it to be distinguished from microparticles from other cells, such as platelets.
Although circulating endothelial microparticles can be found in the blood of normal individuals, increased numbers of circulating endothelial microparticles have been identified in individuals with certain diseases, including hypertension and cardiovascular disorders, and pre-eclampsia [tpl]cite journal | author = Ling L | title = Evaluation of plasma endothelial microparticles in pre-eclampsia. | journal = J Int Med Res | volume = 42 | issue = 1|date=Feb 2014 | pmid = 24319051 | url =  http://imr.sagepub.com/content/42/1/42.full.pdf+html | pages = 42-51[/tpl] and various forms of vasculitis.  The endothelial microparticles in some of these disease states have been shown to have arrays of cell surface molecules reflecting a state of endothelial dysfunction.  Therefore, endothelial microparticles may be useful as an indicator or index of the functional state of the endothelium in disease, and may potentially play key roles in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

[[Small forward]]

CATEGORIES: Basketball positions, Small forwards

The small forward, colloquially known as the three, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game and is commonly abbreviated "SF".  Small forwards are typically somewhat shorter, quicker, and leaner than power forwards and centers, but on occasion are just as tall. The small forward position is considered to be perhaps the most versatile of the five main basketball positions.[tpl]cite news|last=Recruiting Nation|title=Versatility is key for small forwards|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/news/story?id=2677310|newspaper=ESPN|date=November 28, 2006[/tpl] Current NBA small forwards vary in height between 6' 6" and 6' 10" (1.98–2.08 m). The typical placement for a small forward would be between the key and three-point line. 
Small forwards are primarily responsible for scoring points and also often as secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center, although a few, such as Paul Pierce and LeBron James, who play as point forwards have considerable passing responsibilities. Many small forwards in professional basketball, however, are prolific scorers. The styles with which small forwards amass their points vary widely, as some players at the position like the  Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant are very accurate straight up shooters, while others like the New York Knicks' Metta World Peace (formerly Ron Artest) prefer to "bang inside", initiate and/or not shy away from physical contact with opposing players, while others are primarily slashers such as Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James who also possess jumpshots. One common thread among all kinds of small forwards is an ability to "get to the line", that is, having opposing players called for committing shooting fouls against them, as fouls are frequently called on the defense when offensive players "take the ball hard" to the basket; that is, the offensive players aggressively attempt post-up plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. Therefore, accurate foul shooting is an imperative skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points at the foul line.
Defense is often a major priority for small forwards, who are often counted on to use their athleticism and size as defensive advantages. Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs,  Grant Hill of the  Los Angeles Clippers (since retired), Shawn Marion of the Dallas Mavericks, Andrei Kirilenko of the Brooklyn Nets, Luol Deng of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Jimmy Butler of the Chicago Bulls, Tayshaun Prince of the Memphis Grizzlies  and Trevor Ariza of the Washington Wizards, with their height and athleticism, are able to guard at many positions on the floor and are often called upon to do so. Former small forwards known for their defensive abilities include John Havlicek, Scottie Pippen, Bruce Bowen and Michael Cooper, all of whom were staples on the NBA All-Defensive Team.

Jarlsberg was a former countship that forms a part of today’s Vestfold county in Norway. The former countships of Jarlsberg and Larvik were merged into a county in 1821. Jarlsberg and Larvik’s County (Jarlsberg og Larviks amt) were renamed Vestfold in 1919.Store norske leksikon: Jarlsberg og Larviks amt
Created in 1673 as Griffenfeldt Countship (Griffenfeld grevskap), it was after a few years known as Tønsberg Countship (Tønsberg grevskap) until 1684, when the name became Jarlsberg. Dating to 1681, the countship was associated with members of the Dano-Norwegian noble family, Wedel-Jarlsberg.Store norske leksikon: Jarlsberg
Jarlsberg was originally created as a countship in 1673 for Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld, a Danish statesman and Chancellor of Denmark during the reign of King Christian V of Denmark. The creation involved that Count Griffenfeld, in addition to owning 14 percent of the countship’s land, received large tax revenues and also the right to appoint all civil and ecclesiastical officials, including officers and judges, who would serve within the countship.Store norske leksikon: Peder, greve Griffenfeld 
After Griffenfeld’s arrest in 1676 in the aftermath of the Scanian War, his properties were transferred by King Christian V to Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve, the Count of Larvik. Gyldenløve, an illegitimate son King Frederick III of Denmark, was the Viceroy (Statholder) of Norway.Dansk biografisk Lexikon: Biography of Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve 
In 1683, Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve sold the countship to Gustav Frederik Wilhelm Wedel (1641–1717). Field Marshal Wedel, who had become commanding General in Norway in 1681, received the title  Wedel af Jarlsberg in 1684 and introduced the name Jarlsberg, which means ‘Earl’s Hill’.Store norske leksikon: Wedel Jarlsberg

[[Canción]]

CATEGORIES: Cuban music history, Cuban styles of music, Song forms

Canción ("song") is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate.Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p42 Its roots lie in Spanish popular song forms, including tiranas, polos and boleros; also in Italian light operetta, French romanza, and the slow waltz. Initially, even when written by the creole population of Cuba, who opposed the ruling hierarchy, the music retained its European style of "intricate melodies, and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics" (Orovio). 
Later, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the canción came under the influence of the trovador movement. This resulted in the lyrical expression of the feelings and aspirations of the population. The accompaniment of the guitar followed naturally, and the canción gradually fused with other forms of Cuban (and therefore Latin American) music such as the bolero. Leon, Argeliers 1964. Musica folklorica cubana. Biblioteca Nacional Jose Marti, La Habana. p185 As a distinguishing mark, though, the canción never has the full-blooded Afro-Cuban percussion which marks so much Cuban popular music.
"Canción" means song in Spanish. In the Renaissance, the term was often used interchangeably with cantiga, cantar, canson, and sometimes villancico; it was related to the chanson of the Franco-Flemish school. Canción was the least specific term to cover all the popular, secular styles of vocal music of Spain at the time. In Spanish-language concerts and recordings, when the title of a particular song does not belong to a danceable genre (such as son in Cuba, or chacarera in Argentina, its genre is mentioned as "canción".

[[Church service]]
CATEGORIES: Christian worship practices, Prayer, Religious behaviour and experience, Christian terms

In Christianity, a church service is a formalized period of communal worship, often but not exclusively occurring on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism.  The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the "Word of God" (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the "church" in "church service" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which it takes place.
Styles of service vary greatly, from the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Lutheran traditions of liturgical worship to the evangelical Protestant style, that often combines worship with teaching for the believers, which may also have an evangelistic component appealing to the non-Christians and/or skeptics in the congregation. Quakers and some other groups have no formal outline to their services, but allow the worship to develop as the participants present feel moved.

The Cuba was a steamship owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Originally launched in 1897 as the German SS Coblenz, she was seized by the United States in 1917, and named SS Sachem, until Pacific Mail purchased her from the Shipping Board on 6 February 1920 for US$400,000 and renamed SS Cuba.
Pacific Mail first used the Cuba to carry passengers and cargo between San Francisco, California, and Havana, Cuba, then shifted to a San Francisco-to-Cristobal route.
On the morning of 8 September 1923, Cuba struck a reef just off San Miguel Island in the Santa Barbara Channel off Point Arguello and the coast of Santa Barbara County, California.  All aboard survived and were rescued, but the Cuba was a total loss.  
The ship's radio was out.  She had been navigating through a dense fog for several days.

General epistles (also called Catholic Epistles) are books in the New Testament in the form of letters. They are termed "general" because for the most part their intended audience seems to be Christians in general rather than individual persons or congregations as is the case with the Pauline epistles. However, 2 John and 3 John are included in this group despite their addresses respectively to the "elect lady", speculated by many to be the church itself, and to "Gaius", about whom there has been much speculation but little in the way of conclusive proof as to his identity.
There has been some speculation as to the authorship of these works. Many scholars believe 2 Peter to be a pseudepigraphal work.
The epistles of James and Jude are traditionally attributed to Jesus' brothers James and Jude.

Osvaldo Pedro Pugliese (Buenos Aires, December 2, 1905 – July 25, 1995) was an Argentine tango musician. He developed dramatic arrangements that retained strong elements of the walking beat of salon tango but also heralded the development of concert-style tango music.
Some of his music, mostly since the 50s, is used for theatrical dance performances. In Buenos Aires, Pugliese is often played later in the evening when the dancers want to dance more slowly, impressionistically and intimately.
Pugliese is a great choice for slower tango dance music, but the arrangements can be a bit more rhythmically challenging than those played by other orchestras.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] 'Recuerdo' (1924) and 'La yumba' (1946) are two of Pugliese's most popular tangos.
Pugliese was outspoken in his political opinions. His communist sympathies, though never violent, at times earned him the hostility of those in power. Populist President Juan Perón is said to have had labor union heavies once intimidate Pugliese by locking him in a sinking boat, rescuing him at the last minute; though the alleged 1949 incident has never been proven (Pugliese, likewise, seldom spoke of it publicly), the day Pres. Perón awarded the great pianist the Order of May (Argentina's highest civilian award), he embraced Pugliese, saying: "Thank you, maestro, for forgiving".Clarín, 26 July 1995.

Juan d'Arienzo (December 14, 1900 – January 14, 1976) was an Argentine tango musician, also known as "El Rey del Compás" (King of the Beat). He was son of Italian immigrants and used more modern arrangements and instrumentation; his popular group produced hundreds of recordings.
His music is played often at milongas in Buenos Aires, and the instrumentals are the classic harder rhythmic tangos with a strong staccato dance rhythm.  He also recorded many great milongas and fast valses.
His recordings were accompanied by singers such as Alberto Echagüe, Armando Laborde, and Héctor Maure, among others.
Upon his death in 1976, his body was interred in the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Francisco Canaro (November 26, 1888 – December 14, 1964) was an Uruguayan violinist and tango orchestra leader.
His parents, Italians emigrated to Uruguay, and later - when Francisco Canaro was less than 10 years old, they emigrated to Buenos Aires (Argentina) in the late nineteenth century. Canaro was born in San José de Mayo, Uruguay, in 1888. As a young man and found work in a factory, where an empty oil can would, in his skilled hands, become his first violin. Performing in seedy bars initially, he ultimately forged a career that spanned many decades, and his orchestra was one of the most recorded. His introduction to the tango came by orquesta típica leader Vicente Greco in 1908, and in 1912, he composed Pinta brava (Fierce Look). Canaro composed the music for the 1915 Argentine classic, Nobleza gaucha, and later was romantically attached to Argentine actress and tango vocalist Ada Falcón, but the relationship, which began in the early 1920s, grew apart a decade later. 
Canaro was active in the cause of intellectual property rights from 1918 onwards, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Argentine Society of Composers and Songwriters (SADAIC), in 1935, purchasing the downtown Buenos Aires lot where its headquarters were built. He performed in Paris with his orchestra in 1925, and a success among local audiences, he remained in Europe for a decade. Becoming a naturalized Argentine citizen in 1940, much of his recorded music is in the classic salon style of that decade, but he is also considered a member of the old guard, and some of his later recordings contributed to the transition to concert tango. 
His orchestra became a fixture on Argentine radio during the 1940s and early '50s, though for many contemporary dancers and listeners, his early golden age recordings remained the best in their genre. Canaro authored his memoirs, Mis 50 años con el tango (My Fifty Years with the Tango) in 1956, but later developed Paget's disease, and was forced to retire. He died in Buenos Aires in 1964.

Aníbal Carmelo Troilo (July 11, 1914 – May 18, 1975 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine tango musician. 
Troilo was a bandoneon player, composer, arranger and bandleader in Argentina. His orquesta típica was among the most popular with social dancers during the golden age of tango (1940-1955), but he changed to a concert sound by the late 1950s.  
Troilo's orchestra is best known for its instrumentals and also recorded with many vocalists, such as Francisco Fiorentino, Alberto Marino, Floreal Ruiz, Roberto Goyeneche, Raul Beron, and Edmundo Rivero. The rhythmic instrumentals and the recordings with vocalist Francisco Fiorentino from 1940-41 are the favorite recordings for social dancing in contemporary tango salons (milongas). The renowned bandoneonist Astor Piazzolla played in and arranged for his orquesta típica during the period 1939-1944.

[[Perpetual virginity of Mary]]
CATEGORIES: Marian dogmas, Anglican theology and doctrine, Catholic theology and doctrine, Lutheran theology, Non-sexuality, Eastern Orthodox theology, Christian terms, Sexuality in Christianity

The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary expresses the Virgin Mary's "real and perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to Jesus the Son of God made Man". According to the doctrine, Mary was ever-virgin ([tpl]lang-grc-gre|ἀειπάρθενος|aeiparthenos[/tpl]) for the whole of her life, making Jesus her only biological son, whose conception and birth are held to be miraculous.
By the fourth century, the doctrine was widely supported by the Church Fathers, and by the seventh century it had been affirmed in a number of ecumenical councils. The doctrine is part of the teaching of Catholicism and Anglo-Catholics, as well as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, as expressed in their liturgies, in which they repeatedly refer to Mary as "ever virgin".Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 ISBN 0-87779-044-2 page 1134Catechism of the Catholic Church §499Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom, Coptic Liturgy of St Basil, Liturgy of St Cyril, Liturgy of St James, Understanding the Orthodox Liturgy etc.
Some early Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther supported the doctrine, and founding figures of Anglicanism such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer "followed the tradition that they had inherited by accepting Mary as 'ever virgin'" Timothy Bradshaw, "Commentary and Study Guide on the Seattle Statement Mary: Hope and Grace in Christ of the Anglican – Roman Catholic International Commission"). However, later Reformed teaching largely abandoned it. The doctrine of perpetual virginity is, however, currently maintained by some Anglican and Lutheran theologians.Jackson, Gregory Lee, Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison. 1993 ISBN 978-0-615-16635-3 page 254Richard R.

[[Democratic globalization]]
CATEGORIES: Global politics

Democratic globalization is a social movement towards an institutional system of global democracy that would give world citizens a say in world organizations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological NGOs, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held.  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire world.
These proponents state that democratic globalization's purpose is to:
Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the 'anti-globalization' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement) in his work Age of Consent has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

[[Culmer White]]
CATEGORIES: Lifeboats

The Culmer White was a 19th-century lifeboat of the Isle of Thanet.
With the resounding success of the 'Mary White' in 1851 and the subsequent presentation of the 'Culmer White' in 1853 soon afterward, both the Coastguard and the R.N.L.I. were equipping their stations with White's boats. From these humble origins and a developing reputation, White's boatyard grew to become John Samuel Whites of Cowes. A flourishing tradition developed which lasted well into the 1960s with 134 White's lifeboats being ordered, completed and delivered.
White's patented lifeboats featured a "double skin of planking with waterproof material in between", on the whole "a fine example of skillful craftsmanship" - regrettably however they would not 'self-right'.
Ironically, John White declared, a lifeboat "has no reason to capsize at all and there is no reason why she should".
The first of these cost some £116/~; it was sent to Cardigan, on the Welsh coast. Following Thomas White's lead, the first Ramsgate lifeboat was installed in 1852. This was to be called 'The Northumberland', and built by James Beeching for the Ramsgate Harbour Commission.
It was not until 1857 that Walmer at Deal received its first official lifeboat, from the Royal Thames Yacht Club. All of these preceded the RNLI craft that are now such a familiar part of coastal heritage. It is clear from the many boats given over to the service of rescue just how dangerous an area of the coast the Goodwin Sands were considered to be.
The Culmer White achieved everlasting renown amongst historians of the lifeboat service in 1857 with its sister boat on the occasion of the rescue of the Northern Belle.

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is the governing body of association football in Asia. It has 47 member countries, mostly located on the Asian continent. All the transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia are members of UEFA (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey). Israel is also a UEFA member even though it lies entirely in Asia. 
On the other hand, Australia, formerly in the OFC, has been in the AFC since 2006, and the Oceanian island of Guam, a territory of the United States, is also a member of AFC.
One of FIFA's six continental confederations, the AFC was formed officially on 8 May 1954 in Manila, Philippines, on the sidelines of the second Asian Games. The 12 founder members were Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea Republic, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/about-afc |title=About AFC |work=The-AFC.com |publisher=Asian Football Confederation |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] The main headquarters is located in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Robert Hiltzik is best known for being the director of the 1983 summer camp slasher film Sleepaway Camp, which garnered a cult following.  
Hiltzik graduated from Williams College and continued to NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for film and then attended Hofstra University Law School. He now works as a partner in a New York City law firm. 
Hiltzik had no idea that his Sleepaway Camp had gained such a devoted following over the years until he was contacted in March 2000 by Sleepawaycampmovies.com's Jeff Hayes who then arranged for him to record a commentary for the Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD. After a number of sequels directed and written by others, Hiltzik returned in 2004 to write and direct the sequel, Return to Sleepaway Camp. He decided that this newest chapter would ignore the storylines of the other sequels, stating that he wanted to pick up from where the original film had ended. The production was halted for quite some time (according to Fangoria.com, the digital effects were being redone) before finally being released in 2008 as a direct-to-video sequel. As of September 2011, Hiltzik has directed only these two films; he is currently directing another sequel, Sleepaway Camp Reunion.The Internet Movie Database entry for Sleepaway Camp Reunion

CAF represents the national football associations of Africa, runs continental, national, and club competitions, and controls the prize money, regulations and media rights to those competitions.
CAF is one of the biggest of six continental confederations of FIFA. Although it is just three years younger than the UEFA, CAF still has a long way to go in order to improve the quality of the national and local competitions. CAF has been given 5 slots out of the 32 available since the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, this increased to 6 in 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, to include the hosts. The number of places returned to 5 for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
CAF was founded on 8 February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan  by the Egyptian, Ethiopian, South African and Sudanese FAs, following former discussions between the Egyptian, Somali, South African and Sudanese FAs earlier in 7 June 1956 in Avenida Hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Its first headquarters was situated in Khartoum, Sudan for some months until a fire outbreak in the offices of the Sudanese Football Association when the organization moved near Cairo. Youssef Mohammad was the first General Secretary and Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem the president. The administrative center since 2002 is located in 6th of October City, near Cairo. It was initially made up of 4 national associations. Currently there are 56 associations, 54 full members beside Zanzibar[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] and Réunion Island as associates.

Northern Belle 
was an American transatlantic ship which ran aground near Thanet, England on January 5, 1857.  No lives were lost, thanks to heroic rescue efforts, in blizzard conditions. However, another ship sank en route to the scene, the Margate lugger "Victory" was lost with a crew of 9.
The Northern Belle set out from New York, crossing the Atlantic, only to run into trouble at Thanet, so close to its destination of London.  At 3 am, on a bitter-cold morning, it became apparent that a ship was in some peril in local waters near the little harbour of Broadstairs. 
The ship had been cast ashore on a dangerous ledge of rocks below the Foreness Point, at Kingsgate, between Broadstairs and the coast of Margate. On seeing the plight of the Northern Belle's crew, the Coastguard had sent warning to Broadstairs, and so, despite the severe conditions prevailing, the Mary White and Culmer White lifeboats were hauled overland by horse-drawn trailer, against the blizzard, to a point where they could be safely launched.

Don MacLaughlin (November 24, 1906 – May 28, 1986) was an American soap opera actor.
He was born on November 24, 1906, in Webster, Iowa, under the name William Donald McLaughlin.
He originated the role of lawyer Chris Hughes on As the World Turns in 1956, and played the role until his death in 1986. Contract negotiations kept him (and his on-screen wife Helen Wagner) off the soap for most of the early 1980s, but the show finally welcomed the two back in a big storyline with heavy uses of past clips from the show: in the story, Chris and his wife Nancy were celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. In real life, As the World Turns was celebrating its thirtieth anniversary on the air.
Prior to TV, MacLaughlin starred as the title character on radio's David Harding, Counterspy in the 1940s and 50s. Old time radio sites have broadcasts available.  He appeared in a 1948 Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's play The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden.Don MacLaughlin at the Internet Broadway Database

[[Solar System model]]

CATEGORIES: Physics education, Scale modeling, Solar System models

Solar System models, especially mechanical models, called orreries, that illustrate the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons in the Solar System have been built for centuries. While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a scale model of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the Earth and the Sun is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.
If the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance. The objects in such models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move and some used clockworks to make the relative speeds of objects accurate. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time instead of distance.

Lincoln's Inn Fields is the largest public square in London.

I (The Buildings of England), (1957) 1962:55. The original plan for "laying out and planting" these fields, drawn by the hand of Inigo Jones, was said still to be seen in Lord Pembroke's collection at Wilton House in the 19th century,'Lincoln's Inn Fields', Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 44-50. date accessed: 16 July 2010. but is untraced.It is not mentioned in the modern literature on Inigo Jones. The grounds, which had remained private property, were acquired by London County Council in 1895. It is today managed by the London Borough of Camden and forms part of the southern boundary of that borough with the City of Westminster.
Lincoln's Inn Fields takes its name from the adjacent Lincoln's Inn, of which the private gardens are separated from the Fields by a perimeter wall and a large gatehouse.
The grassed area in the centre of the Fields contains a court for tennis and netball and a bandstand. It was previously used for corporate events, but these are no longer permitted. Cricket and other sports are thought to have been played here in the 18th century.

The tuberoinfundibular pathway refers to a population of dopamine neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the mediobasal hypothalamus (the 'tuberal region') that project to the median eminence (the 'infundibular region'). It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. Dopamine released at this site regulates the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland.
Some antipsychotic drugs block dopamine in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can cause an increase in blood prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia). This can cause abnormal lactation (even in men), disruptions to the menstrual cycle in women, visual problems, headache and sexual dysfunction.

[[Euclid and his Modern Rivals]]

CATEGORIES: 1879 books, Mathematics books, Works by Lewis Carroll, 1879 in science

Euclid and his Modern Rivals is a mathematical book published in 1879 by the English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898), better known as Lewis Carroll. It considers the pedagogic merit of thirteen contemporary geometry textbooks, demonstrating how each in turn is either inferior to or functionally identical to that of Euclid's Elements.
In it Dodgson supports using Euclid's geometry textbook The Elements as the geometry textbook in schools against more modern geometry textbooks that were replacing it. Euclid's ghost returns in the play to defend his book against its modern rivals and tries to demonstrate how all of them are inferior to his book.
Despite its scholarly subject and content, the work takes the form of a whimsical dialogue, principally between a mathematician named Minos (taken from Minos, judge of the underworld in Greek mythology) and a "devil's advocate" named Professor Niemand (German for 'nobody') who represents the "Modern Rivals" of the title.

Marine Drive is a 4.3-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. A promenade lies parallel to this road. In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid.[tpl]cite news |title=Marine Drive will be smoother ride soon |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_marine-drive-will-be-smoother-ride-soon_1754833 |first=Eknath|last=Makne |date=October 22, 2012|agency=Daily News and Analysis|location=Mumbai|accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl]
The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. It was earlier known as Sonapur to local Marathi people. The highlight of Marine Drive is the beautiful promenade along the road where many of its residents take in a breath of fresh air and view the setting sun. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighbourhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra.
Most of the buildings which were built by wealthy Parsis sport an art deco look that was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Miami in the United States is the only city in the world that has more art deco buildings along the seafront than Mumbai.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Real estate prices along the esplanade are high. A lot of celebrities live here, making it one of India's premier residential community. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early 2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of the city.
Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because if viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls,forming a necklace. It is also the world's largest viewing gallery[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] and hence has been a host to a number of events that take place along the promenade. It is the major attraction in Mumbai city. It is a tourist place.

[[Aubrey holes]]

CATEGORIES: Stonehenge, Chalk pits

The Aubrey holes are a ring of fifty-six (56) Chalk pits at Stonehenge named after the seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey. They date to the earliest phases of Stonehenge in the late fourth and early third millennium BC. Despite decades of argument and analysis, their purpose is still unknown although an astronomical role has often been suggested.
Whilst visiting the monument in 1666, Aubrey noticed five circular cavities in the ground and noted them in his records. These features were ignored or not seen by the later antiquarians to investigate the site, and it was not until the 1920s during the work carried out by Colonel William Hawley that Hawley's assistant Robert Newall identified a ring of pits he named in honour of Aubrey and his early survey.
The depressions seen by Aubrey himself are more likely to have been different features from those that now bear his name. Mike Pitts in a 1981 article in Nature pointed out that the holes had been backfilled thousands of years before Aubrey visited the site.Pitts, M. W. (5 March 1981). "Stones, Pits and Stonehenge". Nature 290: 46–47. The presence of later cremation burials and sarsen stone chips in the holes' upper fills supports this. That none of the other antiquarians who visited the site noticed any such holes implies that they were not permanent features either. Pitts argues that they were more likely to be the cavities left by features that had recently been removed. He has suggested that perhaps further megaliths stood at Stonehenge which occupied these other holes and are now lost.

Caribbean hermit crabs are both herbivorous and scavengers. In the wild, C. clypeatus feeds on animal and plant remains, overripe fruit, and feces of other animals, including the Mona ground iguana, Cyclura stejnegeri. The West Indian top snail (Cittarium pica) shell is often used for its home, and the hermit crab can use its larger claw to cover the aperture of the shell for protection against predators. Typically, the Caribbean hermit crab's left claw is larger in size than its right claw and is purple in color. Female land hermit crabs release fertilized eggs into the ocean. The spawning (called "washing" in the English-speaking Caribbean) occurs on certain nights, usually around August.[tpl]cite journal|author=Ángel M. Nieves-Rivera & Ernest H.

On the offensive line, Brown pass blocked for quarterbacks Charlie Conerly and Y. A. Tittle and run blocked for backs like Alex Webster and Frank Gifford.  Despite his 6'3", 255-pound frame, Brown was very quick on his feet which was very unusual for his era.  He is considered one of the greatest "sleeper picks" in NFL history as he was drafted in 27th round of the NFL Draft.giants.com, Hall of Famers 1975-present, accessed January 12, 2007
Brown was named to the Pro Bowl a total of nine times and helped the Giants win the NFL Championship in 1956.
Following the 1965 season, Brown retired, suffering from chronic phlebitis.  He became the Giants' assistant offensive line coach in 1966 and was promoted to offensive line coach in 1969.  He remained with the Giants organization in the scouting department for many years.
In 1999, he was ranked number 57 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.

CATEGORIES: 20th-century mathematicians, Living people, University of Toronto alumni, 1930 births

Norman W. Johnson (born November 12, 1930) is a mathematician, previously at Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts.  He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in 1966 with a dissertation title of The Theory of Uniform Polytopes and Honeycombs under the supervision of  H. S. M. Coxeter.
In his 1966 doctoral thesis Johnson discovered three uniform antiprism-like star polytopes named the Johnson antiprisms. Their bases are the three ditrigonal polyhedra – the small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron, ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron and the great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron.
In 1966 he enumerated 92 convex non-uniform polyhedra with regular faces.  Victor Zalgaller later proved (1969) that Johnson's list was complete, and the set is now known as the Johnson solids.
More recently, Johnson has participated in the Uniform Polychora Project, an effort to find and name higher-dimensional polytopes.http://www.mit.edu/~hlb/Associahedron/program.pdf CONVEX AND ABSTRACT POLYTOPES Workshop (2005), N.Johnson — Uniform Polychora abstract

[[Peter Hobson]]
CATEGORIES: Academics of the University of London, British psychologists, Living people

R. P. Hobson, or Peter Hobson, is a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at University College London known for his work on autism and experimental child psychology. His research leads him to conclusions concerning the origins of consciousness, summarized in a book for the general reader, The Cradle of Thought. 
The core of his analysis is that human minds are the outcome of a successful series of interactions between infant and caregiver(s). In this Hobson's research has built on foundations established by Colwyn Trevarthen from the mid-1970s onwards. Trevarthen identified distinct steps in pre-lingual infant development, Primary Intersubjectivity and Secondary Intersubjectivity, which endow the infant's developing mind/brain with the architecture necessary for the achievement of symbolic thought.
Hobson throws further light on this basic claim by examining what occurs in cases where, for genetic or environmental reasons, infants are denied the opportunity to investigate intersubjective relationships. To achieve a rare vantage point on human development without unethical experimentation, Hobson examines cases of autism, Down's syndrome, congenital blindness and extreme social deprivation (for which statistically significant numbers of orphans rescued from Nicolae Ceauşescu's Romanian orphanages were available). The obstacles each of these circumstances placed in the way of normal infant-caregiver interaction are finely examined.
Hobson's argument constitutes a challenge to certain flavors of sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology, in that it traces the conception of the human mind back to a 'cradle' of social interactions, without which consciousness in the full, human sense is unobtainable. On the other hand, Hobson demonstrates that a hard-wired emotional connection is crucial for an infant to start the process of intersubjective learning. The experience of having an emotion elicited by another human being, and eliciting emotional responses in others, is identified as the material out of which humans fashion their sense of self, other, object and symbol.
Hobson's thesis is of growing interest in Philosophy of Mind and related disciplines. Edward Skidelsky suggests that Hobson fatally overlooks the fact that people with autism learn to speak (see External Links, below). Others have understood Hobson to be blaming parents for autism, a charge explicitly rejected in The Cradle of Thought.

Caspar Bartholin the Elder (12 February 1585 – 13 July 1629) was born at Malmø, Denmark (modern Sweden) and was a polymath, finally accepting a professorship in medicine at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1613. He later taught theology at the same university.
His precocity was extraordinary; at three years of age he was able to read, and in his thirteenth year he composed Greek and Latin orations and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen he went to the University of Copenhagen and afterwards studied at Rostock and Wittenberg.
He then travelled through Germany, the Netherlands, England, France and Italy, and was received with marked respect at the different universities he visited. In 1613 he was chosen professor of medicine in the University of Copenhagen, and filled that office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow that if he should recover he would apply himself solely to the study of divinity. He fulfilled his vow by becoming professor of divinity at Copenhagen and canon of Roskilde. He died on the 13th of July 1629 at Sorø in Zealand.
His work, Anatomicae Institutiones Corporis Humani (1611) was for many years a standard textbook on the subject of anatomy.  He was the first to describe the workings of the olfactory nerve.
Of his sons, two, Thomas and Erasmus, were also noted scholars.

[[Ptolemy (gnostic)]]

CATEGORIES: Gnostics, 2nd-century people

Ptolemy the Gnostic, or Ptolemaeus Gnosticus, was a disciple of the Gnostic teacher Valentinius and is known to us for an epistle he wrote to a wealthy woman named Flora, herself not a gnostic[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl].
Ptolemy was probably still alive c. 180. No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack's suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by St. Justin is as yet unproved.Text. u. Untersuch. New. Ser. XIII, Anal. z. ält. Gesch. d. Chr.  It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of Valentinius, but Valentinius was active in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and in Rome. Ptolemy was, with Heracleon, the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Rome, Italy, and Southern Gaul.
Ptolemy's works have reached us in an incomplete form as follows: 
The latter is found in the works of Epiphanius.Hær. XXXIII, 3-7 It was written in response to Flora's inquiry concerning the origin of the Law of the Old Testament. The Decalogue, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme God, nor to the devil; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law-giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic demiurge; the second part is attributable to Moses, and the third part to the elders of the Jewish people. In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections: 

This part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as circumcision and fasting and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane. The god who is the author of the law, insofar as it is not the product of human effort, is the demiurge who occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil. He is the creator of the material universe, is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called 'just' and benevolent to the extent of his abilities. 
In his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred to an extensive system of aeons that emanated from a monadic spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the pleroma. This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma based on the prologue of John's gospel.

[[Kid Flash]]

CATEGORIES: Comic book sidekicks

Kid Flash is the name of several fictional characters appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, originally created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, as a junior counterpart to DC Comics superhero The Flash. The first incarnation of the character, Wally West, debuted in The Flash (vol. 1) #110 (1959). The character, along with others like the first Wonder Girl, Aqualad, and Speedy, was created in response to the success of Batman's young sidekick Robin. These young heroes would later be spun off into their own superhero team, the Teen Titans. As Kid Flash, Wally West made regular appearances in Flash related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1959 through the mid-1980s until the character was reinvented as the new version of The Flash.
Later, well after Wally West had made a name for himself as the new Flash, the character of Bart Allen, grandson of legendary Flash Barry Allen, was brought into the past from his home in the future and served as the young hero Impulse. In 2003, with writer Geoff Johns' relaunch of a new Teen Titans volume, Bart donned the mantle of Kid Flash after being nearly killed by the assassin Deathstroke. As Kid Flash, Bart appeared in Teen Titans and The Flash (vol. 2) regularly until the Infinite Crisis event, where a disappearance of Wally West made Bart the fourth Flash. Apparently killed by the Rogues, Bart was resurrected in the 31st century by Legion of Super-Heroes member Brainiac 5 and retook the mantle of Kid Flash.

George Mathews ([tpl]OldStyleDateDY|August 30, |1739|August 19, 1739[/tpl] – [tpl]nowrap|August 30, 1812[/tpl]) was a Continental Army officer during the American Revolution and afterward a United States general officer; he was 20th and 21st governor of Georgia, and a U.S. Congressman. He was the main U.S. participant in the Patriot War of East Florida, an 1810-1812 filibuster expedition to capture Spanish Florida for the United States.
Born in Augusta County, Virginia, Mathews was in early life a merchant and planter. He quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces, and was credited along with Colonel Andrew Lewis for the victory of the Virginia provincial militia against the Shawnee and Mingo Indian tribes in the Battle of Point Pleasant of Dunmore's War. He was afterward a member of the House of Burgesses from Augusta County. He attended the First Virginia Convention when the Virginia General Assembly was dissolved by Royal Governor Lord Dunmore.
On the outbreak of the American Revolution Mathews led the 9th Virginia Infantry of the Continental Army to the Battle of Brandywine. He has been called "the hero of Brandywine" for his efforts during the American defeat. Mathews and his entire regiment were captured in the Battle of Germantown the following month. He spent the next four years as a prisoner of war, including two years on the British prison ship HMS Jersey. After the war, he moved to the state of Georgia and was quickly elected to the Georgia General Assembly. The same year he was elected 20th governor of the state. He served two terms as governor, and one intermittent term in Congress, during which he voted to ratify the United States Constitution. During his second administration he quietly allowed the creation of the rogue state of the Trans-Oconee Republic, headed by General Elijah Clarke. He oversaw the removal of the state when public opinion, coupled with pressure from the Federal government, shifted. His administration was later tainted by the Yazoo Land Fraud, which ultimately led to his retiring from politics.
Mathews relocated to the Mississippi Territory and in 1810 was assigned a filibuster operation by President James Madison to incite an insurrection in East Florida and capture the territory for the United States. This initiative is now referred to as the Patriot War of East Florida. Mathews had successfully launched the insurrection, capturing Ferninanda Beach and Amelia Island, before the secret mission was recalled and disowned by President Madison, fearing war with Spain and its allies. On learning of the recall, Mathews set out to Washington DC to confront Madison on the decision. He died in Augusta, Georgia on his way to the capital. He is buried at St. Paul's Episcopal Church.

[[Gaugino]]
CATEGORIES: Supersymmetry, Theoretical physics, Hypothetical elementary particles

In particle physics, a gaugino is the hypothetical superpartner of a gauge field, as predicted by gauge theory combined with supersymmetry. They are fermions.
In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model the following gauginos exist:
Gauginos mix with higgsinos, the superpartners of the Higgs field's degrees of freedom, to form linear combinations ("mass eigenstates") called neutralinos (electrically neutral) and charginos (electrically charged). In many models the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), often a neutralino such as the photino, is stable. In that case it is a WIMP and a candidate for dark matter.

[[Caazapá Department]]

CATEGORIES: Caazapá Department

Caazapá ([tpl]IPA-es|kasaˈpa[/tpl]) is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Caazapá. Among Paraguayans, the department is well known for its orange and mandarin trees, and for its forest hills. The eastern part of Caazapa is relatively undeveloped and consists of rolling hills and large swaths of Brazilian Atlantic interior rainforest between the San Rafael mountains to the south and the Yvytyrysy mountains to the north. The Western part is an area of low-lying marshes and swampland area, and consists of wetlands and tributaries to eastern Paraguay's largest river, the Tebicuary. Many indigenous groups make their home in what remains of the rainforest especially south of the unpaved highway between San Juan Nepomuceno and Tavaí. Mby'a and Guayaki people, who practice farming corn, cassava and yerba mate under the canopy of the forest live in small bands and travel mainly by foot. They are technically protected and their land is a national reserve, but illegal loggers, ranchers and more recently, Brazilian soybean growers have encroached upon their territory. With Paraguay's weak legal infrastructure, little can be done by way of enforcement or sanctions.

[[Higgsino]]

CATEGORIES: Supersymmetry, Fermions, Hypothetical elementary particles

In particle physics, a Higgsino, symbol [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]SubatomicParticle|Higgsino[/tpl][/tpl], is the hypothetical superpartner of the Higgs boson, as predicted by supersymmetry.  The Higgsino is a Dirac fermion and that is a weak isodoublet with hypercharge half under the Standard Model gauge symmetries.  After electroweak symmetry breaking the Higgsino becomes a pair of neutral Majorana fermions called neutralinos and a charged Dirac fermion called a chargino (plus and minus). These states finally mix with the neutralinos (photino and zino) and chargino (charged wino plus and minus)resulting from electroweak symmetry breaking of the bino and wino 0, 1, 2 to form the predicted particles which are four neutralinos and two charginos (plus and minus each). Such a linear combination of the Higgsino, bino and wino makes up the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is a particle physics candidate for the dark matter of the universe.  In order to be such a candidate, it must be neutral (i.e. a neutralino rather than chargino).
In natural scenarios of SUSY, top squarks, bottom squarks, gluinos, and higgsino-enriched neutralinos and charginos are expected to be relatively light, enhancing their production cross sections. Higgsino searches have been performed by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where physicists have searched for the direct electroweak pair production of Higgsinos. As of March 2014, no experimental evidence for Higginos has been reported.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults|title=ATLAS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=ATLAS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsSUS|title=CMS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=CMS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]

Daniel Moreau Barringer (May 25, 1860 – November 30, 1929) was a geologist best known as the first person to prove the existence of an impact crater on the Earth, the Meteor Crater in Arizona. The site has been renamed the Barringer Crater in his honor, although this name might mainly be used by the scientific community.
Daniel Barringer, the son of Daniel Moreau Barringer and the nephew of Rufus Barringer, graduated from Princeton University in 1879 at the age of 19, and in 1882 graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's School of Law. He later studied geology and mineralogy at Harvard University and at the University of Virginia, respectively.
In 1892, Barringer, along with his friend Richard A. F. Penrose, Jr., and others, purchased a gold and silver mine near Cochise, Arizona. Later, Barringer also discovered the Commonwealth Silver Mine in Pearce, Arizona. These mining ventures made him a wealthy man.

Deej Fabyc is an Australian/British artist who works with what she calls a "forenzic biographical" type of art, with works in performance, performance installation, combined with drawing, video, photography and objects. Her work takes up the personal is political as read and does not differentiate between art and life. She has exhibited throughout Europe, the United States and Australia since 1982. She lives in London, England, and is the current visiting lecturer in Time Based Media at Sir John Cass Department of Art, Media & Design, London Metropolitan University.
Fabyc's work has been shown internationally in museums, galleries and artist-run spaces for the past 15 years. Her body of work addresses the psychological dimensions of the personal and political experience of trauma, a sense or ambivalence and 'schlock horror' permeates her work. Fabyc is also Founding Director of Elastic Residence in East London.
The name "Fabyc" is an acronym meaning "Family By Choice", and she has used this name since she was nineteen, as it gives her the freedom to make her work without worrying about it reflecting on her family.

[[Fried dough]]

CATEGORIES: American desserts, Deep fried foods, Canadian cuisine

Fried dough is a North American food associated with outdoor food stands in carnivals, amusement parks, fairs, rodeos, and seaside resorts (though it can be made at home).  Fried dough is the specific name for a particular variety of fried bread made of a yeast dough; see the accompanying images for an example of use on carnival-booth signs. Fried dough is also known as fry dough, fry bread, fried bread, doughboys, elephant ears, scones, frying saucers, buñuelos in the case of smaller pieces. These foods are virtually identical to each other, and recognizably different from other fried dough foods such as doughnuts, beignets, or fritters.
In Canada, pieces of fried dough are sometimes called beaver tails.  According to Bill Castleman, a writer of books on Canadian word origins, the name referred to quick-baked dough "especially in early 19th-century places where people might camp for one night and where there was no frying pan."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billcasselman.com/canadian_food_words/cfw_five.htm|title=Canadian Food Words|author=Bill Castleman|accessdate=2006-12-17[/tpl]Russell Frank, Explorations in the Far North University of Iowa, 1898. p. 39. In 1978, Pam & Grant Hooker of Ottawa, Ontario founded the BeaverTails chain of restaurants specializing in the sale of fried dough pastries which are hand stretched to the shape of a beaver's tail.
A smaller Italian variant common in North America is the zeppole.
Similar food is found in Europe, also typically from outdoor stands in fairs. For example, in Croatia fried dough is known as languši, while the oliebol is eaten in the Netherlands.

SDSC is internationally recognized for its contribution to computational biosciences and computational approaches to earth sciences and genomics.  SDSC is especially known for its role in the creation and maintenance of the Protein Data Bank, the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Cyberinfrastructure Center (NEESit), cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences (GEON), and the Tree of Life Project (TOL) .
SDSC is one of the four original sites involved in the TeraGrid project along with National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Argonne National Laboratory, and Center for Advanced Computing Research (CACR).
SDSC developed the Rocks cluster computing environment, and is a pioneer in data management software development, including the storage resource broker (SRB).
Currently, the director of SDSC is Michael L. Norman,  professor of physics at UCSD,  who succeeds Francine Berman, a noted pioneer in grid computing. He was named director in September 2010, having been   interim director for more than a year.
SDSC is home to the Performance Modeling and Characterization (PMaC) laboratory, whose mission is to bring scientific rigor to the prediction and understanding of factors affecting the performance of current and projected High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. PMaC is funded by the Department of Energy (SciDac PERC research grant), the Department of Defense (Navy DSRC PET program), DARPA, and the National Science Foundation. Allan E. Snavely founded the PMaC laboratory in 2001. 
In 2009 a combined team from SDSC and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs led by Allan Snavely won the prestigious Data Challenge competition held in Portland Oregon, at SC09, the annual premier conference in High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis for their design of a new kind of supercomputer that makes extensive use of flash memory and nicknamed "Dash". Dash is a prototype for a much larger system nicknamed "Gordon" that the team will deploy at SDSC in 2011 with more than 256 TB of flash memory.

CATEGORIES: 2004 elections in the United Kingdom, European Parliament election, 2004, European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom

The European Parliament election, 2004 was the UK part of the European Parliament election, 2004. It was held on 10 June. It was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom using postal-only voting in four areas. It coincided with local and London elections.
The Conservative Party and the Labour Party both polled poorly. The Conservatives, although getting a vote share 4.1% greater than Labour, still experienced their lowest vote share in a national election since 1832. Labour's vote share was its lowest since 1918. Labour's decline in votes was regarded as being largely due to widespread public dissatisfaction about the Iraq War and, as with the Conservatives, the increased popularity of the United Kingdom Independence Party.
The United Kingdom Independence Party did exceptionally well, and managed to increase its number of MEPs from 3 to 12, drawing level with the Liberal Democrats, who increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats, and pushing them into fourth place in the overall vote. UKIP received a very large increase in media coverage before the elections, partly because of the appointment of Robert Kilroy-Silk as a candidate. The actress Joan Collins also became a member and announced her support for the party.
Other minor parties also posted vote gains.
In Northern Ireland, as expected, Sinn Féin beat the SDLP in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat. This coincided with its winning a seat in the corresponding elections in the Republic.
Gibraltar voted for the first time, as part of the South West England region. The Conservative Party won overwhelming support there on a higher than average turnout. For full results, see European Parliament Election, 2004 (Gibraltar).

The 1988 Republican National Convention of the Republican Party of the United States was held in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana from August 15 to August 18, 1988. It was the second time that a major party held its convention in one of the five states known as the Deep South, coming on the heels of the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Atlanta, Georgia. Much of the impetus for holding the convention in the Superdome came from the Louisiana Republican National Committeewoman Virginia Martinez of New Orleans, who lobbied on behalf of her adopted home city as the convention site as a member of the RNC Executive Committee.http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/orleans/obits/1/m-07.txt
The convention nominated Vice President George H. W. Bush for President, as expected. The second spot on the ticket was not publicly known before the convention; James Danforth "Dan" Quayle, U.S. Senator of Indiana, was selected as Bush's vice-presidential running mate. The revelation of Quayle's selection as running mate did not come until the second day of the convention, when NBC News broke the story.
The convention featured speeches by Joe Paterno, Pat Robertson, a keynote address by Thomas Kean, then-governor of New Jersey, and the music of the Jimmy Maxwell Orchestra.

[[Persecution and the Art of Writing]]

CATEGORIES: 1952 books, Books in political philosophy, Contemporary philosophical literature, Philosophy essays, Persecution

Persecution and the Art of Writing, published in 1952 by the Free Press, is a book of collected articles written by Leo Strauss. The book contains five previously published essays, many of which were significantly altered by Strauss from their original publication. The general theme of the book is the relationship between politics and philosophy. The thesis of the book is that many ancient and early modern political philosophers, in order to avoid persecution, hid their most heterodox ideas within their texts.
Strauss's general argument—rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in The City and Man – 1978)—is that prior to the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal.  Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo.  In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner.  Their "art of writing" was the art of exoteric communication.  This is all the more apparent in medieval times, when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably intransigent tribunals.  
Strauss's argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many (hoi polloi) and an esoteric/hidden one for the few (hoi aristoi), but that said writers succeeded in conveying meaning proper at the heart of their writings—a heart or message irreducible to "the letter" or historical dimension of texts.  
Explicitly following G.E. Lessing's lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, in writing, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by "the many" (who did not read), but by those "few" whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality: precisely those few righteous personalities would be most inclined to persecute or ostracize anyone who is in the business of exposing the noble or great lie upon which stands or falls the authority of the few over the many.

[[Kaimanawa horse]]
CATEGORIES: Mammals of New Zealand, Horse breeds, Feral horses, Invasive animal species in New Zealand, Horse breeds originating in New Zealand

  
Kaimanawa horses are a population of feral horses in New Zealand that are descended from domestic horses released in the 19th and 20th centuries.  They are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament. The New Zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live, which includes several endangered species of plants. The varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights, body patterns and colours. They are usually well-muscled, sure-footed and tough.
Horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814. The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses, as well as being caught for their meat, hair and hides. The herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges, and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979. The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses in the herd by 1994. A small, mostly unmanaged population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd, removing around 2,800 horses altogether. The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed.

11β-Hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (11β-OH CAH) is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11β-hydroxylase which mediates the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11β-OH CAH results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects. It also causes excessive androgen production both before and after birth and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex.

[[Time-to-digital converter]]

In electronic instrumentation and signal processing, a time to digital converter (abbreviated TDC) is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the time they occurred. For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time.
In electronics time-to-digital converters (TDCs) or time digitizers are devices commonly used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases [tpl]Citation |title=Review of methods for time interval measurements with picosecond resolution |first=Józef |last=Kalisz |journal=Metrologia |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages= 17–32 |date=February 2004 |publisher=Instutute of Physics Publishing |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/41/1/004 [/tpl] interpolating TDCs are also called time counters (TCs).
TDCs are used in many different applications, where the time interval between two signal pulses (start and stop pulse) should be determined. Measurement is started and stopped, when either the rising or the falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. These  requirements are fulfilled in many physical experiments, like time-of-flight and lifetime measurements in atomic and high energy physics, experiments that involve laser ranging and electronic research involving the testing of integrated circuits and high-speed data transfer.

[[Liberal Party of Canada Rat Pack]]
CATEGORIES: Liberal Party of Canada

The Rat Pack was the nickname given to a group of young, high-profile Canadian Liberal opposition Members of Parliament during the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
The Liberal Party had suffered the worst defeat in its history in the 1984 election.  In the first years of the Mulroney government, the Liberals failed to mount an effective opposition to Mulroney, and were in danger of being overshadowed by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which had almost as many seats as the Liberals.
In the midst of this, a group of young, energetic, and unknown Liberals soon emerged as a vocal voice of opposition to Mulroney.  They included Don Boudria of eastern Ontario, Sheila Copps of Hamilton, Brian Tobin of Newfoundland and John Nunziata of the Greater Toronto Area.  Tobin had been elected when the Liberals regained power in the 1980 election; the others had been among the few bright spots for the Liberals in the 1984 blowout.  Except for Nunziata and Boudria, who held some socially conservative views, all of them came from the left wing of the Liberal Party.  Boudria, Tobin, and Copps were all appointed to Cabinet at various times during the ministry of Jean Chretien.
Nunziata was expelled from the Liberal Party in 1996 for voting against the budget.  He then ran—and won—as an independent candidate in the 1997 general election and then was defeated by a Liberal in 2000. Tobin left Parliament in 1996 to become leader of the Newfoundland Liberal Party; he served as that province's premier until returning to Parliament in 2000.
Under the somewhat more right of centre Paul Martin, who succeeded Chrétien in 2003, Copps and Boudria were relegated to the Liberal backbenches. Tobin had already left Parliament in 2002 in protest of the stranglehold on the Liberal organization by Martin's supporters.  In 2004, Copps' riding was merged with that of Martin loyalist Tony Valeri in such a way that most of the new riding's residents lived in Valeri's old riding.  Copps was narrowly defeated for renomination.  The last remaining member of the group, Boudria, did not run for reelection in 2006.

As a result, higher levels of 17OH-pregnenolone appear in the blood with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.
There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations of 3β-HSD CAH, from mild to severe forms. The uncommon severe form results from a complete loss of enzymatic activity and manifests itself in infancy as salt wasting due to the loss of mineralocorticoids. Milder forms resulting from incomplete loss of 3β-HSD type II function do not present with adrenal crisis, but can still produce virilization of genetically female infants and undervirilization of genetically male infants.  As a result, this form of primary hypoadrenalism is the only form of CAH that can cause ambiguous genitalia in both genetic sexes.

The Greek alphabet is the script that has been used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BC.[tpl]sfn|Cook|1987|p=9[/tpl] It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was in turn the ancestor of numerous other European and Middle Eastern scripts, including Cyrillic and Latin.[tpl]sfn|Coulmas|1996|p=[/tpl] Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, both in its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.
In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era.
Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient Greek and Modern Greek usage, owing to phonological changes in the language.
In traditional ("polytonic") Greek orthography, vowel letters can be combined with several diacritics, including accent marks, so-called "breathing" marks, and the iota subscript. In common present-day usage for Modern Greek since the 1980s, this system has been simplified to a so-called "monotonic" convention.

[[United Kingdom local elections, 2004]]

The United Kingdom local elections of 2004 were held on 10 June, as part of the 2004 set of elections along with the European elections and the London mayoral and Assembly elections.
The councils of all the metropolitan boroughs in England and all the principal areas of Wales were all up for re-election, along with many other district and unitary authorities throughout England. No local elections were held in Scotland.
They were the first since the election of Michael Howard to the leadership of the Conservative Party. Howard was looking for a good result in the election to confirm that the Conservatives were back on the road to being able to seriously consider winning the next general election.
Early results confirmed that the Labour Party was having a bad time. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said that, "Iraq was a cloud, or indeed a shadow, over these elections. I am not saying we haven't had a kicking. It's not a great day for Labour".
However the Conservatives were not making many of the gains that would have indicated a complete change of electoral fortune. The national equivalent share of the vote in the election was found by academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher to be 37% to the Conservatives, 27% to the Liberal Democrats and 26% to Labour. For one of the two major parties to come third in local elections was unheard of in the post-1945 period, let alone for a governing party with such a large majority to come third.
Even in the North, Labour's traditional heartland, Labour did not do too well, losing control of Doncaster, Leeds, Newcastle and St Helens.  However, they did pick up several councils, notably Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff from Plaid Cymru in Wales.
Despite an increase in their vote and number of councillors, the Liberal Democrats saw a net loss of councils to NOC. The loss to the Conservatives of Eastbourne was in a single-seat by-election. This was partially offset by victories in Newcastle and Pendle.
The British National Party made a net gain of four seats, and held 14. This left them with a total 21 councillors in the country, including six in Burnley and four in Bradford. In the wards they contested, they averaged 16.1% of the vote.

[[Cider apple]]
CATEGORIES: Apples, Cider

Cider apples are a group of apple cultivars grown for their use in cider production. In the UK the Long Ashton Research Station categorised cider apples in 1903 into four main types according to the nature of their flavour components.http://www.cider.org.uk/appledat.htm  For cider production it is important that the fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. Cider apples therefore often have higher sugar levels than Dessert and Culinary apples.
Normally, ciders are blended using juice from several apple cultivars to give the best results. There are few varieties that will make a good cider all by themselves, Golden Russet is one such variety, and is prized in both single variety and multi-variety blends of cider.
Three apple cultivars from England are 'Kingston Black', 'Stoke Red', and 'Dymock Red':
Famous American cider apple cultivars are Harrison Cider Apple, 'Campfield', Hewe's Virginia Crab,Calhoun, Creighton Lee, Jr, Old Southern Apples, Blacksburg, Virginia, The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company, 1995, page 87 and Yates. The first two originated in Essex County, New Jersey before 1776.[tpl]cite book|last=William Coxe|title=A view of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees and the Management of Orchards and Cider|location=Philadelphia|year=1817[/tpl] The Hewe's was grown from early 1700s and by Thomas Jefferson in his cider orchard.

Snakebite is a popular drink in the United Kingdom where it is made with lager and may be served with a dash of blackcurrant squash, which is referred to as a snakebite and black.http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink2081.html Stout may be used instead of lager when the drink is served in the United States.
Snakebite and black (with blackcurrant) is also known by the name Diesel.http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink250.html This drink is historically popular in student union bars. A particularly strong variant involves a double measure of vodka poured into the drink; this is known as a turbo diesel.
Though Snakebites are usually served mixed, some drinkers prefer to float the beer on top of the cider.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Even if the beer and the cider are perfectly clear before being mixed, the resulting drink will often be cloudy unless it was made with a dry cider.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

[[Snakebite]]

CATEGORIES: Animal attacks, Medical emergencies, Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites of the skin, Venomous snakes, Wilderness medical emergencies

A snakebite is an injury caused by a bite from a snake, often resulting in puncture wounds inflicted by the animal's fangs and sometimes resulting in envenomation. Although the majority of snake species are non-venomous and typically kill their prey with constriction rather than venom, venomous snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Snakes often bite their prey as a method of hunting, but also for defensive purposes against predators. Since the physical appearance of snakes may differ, there is often no practical way to identify a species and professional medical attention should be sought.[tpl]Cite journal|year=2007 |title=Snake Venom Detection Kit: Detection and Identification of Snake Venom |publisher=CSL Limited|url=http://www.csl.com.au/docs/92/398/SVDK_Product_Leaflet,0.pdf|accessdate=2009-11-24 |quote=The physical identification of Australian and Papua New Guinean snakes is notoriously unreliable. There is often marked colour variation between juvenile and adult snakes and wide size, shape and colour variation between snakes of the same species. Reliable snake identification requires expert knowledge of snake anatomy, a snake key and the physical handling of the snake[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last1=White |first1=Julian|year=2006 |title=Snakebite & Spiderbite: Management Guidelines |publisher=Department of Health, Government of South Australia |location=Adelaide |pages=1–71 |url=http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/resources/snakebitespiderbiteguidelinessa-sahealth08|isbn=0-7308-9551-3 |accessdate=2009-11-24 |quote=The colour of brown snakes is very variable and misleading for identification purposes. They may be brown, red brown, grey, very dark brown and may be plain in color, have speckling, stripes or bands, or have a dark or black head[/tpl]
The outcome of snake bites depends on numerous factors, including the species of snake, the area of the body bitten, the amount of venom injected, and the health conditions of the person. Feelings of terror and panic are common after a snakebite and can produce a characteristic set of symptoms mediated by the autonomic nervous system, such as a racing heart and nausea. Bites from non-venomous snakes can also cause injury, often due to lacerations caused by the snake's teeth, or from a resulting infection. A bite may also trigger an anaphylactic reaction, which is potentially fatal. First aid recommendations for bites depend on the snakes inhabiting the region, as effective treatments for bites inflicted by some species can be ineffective for others.
The number of fatalities attributed to snake bites varies greatly by geographical area. Although deaths are relatively rare in Australia, Europe and North America,[tpl]Cite journal |last=Chippaux |first=J.P. |year=1998 |title=Snake-bites: appraisal of the global situation |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=515–24 |url=http://www.kingsnake.com/aho/pdf/menu6/chippaux1998.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03|pmid=9868843|pmc=2305789[/tpl] the morbidity and mortality associated with snake bites is a serious public health problem in many regions of the world, particularly in rural areas lacking medical facilities. Further, while South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa report the highest number of bites, there is also a high incidence in the Neotropics and other equatorial and subtropical regions. Each year tens of thousands of people die from snake bites, yet the risk of being bitten can be lowered with preventive measures, such as wearing protective footwear and avoiding areas known to be inhabited by dangerous snakes.

The National Basketball Association's Coach of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1962–63 NBA season. The winner receives the Red Auerbach Trophy, which is named in honor of the head coach who led the Boston Celtics to nine NBA Championships from 1956 to 1966. The winner is selected at the end of regular season by a panel of sportswriters from the United States and Canada, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The person with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/awards2006_coach.html|title=Dallas’ Avery Johnson Named 2005-06 NBA Coach of the Year|accessdate=July 12, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=April 28, 2006|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com[/tpl]

The most famous wines produced here—those commonly referred to as "Burgundies"—are dry red wines made from Pinot noir grapes and white wines made from Chardonnay grapes. Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as Gamay and Aligoté, respectively. Small amounts of rosé and sparkling wines are also produced in the region. Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and Gamay-dominated Beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region, but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as "Burgundy wines".
Burgundy has a higher number of [tpl]lang|fr|appellations d'origine contrôlée[/tpl] (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most [tpl]lang|fr|terroir[/tpl]-conscious of the French wine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated [tpl]lang|fr|Grand Cru[/tpl] vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations.

[[Finishing (whisky)]]

CATEGORIES: Whisky

Finishing (also known as double matured or wood-finished) is the procedure that some whiskeys undergo whereby the spirit is matured in a cask of a particular origin and then spends time in a cask of different origin (generally 6 months to 2 years[tpl]Citation Needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]). Typically, the first cask is an American oak cask formerly used to mature bourbon. The second cask may be one that has been used to mature some sort of fortified wine, often sherry, though sometimes port, madeira, or even varietal wines such as burgundy or chardonnay are used.
Some of the more well-known finished whiskies include Balvenie "Doublewood", which is finished in sherry casks, Glenlivet "American Oak Finish" and "French Oak Finish", which are finished in brand-new casks of the respective woods, the Glenmorangie range of sherry, port, madeira, and burgundy finishes, and the Diageo line of "Distiller’s Editions", a "Double Matured" expression of each of their classics line of single malt scotch whiskies.

The Grey Teal (Anas gracilis) is a dabbling duck found in open wetlands in New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.
This is a mottled brown duck with white and green flashes on its wings. The male and female Grey Teal share the same colouration, in contrast to the related Chestnut Teal, whose male and female are strikingly different. The Grey Teal has almost identical colouration to the female Chestnut Teal and the Grey can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck and paler face. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head.
The Grey Teal nests near its favoured freshwater lakes and marshes, usually on the ground, but also in tree holes or rabbit burrows.
This is a vocal duck, especially at night. The male gives a soft preep, and the female has a loud quack.
The Grey Teal is a gregarious species. In Australia it is nomadic, rapidly colonising suitable habitat following rain. In 1957, large numbers fled Australia, moving to New Zealand to escape drought.
It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda Teal, as Anas gibberifrons gracilis.
Widespread throughout its large range, the Grey Teal is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
It is often mistaken for a female Chestnut Teal, due to similar colouring.

[[Brass quintet]]
CATEGORIES: Brass quintets, Musical groups by numbers

A brass quintet is a five-piece musical ensemble composed of brass instruments. As an ensemble group, the brass quintet has a broad repertoire containing musical genres from madrigals to jazz. 
The most common instrumentation for a brass quintet is two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone. However, musicians in a brass quintet often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players often double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. In some pieces, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. 
Some quintets substitute a euphonium for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, the tambourine, or the timpani.
The contemporary brass quintet appeared in the late 1940s created by two different groups operating independently: the Chicago Brass Quintet and the New York Brass Quintet. Two members of the Chicago Brass Quintet could be credited with helping plant the seed for the following success of the brass quintet medium: Arnold Jacobs, a tuba player of the Chicago Brass Quintet who taught two founders, Daellenbach and Watts, of the Canadian Brass, and Renold Schilke, a trumpet player also in the Chicago Brass Quintet and a master craftsman who mentored the most successful brass ensemble in history and successfully crafted the first matched set of gold-plated quintet brass instruments. 
The Canadian Brass established both the style and popularity of the quintet medium throughout the world, having performed more than five thousand concerts and selling more than 500,000 quintet music books. The Canadian Brass demonstrates the rise of the brass quintet as an international phenomenon. The wealth of new music for brass quintets can largely be attributed to the American Brass Quintet, which has produced more than 100 new pieces of quintet music.

The Madrona Marsh Preserve, located in Torrance, California, is the last vernal marsh remaining in the South Bay area of Los Angeles and one of few wetlands located within an urban landscape.  
Formed eons ago when the mountains of the Palos Verdes Peninsula rose to the south, Madrona Marsh is a shallow depression fed by wet season (spring) storms as the name "vernal" indicates.  After the rainy season, evaporation, percolation and transpiration reduce the water depth by about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) per day.  By the end of August, the wetland is dry and remains so until the following rainy season.  Situated on land that was set aside for oil production in 1924, Madrona Marsh was never developed—unlike the surrounding city—and remains a valuable natural habitat for birds, reptiles, insects and even small mammals. 
Ongoing efforts are restoring native plants including wildflowers and butterfly species. The area has long been popular with bird watchers and The Audubon Society has used Madrona Marsh for their annual bird census since 1967. El Camino College uses it as an outdoor biology and botany lab. Public access to the Madrona Marsh trails is offered Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and guided tours can be arranged by calling the Nature Center (310) 782-3989.
Oil infrastructure is also evident on the site.
The City of Torrance operates the Madrona Marsh Nature Center in cooperation with the Friends of the Madrona Marsh.  Activities include bird and nature walks, natural history classes and workshops, habitat restoration, science and astronomy programs, art exhibits, and children's nature programs.  The center opened in 2001 and features exhibits about the plants, birds and animals of the marsh.  
The marsh and nature center are closed to the public on Mondays.

CATEGORIES: Radio spectrum

In radio, a guard band is an unused part of the radio spectrum between radio bands, for the purpose of preventing interference.
It is a narrow frequency range used to separate two wider frequency ranges to ensure that both can transmit simultaneously without interfering each other.http://www.techopedia.com/definition/7494/guard-band-telecommunications It is used in Frequency division multiplexing. It may be used in both wired or wireless communications, so that adjacent frequency bands on the same media can avoid interference.

The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in Palm Springs, California, is the largest rotating aerial tramway in the world. It was opened in September 1963 as a way of getting from the floor of the Coachella Valley to relatively near the top of San Jacinto Peak and was constructed in rugged Chino Canyon.  Before its construction, the only way to the top of the mountain was to hike a number of hours from Idyllwild.

[[Thorotrast]]

CATEGORIES: IARC Group 1 carcinogens, Health disasters, Thorium, Withdrawn drugs

Thorotrast is a suspension containing particles of the radioactive compound thorium dioxide, ThO2, that was used as a radiocontrast agent in medical radiography in the 1930s and 1940s. (Use in some countries, such as the U.S., continued into the 1950s.)
Thorium compounds produce excellent images because of thorium's high opacity to X-rays (it has a high cross section for absorption). Unfortunately, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931. (António Egas Moniz contributed to its development.).[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Tondreau | first1 = R. | year = 1985 | title = Egas Moniz 1874-1955 | url = | journal = Radiographics | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 994–997 [/tpl] About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast.

General Hospital (commonly abbreviated GH) is an American daytime television medical drama that is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running American soap opera in production and the third longest-running drama in television in American history after Guiding Light and As the World Turns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/arts_and_media/tv_shows/longest_running_tv_drama.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110419222504/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/arts_and_media/tv_shows/longest_running_tv_drama.aspx|archivedate=April 19, 2011|title=Longest Running TV Drama |work=Arts & Media |publisher=Guinness World Records |year=2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2012[/tpl]Longest-running TV medical drama Concurrently, it is the world's third longest-running scripted drama series in production after British serials The Archers and Coronation Street, as well as the world's second-longest televised soap opera still in production. General Hospital premiered on the ABC television network on April 1, 1963. Same day broadcasts as well as classic episodes were aired on SOAPnet from January 20, 2000 until the network ceased on December 31, 2013. It is the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood, and the longest-running entertainment program in ABC television history. It holds the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series, with 11 wins.
The show was created by husband-and-wife soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a general hospital (hence the title) in an unnamed fictional city; this city was named Port Charles, New York in the 1970s. Upon its beginning, General Hospital starred  John Beradino and Emily McLaughlin, and both actors stayed with the show until their deaths in the 1990s. They were joined a year later by Rachel Ames who remains to date the longest serving actress on an ABC soap opera,  having been continuously on the show from 1964 to 2007. General Hospital was the second soap to air on ABC (after the short-lived Road to Reality, which aired for several months during the 1960–61 season). In 1964, a sister soap was created for General Hospital, The Young Marrieds; it ran for two years, and was canceled due to low ratings. General Hospital also spawned a prime time spinoff with the same name in the United Kingdom from 1972 to 1979, as well as the daytime series Port Charles (1997–2003) and the prime-time spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift (2007–2008) in the United States. Taped at The Prospect Studios, General Hospital aired for a half-hour until July 23, 1976. The series was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to a full hour on January 16, 1978.Boca Raton News, Friday, November 4, 1977 (via Google News archive): http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X94PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mowDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4399,2284786&dq=general+hospital+expands&hl=en
Ever since the late 1970s, most of the storylines have revolved on the environment of Quartermaines and the Spencers. From 1979 to 1988, General Hospital had more viewers than any other daytime soap opera. It rose to the top of the ratings in the early 1980s in part thanks to the monumentally popular "supercouple" Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history.Wolf, Buck.

[[Arab Hellenic Bank]]

The Arab Hellenic Bank was an internationally owned bank based in Greece.
In 1978, in advance of the founding of the bank, the Greek government granted an exemption to its usual prohibition on foreign banks owning more than 40 per cent of the equity of a Greek bank. This permitted several Arab banks to establish Arab-Hellenic Bank with 49 per cent Arab ownership. The bank was founded in 1979, with Vassilis Sarantitis, an influential lawyer and for many years chairman of the Arab-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce, as one of the founders. Ownership was 51% National Bank of Greece, 20% Kuwait Investment Office, 20% Arab Foreign Investment Bank (a Libyan institution), and 9% other Arab investors.
In 1993 the Arab Foreign Investment Bank proposed a cash infusion that would take its ownership to 72%. The plan was to take advantage of the EU "single passport" rules, which would permit Arab Hellenic to open branches in London and elsewhere in the EU, while subject only to Bank of Greece supervision. The UK and US governments protested strongly and blocked the move. In 1995 the Greek government dissolved the insolvent Arab Hellenic Bank at a cost to Greece's Deposit Guarantee Fund of Euro 1.5m in payments to depositors.

Lieutenant General Sir James Whiteside McCay KCMG, KBE, CB, VD (21 December 1864[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]1 October 1930) was an Australian general and politician.
A graduate of the University of Melbourne, where he earned Master of Arts and Master of Laws degrees, McCay established a successful legal practice, McCay & Thwaites. He was a member of the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was a champion of women's suffrage and federation. He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901. He was Minister for Defence from 1904 to 1905, during which he implemented long-lasting reforms, including the creation of the Military Board.
As a soldier, McCay commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign of the Great War. He was later wounded in the Second Battle of Krithia and invalided to Australia, but returned to command the 5th Division, which he led in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916, dubbed "the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history."[tpl]harvnb|McMullin|2006[/tpl]  His failures in difficult military operations made him a controversial figure who earned the disfavour of his superiors, while his efforts to succeed in the face of insurmountable obstacles earned him the odium of troops under his command, who blamed him for high casualties. In the latter part of the war he commanded the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom.
After the war, McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Bank of Victoria and also served on a panel that deliberated on the future structure of the Army. He was chairman of the Fair Profits Commission, the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission, and the  Repatriation Commission's Disposals Board. He commanded the Special Constabulary Force during the 1923 Victorian Police strike.

[[Internal passport]]

An internal passport is an identity document that may or may not be used by a country to control and monitor the internal movement and residence of its people. Internal passports have been used by Imperial Russia and its successor states, France, the Confederate States of America, the Soviet Union, the Ottoman Empire, South Africa during apartheid and other countries. Countries that currently have internal passports include Russia, Ukraine, and North Korea.
When passports first emerged, there was no clear distinction between internal and international ones. Later, some countries developed sophisticated systems of passports for various purposes and various groups of population. Uses for internal passports have included restricting citizens of a subdivided state to employment in their own area (preventing their migration to richer cities or regions), clearly recording the ethnicity of citizens to enforce segregation or prevent passing and controlling access to sensitive sites or closed cities.
Currently, some countries still have internal passports as a part of their bureaucratic heritage but do not use them to restrict the movement of people. In such countries, internal passport are essentially identification documents, though in an archaic booklet form.

The Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) is an analog video disc playback system developed by RCA, in which video and audio could be played back on a TV set using a special needle and high-density groove system similar to phonograph records. 
First conceived in 1964, the CED system was widely seen as a technological success which was able to increase the density of a long-playing record by two orders of magnitude.[tpl]cite web | title = RCA SelectaVision VideoDisc FAQ - Why did the CED system fail to even come close to RCA's expected market penetration? | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/home/cedfaq.html#onesixteen | accessdate = 2007-03-11[/tpl] Despite this achievement, the CED system fell victim to poor planning, conflicts within RCA, and technical difficulties that stalled production of the system for 17 years until 1981, by which time it was outmoded by the DiscoVision (LaserDisc) and emerging Betamax and VHS videocassette formats.  Sales for the system were nowhere near projected estimates, and by 1986, RCA had discontinued the project, losing an estimated $600 million in the process. RCA had initially intended to release the SKT425 CED player with their high end Dimensia system in 1984, but cancelled the CED player as part of the system just prior to the release of the Dimensia system.http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/skt425.html
The format was commonly known as "videodisc", leading to much confusion with the contemporary LaserDisc format. LaserDiscs were read optically with a laser beam, whereas CED videodiscs were read physically with a stylus, rather like a conventional gramophone record. The two systems were mutually incompatible.
The name "SelectaVision" was RCA's brand name for the CED system.  It was also used for some early RCA brand VCRs,[tpl]cite web | title = VBT200 - The First RCA SelectaVision VHS Video Cassette Recorder (VCR) | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html | accessdate = 2007-03-14[/tpl] and other experimental projects at RCA.[tpl]cite web | title = HoloTape | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/holotape.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title= MagTape | publisher = CEDMagic.com | url = http://cedmagic.com/history/magtape.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06[/tpl]

[[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City]]
CATEGORIES: Visitor attractions in Ho Chi Minh City, Chinatowns in Asia, Populated places in Ho Chi Minh City

Chợ Lớn ([tpl]Audio|Cholon.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl]) is a Chinese-influenced section of Ho Chi Minh City (former Saigon). It lies on the west bank of the Saigon River, having Bình Tây Market as its central market. Cholon consists of the western half of District 5 as well as several adjoining neighborhoods in District 6.
The Vietnamese name Cholon literally means "big" ([tpl]unicode|lớn[/tpl]) "market" ([tpl]unicode|chợ[/tpl]). The Chinese name (and original name) of Cholon is 堤岸 (pronounced Tai-Ngon in Cantonese and Dī'àn in Mandarin, which means "embankment" (French: quais). The Vietnamese reading of the Chinese name is [tpl]unicode|Đê Ngạn[/tpl], but this is rarely used. Vietnamese speakers exclusively use the name [tpl]unicode|Chợ Lớn[/tpl], while Chinese speakers (both inside Vietnam and in China) are the only users of the latter.
In 1778, the Hoa (Chinese minority of Vietnam) living in Biên Hòa had to take refuge in what is now Cholon because they were retaliated against by the Tây Sơn forces for their support of the Nguyễn lords. In 1782, they were again massacred by the Tây Sơn and had to rebuild. They built high embankments against the flows of the river, and called their new settlement Tai-Ngon (meaning "embankment" in Cantonese).
Cholon was incorporated as a city in 1879, 11 km from Saigon. By the 1930s, it had expanded to the city limit of Saigon. On April 27, 1931, the two cities were merged to form Saigon-Cholon. In 1956, "Cholon" was dropped from the name and the city became known as Saigon.
During the Vietnam War, soldiers and deserters from the United States Army maintained a thriving black market at Cholon, trading in various American and especially U.S Army-issue items.  This was the area, near the Quan Âm Pagoda where photojournalist Eddie Adams took his famous execution photograph.[tpl]cite book|first=John |last=Faber |title=Great News Photos and the Stories Behind Them |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1978 |page=136 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DqwLVaPdDgoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Four Australian journalists were also killed in Cholon during the Tet Offensive in 1968.[tpl]cite news|first=Hal G.P |last=Colebatch |title=The Saigon media slaughter |newspaper=The Australian |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-06 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/the-saigon-media-slaughter/story-e6frg6q6-1225792583446[/tpl]

[[Phascogale]]

CATEGORIES: Dasyuromorphs, Marsupials of Australia, Mammal genera

The Phascogales (members of the eponymous genus Phascogale), also known as wambengers, are carnivorous Australian marsupials of the family Dasyuridae. There are two species: the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa) and the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura). As with a number of dasyurid species, the males live for only one year, dying after a period of frenzied mating. The term Phascogale was coined in 1824 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in reference to the brush-tailed phascogale, and means "pouched weasel".

[[Descent (aeronautics)]]
CATEGORIES: Flight phases

A descent during air travel is any portion where an aircraft decreases altitude, and is the opposite of an ascent or climb.
Descents are part of normal procedures, but also occur during emergencies, such as rapid or explosive decompression, forcing an emergency descent to below [tpl]convert|10000|ft|m[/tpl] and preferably below [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m[/tpl], respectively the maximum temporary safe altitude for an unpressurized aircraft and the maximum safe altitude for extended duration.[ref]
  The table lists Above 10,000 to be limited to six minutes.[/ref]See Loss of pressurization: The maximum sustained cabin pressure altitude is [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m[/tpl].  To counter potential passenger and crew decompression sickness, hypoxia, edemas, and rewarm the cabin, pilots descend to minimum safe altitude which avoids terrain.
An example of explosive decompression is Aloha Airlines Flight 243. Involuntary descent might occur from a decrease in power, decreased lift (wing icing), an increase in drag, or flying in an air mass moving downward, such as a terrain induced downdraft, near a thunderstorm, in a downburst, or microburst.

Frolic Froth is a psychedelic band formed in Mexico City by members Victor Basurto (bass) and Arturo López (drums) of Loch Ness, and Jorge Beltrán (guitar) from Humus. These three musicians had previously played together in diverse bands along with other musicians during the 1980s and good part of the 1990s, until they finally decided to break away from the sound of previous bands and start Frolic Froth.
Their sound is a heavy in the old psychedelic sense, basically being a tribute to Germany's Guru Guru, Jimi Hendrix and the avant-garde groups known as 'Rock in Opposition': Henry Cow (England), Etron Fou Lelublan (France), Faust (Germany), and others. Some international polls have voted them (in particular the album Ouroboros) as one of the most influential psychedelic albums from Mexico.
They have recorded four albums,  but only released two:

[[Buffalo Bills (quartet)]]

The Buffalo Bills were a barbershop quartet formed in Buffalo, New York, on September 20, 1947.[ref]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q93y2Yjuncs&feature=related The Buffalo Bills on Great Quartets, Part 1[/ref] The original members were tenor Vern Reed, an executive for the Tonawanda Boys' Club,p.148 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony 2003 Oxford University Press lead Al Shea, who was a City of Buffalo policeman, baritone Herschel Smith, a corporate executive, and bass Bill Spangenberg, a truck driver for a steel company. They started out as an unnamed foursome, singing for community groups. During an appearance at the Buffalo Quarterback Club, they were introduced as the "Buffalo Bills", which was meant to be just for that day, but the name stuck from that point on.  Coincidentally, a football team known formerly as the Buffalo Bisons also changed its name to the Bills at about the same time; the name proved popular enough that the current Buffalo Bills also picked up the name when they debuted thirteen years later.
Phil Embury traveled with the Quartet around the world. The Bills competed in the 1948 and 1949 SPEBSQSA International Quartet Contest, placing sixteenth and sixth.
However, Herschel Smith was promoted and transferred to Madison, Wisconsin, and had to leave the quartet. Unable to find a replacement, the Bills broke up. Fortunately, they found baritone Dick Grapes and blossomed quickly. In 1950, they won the Barbershop Harmony Society International Quartet Contest, earning them the title of International Quartet Champions. Soon after their victory, they appeared on the National Radio Show We The People and were honored by the Manhattan and Buffalo chapters on their return trip to their hometown. Their first national television appearance was on The Faye Emerson Pepsi-Cola Show in a television movie in April 1951. The Bills also performed at military bases in France, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea. That same year, the Bills released an album of four records for Decca. Meredith Willson, a famous arranger, composer, and orchestra director, hosted a radio show called Music Today with his wife, heard the album and began to admire the Buffalo Bills' work.p.149 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony 2003 Oxford University Press He travelled to Buffalo with his wife in 1954 to meet them, and began featuring the quartet on his radio show.
In February 1957, the Bills competed on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, won first honors, and received the essential invitation to perform on Godfrey's morning show for the rest of the week. Later that year, Meredith Willson had written and composed The Music Man, a musical set in his hometown of Mason City, Iowa. He included a barbershop quartet in this plot. Willson had heard the Bills' records and suggested they come to New York and audition for the role of the Iowa quartet. They were immediately accepted, but joining the musical meant there were serious changes to be made. They would all have to quit their jobs and move to New York City.
In the end, Dick Grapes decided to stay behind with his job and family life and was replaced by veteran barbershop baritone Wayne "Scotty" Ward of the Great Scots quartet of Steubenville, Ohio.The Buffalo Bills barbershop quartet The quartet took one-year leaves from their jobs (which later became permanent) and moved with their families to New York.p.151 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony 2003 Oxford University Press They continued to make television and radio appearances, including the Arthur Godfrey show, where they met Walter Latzko, a CBS staff music arranger. They were such a hit on Broadway that they were cast in the film adaptation of the musical in 1962. Shortly after filming was completed, Bill Spangenberg became ill and had to leave the quartet. He died the following year. Spangenberg was replaced by Jim Jones, bass of the Sta-Laters quartet.
For the next five years, the Bills performed on the Arthur Godfrey Show as a nightclub act, as guest performers in productions of The Music Man and as headline entertainers on barbershop shows as well as county and state fairs around North America. Their total career consisted of 1,510 performances on Broadway, 728 concerts, 675 radio shows, 672 night club and hotel appearances, 626 conventions, 216 television shows, 137 state fair performances, and 1 film. Their final performance was on May 24, 1967 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. 
The only surviving members of the Buffalo Bills are Jim Jones, who lives in Orlando, Florida,[ref]

The Convention respecting fisheries, boundary and the restoration of slaves between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, also known as the London Convention,  Anglo-American Convention of 1818, Convention of 1818, or simply the Treaty of 1818, was a treaty signed in 1818 between the United States and the United Kingdom. It resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations, and allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the Oregon Country, known to the British and in Canadian history as the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company, and including the southern portion of its sister for district New Caledonia.
The treaty marked the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the Continental United States, while gaining it the northernmost tip of the territory of Louisiana above the 49th parallel north, known as the Milk River in present day southern Alberta and south west Saskatchewan. Britain ceded all of Rupert's Land south of the 49th parallel and west to the Rocky Mountains, including all of the Red River Colony south of that latitude.

[[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]]
CATEGORIES: Government of Chile

The Honourable House of Deputies of the Republic of Chile ([tpl]lang-es|Cámara de Diputados[/tpl]) is the lower house of Chile's bicameral Congress. Its organisation and its powers and duties are defined in articles 42 to 59 of Chile's current constitution.
It comprises 120 deputies, who are elected to four-year terms, by direct universal suffrage, from 60 two-member electoral districts. Deputies must: be aged at least 21; not be disqualified from voting; have finished secondary school or its equivalent; and have lived in the corresponding electoral district for at least two years prior to the election.
Chile's congressional elections are governed by a unique binomial system that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can run two candidates for each electoral district's two Chamber seats. Typically, the two largest coalitions in a district divide the seats, one each, among themselves. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than two-to-one does the winning coalition gain both seats.
The Chamber of Deputies meets in Chile's National Congress located in the port city of Valparaíso, some 120 km west of the capital, Santiago. The Congress building in Valparaíso replaced the old National Congress, located in downtown Santiago, in 1990.

[[Premises]]
CATEGORIES: Real estate, Real property law, Agricultural law

Premises are land and buildings together considered as a property. This usage arose from property owners finding the word in their title deeds, where it originally correctly meant "the aforementioned; what this document is about", from Latin prae-missus = "placed before".
In this sense, the word is always used in the plural, but singular in construction. Note that a single house or a single other piece of property is "premises", not a "premise", although the word "premises" is plural in form; e.g. "The equipment is on the customer's premises", never "The equipment is on the customer's premise".

Sir Raphael "Roy" Welensky, KCMG (20 January 1907 – 5 December 1991) was a Northern Rhodesian politician and the second and last prime minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner mother and a Polish Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became involved with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded in the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.
Becoming Prime Minister of the Federation in 1957, Welensky opposed British moves towards black majority rule, and used force to suppress politically motivated violence in the territories. After the advent of black rule in two of the Federation's three territories (Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, now Zambia and Malawi respectively), it collapsed in 1963. Welensky retired to Salisbury, where he re-entered politics and attempted to stop Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia) from unilaterally declaring itself independent. With the end of white rule in 1979, and the independence of Rhodesia as Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe in 1980, Welensky moved to England, where he died in 1991. A fervent admirer of Britain and the Empire, Welensky described himself as "half Jewish, half Afrikaner and 100% British".Lowry, Donal (May 2003).

[/ref] hyperoctahedron, or cocube is a regular, convex polytope that exists in any number of dimensions. The vertices of a cross-polytope are all the permutations of (±1, 0, 0, …, 0). The cross-polytope is the convex hull of its vertices. Its facets are simplexes of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's vertex figure is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.
The n-dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed unit ball (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the ℓ1-norm on Rn:
In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is simply the line segment +1, in 2 dimensions it is a square (or diamond) with vertices {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}. In 3 dimensions it is an octahedron—one of the five convex regular polyhedra known as the Platonic solids. Higher-dimensional cross-polytopes are generalizations of these.
The cross-polytope is the dual polytope of the hypercube. The 1-skeleton of a n-dimensional cross-polytope is a Turán graph T(2n,n).

Seychelles International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|SEZ|FSIA[/tpl] or Aéroport de la pointe Larue as it is known locally is on the island of Mahé, Seychelles near the capital city of Victoria. It forms part of the administrative districts of La pointe Larue (terminal area), Cascade/Providence (in the North) and Anse aux pins (in the south and military base). 
The airport is 11 km southeast of the capital and is accessible by the Victoria-Providence Highway. There is frequent service from the bus station in Victoria, with taxi ranks outside the terminal available to all locations on Mahé Island and several tour operator's coach services — namely Creole Travel Services and Mason's travel — which also links passengers to the ferry terminal at the Old Port (Vieux port) for inter-island ferry services and to the New Port (Nouveau port) for cruise holidays. 
A domestic terminal is a short walking distance north of the international terminal and offers inter-island flights with a peak of a departure every 10–15 minutes at busy times which corresponds with international arrivals/departures and every 30 minutes at other times. There is plan to link the airport with a light railway/tram system which will run along the east coast of Mahé island due to the high transportation density of this area. Companies were invited to tender in 2007 by the government. 
A cargo terminal is situated south of the international terminal and handles freight from all international and domestic movements; it is run by the national airline Air Seychelles. A military base of the Seychelles Public Defence Force (SPDF) exists at the southeastern end of runway 13 in the south on an island joined with Mahé at the construction of the airport.

State Route 21 is a relic of an old U.S. Route 21, a major north–south highway that connected greater Cleveland, Ohio, to southern South Carolina. South of Strasburg, Ohio, near the current southern terminus of State Route 21, the designation of U.S. Route 21 was moved to the new Interstate 77 freeway in east-central and southeastern Ohio by the early 1970s and then decommissioned. North of Strasburg, what remained of U.S. Route 21 as a route separate from Interstate 77 became State Route 21.
State Route 21 survives in Greater Cleveland as a divided surface road between its current northern terminus at Interstate 77 and Interstate 480 and Interstate 77 just south of the Ohio Turnpike, serving some of the suburbs of Cleveland as a local through route. It coincides with Interstate 77 between two junctions at mileposts 146 and 135 (from north to south) and again splits, State Route 21 passing through Barberton and Massillon, Interstate 77 passing through the much larger cities of Akron and Canton. State Route 21 has its southern terminus north of Strasburg at U.S. 250 near Interstate 77's Exit 87.
Very heavily traveled before the Interstate era, much of State Route 21 is divided highway or even freeway due to the needs of the time.

[[Flags and coats of arms of cantons of Switzerland]]
CATEGORIES: Cantons of Switzerland, Lists and galleries of flags, Swiss coats of arms

There are 26 modern cantons of Switzerland, each of which has an official flag and coat of arms.
The history of development of these designs spans the 13th to 20th centuries.
Historically, the number of cantons was
Nidwalden and Obwalden are traditional subdivisions of Unterwalden. Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft as well as Appenzell Inner- and Ausserrhoden are half cantons, resulting from the division of Basel and Appenzell, respectively.
With the Swiss Federal Constitution of 1999, "half-canton" has ceased to be an official designation, so that the official number of cantons is now 26, the former half-cantons being now referred to as "cantons with half a cantonal vote" officially, even though they are still commonly referred to as half-cantons.
With the exception of Lucerne, Schwyz and Ticino, the cantonal coats of arms are simply arrangements of the cantonal flags in a shield shape. This fashion originates in the 15th century and became commonplace in symbolic depictions of the confederacy during the Early Modern period. In case of Lucerne and Ticino, whose flags consist of fields of different colours divided per fess (horizontally), the coats of arms are of the same colours divided per pale (vertically). Coat of arms of Schwyz has the cross moved from the (hoist) canton to sinister canton with respect to the flag.
Of the 22 cantonal coats of arms as they stood with the creation of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848, six are simple bicolor designs.
Vaud also has a bicolor, but (against heraldic tradition) an added inscription.
The remaining 15 flags include heraldic designs, as follows:

A coil stamp is a type of postage stamp sold in strips one stamp wide. The name derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a manner reminiscent of adhesive tape rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps are sold in coil form, because they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large quantities than either sheet stamps or booklet stamps.

[[Hurricane Danielle (1998)]]
CATEGORIES: 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Category 2 Atlantic hurricanes, 1998 in the United Kingdom

Hurricane Danielle resulted in minor damage throughout its duration as a tropical cyclone in late August and early September 1998. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Danielle originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the disturbance was initially disorganized; under favorable atmospheric conditions, shower and thunderstorm activity began to consolidate around a low-pressure center. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four during the pre-dawn hours of August 24, and further to Tropical Storm Danielle that afternoon. Moving around the southern periphery of the Azores High located in the northeastern Atlantic, quick intensification to hurricane status occurred early on August 25. By 0600 UTC the following day, Danielle reached an initial peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), a Category 2 hurricane. Increased wind shear from a nearby trough encroached on further development later that day, and subsequently led to slight weakening. By 1200 UTC on August 27, despite continued unfavorable conditions, Danielle reached a second peak intensity equal to the first. Weakening once ensued late on August 27 in addition to the days following, and Danielle was a low-end Category 1 hurricane by August 31 as its forward speed slowed. 
As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the ridge that steered it across the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category 1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a 105 mph (165 km/h) tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a baroclinic zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000 UTC on September 4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle's transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged with the system resulted in large waves off the coast of the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported with the system and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage.

Marbles is the 13th studio album from rock band Marillion, released in 2004. Unlike their previous studio album, Anoraknophobia (2001), which was financed largely by a preorder campaign, it was the publicity campaign that fans financed for the album. Those fans who pre-ordered the album received an exclusive 2-CD "Deluxe Campaign Edition" with a booklet containing the names of everyone who pre-ordered before a certain date. The public release date of the retail single-CD version of the album was 3 May 2004 while a plain 2CD version could still be obtained from the band's website. A limited (500 copy) edition was released on white multicoloured vinyl by Racket Records on 13 November 2006.
The album did not chart in the UK, due to it being packaged with a couple of stickers, which is against chart rules, so despite selling enough for a top 30 position, the album was declared ineligible for the album chart, however its first single "You're Gone" reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart, thus becoming their first UK top ten hit since 1987's "Incommunicado". The follow-up single "Don't Hurt Yourself" peaked at #16.

[[Entropy (1977 board game)]]

CATEGORIES: Board games introduced in 1977, Abstract strategy games

Entropy is a two-player abstract strategic game designed by Eric Solomon in 1977. The game is sold commercially under the names Hyle (for a simplified version played on a 5×5 board) and Hyle7.[tpl]bgg|1329|Hyle[/tpl]
The game is played on a square 7×7 grid of cells. One player ("Chaos") draws coloured chips at random from a bag and places each one on the board in an empty space. For each chip that is placed, the other player ("Order") may slide it horizontally or vertically through empty spaces, to rest in a previously empty space. When the grid is full, Order scores for any palindromic patterns of chip colors (e.g. "red–green–blue–green–red") that have been formed horizontally or vertically.Article about Entropy, http://www.boardability.com/game.php?id=entropy, Retrieved on 6 September 2010.
Entropy was awarded a rare 6-out-of-6 by the Games & Puzzles Magazine test panel in 1981.Entropy, Mind Sports Olympiad supplement, p 8, The Times, 11 August 1997, online version available from studiogiochi MSO archives http://www.studiogiochi.com/en/p/MSO1997.html

Mauricio Lasansky (October 12, 1914 – April 2, 2012) was an American graphic artist and printmaker. He was one of the few modern artists who have limited their works almost exclusively to the graphic media. Due to his early contributions in the development of graphic techniques and his dedication to printmaking, Lasansky is considered to be a forerunner in the evolution of the graphic arts as a critical art form and has become recognized as one of the "Fathers of 20th Century American Printmaking." Lasansky is perhaps best known for The Nazi Drawings, which examine the brutality of Nazi Germany.

[[Flag of the Kalmar Union]]

CATEGORIES: Obsolete national flags, Nordic Cross flags, Flags of Norway, Kalmar Union

The flag of the Kalmar Union was derived from the Dannebrog, bearing a Nordic Cross. It is known from only two sources, both dated 1430, in which king Eric of Pomerania tried to enforce its use by two monasteries. It remains unknown whether the flag was ever effectively introduced, and it is unknown whether 1430 was the year it was created, given the sparse textual evidence. No actual flags or depictions of it have survived to document its appearance.
The red and yellow colours are also found in the coat of arms of Norway, and they were also the colours of the Danish Archdiocese of Lund. The reconstructed flag is very similar to the flag currently used by the Swedish Church.
Both of the 1430s references refer to the banner of the realm as consisting of a red cross on yellow. In all likelihood this cross would have been set slightly to the left as known from the flag of Denmark and the (subsequent) flags of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. 
From the mid-1990s until its refashioning in 2007, an identical design was flown as an unofficial flag of Orkney.

The Audubon Ballroom was a theatre and ballroom located on Broadway at 165th Street in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, north of Harlem in New York. It is best known as the site of Malcolm X's assassination on February 21, 1965.  
The Audubon Ballroom was built in 1912 by film producer William Fox, who later founded the Fox Film Corporation. Fox hired Thomas W. Lamb, one of the foremost American theater architects, as its designer. Among the architectural highlights in the façade of the Audubon Ballroom are brown foxes between the windows on the second floor, intended to flatter Fox.Discovering Northern Manhattan: Guide to Washington Heights and Inwood, Chamber of Commerce of Washington Heights and Inwood, Inc.
During its history, the Audubon Ballroom was used as a vaudeville house, a movie theater, and a meeting hall. In the 1930s, Congregation Emes Wozedek, a synagogue whose members were predominantly Jewish immigrants from Germany, began to use the Audubon Ballroom to conduct its religious services.Steven M. Lowenstein, Frankfurt on the Hudson: The German-Jewish Community of Washington Heights, 1933-1983, Its Structure and Culture (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1991) pp. 109-110. ISBN 0-8143-2385-5. In 1950, the congregants purchased the building, and they continued to hold services there until 1983.James Renner, "History of WaHI: Audubon Ballroom", Washington Heights & Inwood Online, May 2003.
After Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam in 1964, he founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). The weekly meetings of the OAAU were held at the Audubon Ballroom and it was at one of those meetings, on February 21, 1965, that Malcolm X was assassinated.
In 1992, Columbia University began the process of demolishing the Audubon Ballroom and replacing it with the Audubon Business and Technology Center, a university-related biotechnology research park that is a public-private partnership between Columbia University Medical Center and the New York state and city governments. Historic preservation groups unsuccessfully sued to prevent its demolition,[tpl]cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA173FF930A35756C0A966958260 |title=A Proposal to Raze Audubon Ballroom Causes Controversy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |last=Buder |first=Leonard |date=May 3, 1990 |work=The New York Times [/tpl] and a group of Columbia students occupied Hamilton Hall on campus in protest. Eventually, the University reached a compromise with local community groups.The University as Urban Developer: Case Studies and Analysis, by David C. Perry, Wim Wiewel, Lincoln Institute, 2005 pp. 54 ff. 
Under the agreement, the University restored a portion of the original façade of the Audubon Ballroom and built a museum inside to honor Malcolm X. In 2005 the University announced the opening of the museum, the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/05/malcolm.html |title=Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center Launches |date=May 17, 2005 |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=May 5, 2010 [/tpl]

[[The Three Periods]]
CATEGORIES: Quebec sovereignty movement, Quebec political phrases

The Three Periods is a Quebec sovereigntist strategy. Before the 1993 federal election in Canada, Parti Québécois (PQ) leader Jacques Parizeau evoked a strategy for attainment of Quebec independence called the Three Periods. The strategy is partly inspired by the three periods of play in ice hockey (the most popular sport in Quebec). It is seen as a typical Parizeau concept: dedicated and straightforward, especially compared to some sovereigntist attitudes like a few (not all) of René Lévesque's (specifically in the last years of his government) or to the étapisme or "step-by-step" strategy.

Interstate 496 (I-496) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also a component of the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway is a loop that connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway 127 (US 127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.
Construction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregations practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.

The Stannary Courts administered equity for the region's tin-miners and tin mining interests, and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines.  Executive authority in stannary areas was exercised by the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. 
The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages.  Special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in Britain, and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in Cornwall and Devon from any jurisdiction other than the Stannary Courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances.  
King John granted a charter to the tin miners of Cornwall and Devon in 1201, confirming their "just and ancient customs and liberties".  The tin miners of both areas originally met together at Hingston Down and referred to themselves as a parliament.  Edward I of England split the stannary institutions between Cornwall and Devon, establishing parliaments and courts for the two counties separately.  The jurisdiction of the Cornwall stannary institutions covered the whole of the county, while the stannary courts of Devon had a reputation for harsh justice,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/lydford_law.htm |title=Lydford Law |publisher=Legendarydartmoor.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13[/tpl] and once jailed a Westminster MP (Richard Strode).[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

The Peace of Wedmore is a term used by historians for an event referred to by the monk Asser in his Life of Alfred, outlining how in 878 the Viking leader Guthrum was baptised and accepted Alfred as his adoptive father.  Guthrum agreed to leave Wessex and a "Treaty of Wedmore" (sometimes called the "Treaty of Chippenham") is often assumed by historians to have existed.  No such treaty still exists. However, there is a document not specifically linked to Wedmore that is a Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum.

The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor. If melanoma is found early, while it is still small and thin, and if it is completely removed, then the chance of cure is high. The likelihood that the melanoma will come back or spread depends on how deeply it has gone into the layers of the skin. For melanomas that come back or spread, treatments include chemo- and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy.

Although a few tracks on his previous release, The Last Dog and Pony Show, had featured tape loops and samples, Mould shocked his fans with such a dramatic embrace of electronica. Rolling Stone magazine awarded the album 2½ stars out of five, declaring: "Ultimately, this is a rock record with electronic effects, not a techno record with guitars, and it falls short of being totally satisfying as either."

[[Nigrostriatal pathway]]

CATEGORIES: Cerebrum, Central nervous system pathways

The nigrostriatal pathway, or the nigrostriatal bundle (NSB), is a dopaminergic pathway that connects the substantia nigra with the striatum. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain, and is particularly involved in the production of movement, as part of a system called the basal ganglia motor loop.
Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra is one of the main pathological features of Parkinson's disease,Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996. leading to a marked reduction in dopamine function in this pathway. The symptoms of the disease typically do not show themselves until 80-90% of dopamine function has been lost.
This pathway is also implicated in producing tardive dyskinesia, one of the side-effects of antipsychotic drugs. These medications (in particular the older typical antipsychotics) block D2 dopamine receptors in multiple pathways in the brain.
The desired clinical effect of reducing psychotic symptoms is thought to be associated with blocking dopamine function in the mesolimbic pathway only. However, as many of these drugs are not selective, they block dopamine in all pathways. When this happens in the nigrostriatal pathway, similar movement problems to those found in Parkinson's disease can occur.

[[Agency (philosophy)]]
CATEGORIES: Action, Social philosophy, Free will, Personhood

In philosophy and sociology, agency is the capacity of an agent (a person or other entity, human or any living being in general, or soul-consciousness in religion) to act in a world. The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and moral agency is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of his physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/

An eternal flame is a flame, lamp or torch that burns continuously for an indefinite period. Most eternal flames are ignited and tended intentionally, but some are natural phenomena caused by natural gas leaks, peat fires and coal seam fires, all of which can be initially ignited by lightning, piezoelectricity or human activity, and all of which can burn for decades or centuries.
In ancient times, human-tended eternal flames were fueled by wood or olive oil; modern examples usually use a piped supply of propane or natural gas. Eternal flames most often commemorate a person or event of national significance, or serve as a reminder of commitment to a common goal, such as international peace.

[[Rosaura Andreu]]
CATEGORIES: 1922 births, 2010 deaths, Cuban emigrants to the United States, People from Orlando, Florida, Disease-related deaths in Florida

Rosaura Andreu (1 January 1918 – 21 November 2010) was a Cuban-born actress who found wide fame in Puerto Rico as a children's television show host.
Andreu, who was a struggling actress in her country, left Cuba after the revolution, arriving in Puerto Rico during the Puerto Rican television's formation era. She became known to the children television viewers in such programs as Romper Room con Berta and others. During the 1970s, she became widely famous across her adopted island when the public television channel, WIPR-TV, started showing her programme, El Show de Titi Chagua (Auntie Chagua's Show).
The show had tough competition, such as WRIK/WLUZ's Sandra Zaiter show, WAPA-TV's El Show de Pacheco (with Joaquin Monserrat as Pacheco) and WKAQ-TV's El show del Tío Nobel (Uncle Nobel's Show). The four main children's shows in Puerto Rico at that era were shown at the same hour every weekday, to compete against each other as El Show de Tio Nobel also had Saturday and Sunday morning editions. However, her show stayed on the air until the middle 1980s, when WLUZ was sold and relaunched as WSTE in 1987. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

The sabbath year (shmita [tpl]lang-he|שמיטה[/tpl], literally "release") also called the sabbatical year or sheviit ([tpl]lang-he|שביעית[/tpl], literally "seventh") is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the Torah for the Land of Israel,This article incorporates text from Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897), a publication now in the public domain. Sabbatical year - every seventh year, during which the land, according to the law of Moses, had to remain uncultivated (Lev. 25:2-7; comp. Ex. 23:10, 11, 12; Lev. 26:34, 35). Whatever grew of itself during that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field. and still observed in contemporary Judaism.
During shmita, the land is left to lie fallow and all agricultural activity, including plowing, planting, pruning and harvesting, is forbidden by halakha (Jewish law). Other cultivation techniques (such as watering, fertilizing, weeding, spraying, trimming and mowing) may be performed as a preventative measure only, not to improve the growth of trees or other plants. Additionally, any fruits which grow of their own accord are deemed hefker (ownerless) and may be picked by anyone. A variety of laws also apply to the sale, consumption and disposal of shmita produce. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted.[tpl]bibleref2|Deut|15:1-11[/tpl]
Chapter 25 of the Book of Leviticus promises bountiful harvests to those who observe the shmita, and describes its observance as a test of religious faith. There is little notice of the observance of this year in Biblical history and it appears to have been much neglected.From Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)

[[Mesocortical pathway]]
CATEGORIES: Central nervous system pathways

The mesocortical pathway is a dopaminergic pathway that  connects the ventral tegmentum to the cerebral cortex, in particular the frontal lobes. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. It is essential to the normal cognitive function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe), and is thought to be involved in cognitive control, motivation, and emotional response.[tpl]cite book| author = Malenka EJ, Nestler SE, Hyman RC | title = Molecular neuropharmacology: a foundation for clinical neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | page = 318 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control |quote=Therapeutic (relatively low) doses of psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, improve performance on working memory tasks both in individuals with ADHD and in normal subjects. Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates that methylphenidate decreases regional cerebral blood flow in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex while improving performance of a spacial working memory task. This suggests that cortical networks that normally process spatial working memory become more efficient in response to the drug. Both methylphenidate and amphetamines act by triggering the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, actions mediated via the plasma membrane transporters of these neurotransmitters and via the shared vesicular monoamine transporter (Chapter 6). Based on animal studies with micro-iontophoretic application of selective D1 dopamine receptor agonists (such as the partial agonist SKF38393 or the full agonist SKF81297) and antagonist (such as SCH23390), and clinical evidence in humans with ADHD, it is now believed that dopamine and norepinephrine, but not serotonin, produce the beneficial effects of stimulants on working memory. At abused (relatively high) doses, stimulants can interfere with working memory and cognitive control, as will be discussed below. It is important to recognize, however, that stimulants act not only on working memory function, but also on general levels of arousal and, within the nucleus accumbens, improve the saliency of tasks. Thus, stimulants improve performance on effortful but tedious tasks, probably acting at different sites in the brain through indirect stimulation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Bidwell LC, McClernon FJ, Kollins SH | title = Cognitive enhancers for the treatment of ADHD | journal = Pharmacol.

This pathway may be the brain system that is abnormal or functioning abnormally in psychoses, such as schizophrenia.Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996.  It is thought to be associated with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which include avolition, alogia and flat affect.  This pathway is closely associated with the mesolimbic pathway, which is also known as the mesolimbic reward pathway.

[[Atong language (Tibeto-Burman)]]

CATEGORIES: Endangered Indian languages, Languages of India, Sal languages

Atong (A'tong) is a Tibeto-Burman language related to Koch, Rabha and Garo. It is spoken in the South Garo Hills and West Khasi Hills districs of Meghalaya state in Northeast India and adjacent areas in Bangladesh. The correct spelling "Atong" is based on the way the speakers themselves pronounce the name of their language. There is no glottal stop in the name and it is not a tonal language. 
No current estimate of the number of speakers is available; according to the Linguistic Survey of India it was spoken by approximately 15,000 people in the 1920s. Since the Atong consider themselves and are considered by the Garos to be a subtribe of the Garos, they are not counted as a separate ethnic or linguistic community by the Indian government.
Almost all Atong speakers are bilingual in Garo to a greater or lesser extent. Garo is seen as a more prestigious language. Since there is a bible translation in Garo, but not in Atong, it is the language used in all churches and most Atong speakers are Christians. Garo is also the language of education in schools in the Atong-speaking area, although some schools provide education in English.

Wild rice (also called Canada rice, Indian rice, and water oats) are four species of grasses forming the genus Zizania, and the grain which can be harvested from them. The grain was historically gathered and eaten in both North America and China. While it is now a delicacy in North America, the grain is eaten less in China,[tpl]Rp|165[/tpl] where the plant's stem is used as a vegetable.
Wild rice is not directly related to Asian rice (Oryza sativa), whose wild progenitors are O. rufipogon and O. nivara, although they are close cousins, sharing the tribe Oryzeae. Wild rice grains have a chewy outer sheath with a tender inner grain that has a slightly vegetal taste.[tpl]cite web | title = What Type of Rice is Healthiest? | last = Reinagel | first = Monica | url = http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/what-type-of-rice-is-healthiest.aspx | date = 19 April 1010| accessdate = 28 January 2010[/tpl]
The plants grow in shallow water in small lakes and slow-flowing streams; often, only the flowering head of wild rice rises above the water. The grain is eaten by dabbling ducks and other aquatic wildlife, as well as humans.

Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection is a 1995 collection of Isaac Asimov's stories and essays. The stories, which comprise its first half, are short pieces which had remained uncollected at the time of Asimov's death. As such, they have been criticized by some as inept or below par—what the writer himself termed "minor Asimov". Likewise, the non-fiction pieces in the book's second half are not generally considered among Asimov's most significant output. Nevertheless, Gold contains some notable works. "Cal" describes a robot that wishes to write, and the title story "Gold" expresses both Asimov's admiration of King Lear and his thoughts on cinema adaptations of his own stories. The story "Gold" won a Hugo Award.

New Frankley in Birmingham is the only civil parish in Birmingham, England. As such, it has its own parish council.
It was established in 2000 in an area in the south-west of the city south of Bartley Reservoir (map), transferred from Bromsgrove (and thus also from Worcestershire to the West Midlands) in 1995, which had previously been part of the Frankley parish. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 7,890.
The parish borders Frankley parish in Bromsgrove District to the north, the unparished area of Birmingham to the east, the unparished area of Rubery to the south, and Romsley parish to the west.
Frankley was intended to have a railway station by extending the old line beyond the disused freight line serving Longbridge through the old Rover car works.  The intention was long stated in the West Midlands Local Transport Plan and in Birmingham's UDP. After deciding that 'providing for' a fast bus link was better than having trains, the intention to eliminate the railway formed a part of the 2008 Longbridge Area Action Plan.

The Pucikwar language, A-Pucikwar, is an extinct language of the Andaman Islands, India, formerly spoken by the Pucikwar people on the south coast of Middle Andaman, the northeast coast of South Andaman, and on Baratang Island.  It belonged to the Great Andamanese family.
As the colonisation and settlement process of the Andaman Islands intensified from the late 19th century and into the 20th century, the indigenous Great Andamanese groups were greatly reduced in number and became alienated from their traditional territories. The few surviving Great Andamanese soon lost the cultural and linguistic distinctions among them that were present at the onset of the 19th century, when at least ten distinct tribal and linguistic groups were recorded. As a language and as a distinct identity, A-Puckiwar and the other groups died out in the early 20th century.

CATEGORIES: Order theory

In mathematics, quantales are certain partially ordered algebraic structures that generalize locales (point free topologies) as well as various multiplicative lattices of ideals from ring theory and functional analysis (C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras). Quantales are sometimes referred to as complete residuated semigroups.
A quantale is a complete lattice Q with an associative binary operation ∗ : Q × Q → Q, called its multiplication, satisfying
and
for all x, yi in Q, i in I (here I is any index set).
The quantale is unital if it has an identity element e for its multiplication:
for all x in Q. In this case, the quantale is naturally a monoid with respect to its multiplication ∗. 
A unital quantale may be defined equivalently as a monoid in the category Sup of complete join semi-lattices.
A unital quantale is an idempotent semiring, or dioid, under join and multiplication.
A unital quantale in which the identity is the top element of the underlying lattice, is said to be strictly two-sided (or simply integral).
A commutative quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is commutative. A frame, with its multiplication given by the meet operation, is a typical example of a strictly two-sided commutative quantale. Another simple example is provided by the unit interval together with its usual multiplication.
An idempotent quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is idempotent. A frame is the same as an idempotent strictly two-sided quantale.
An involutive quantale is a quantale with an involution:
that preserves joins:
A quantale homomorphism is a map f : Q1 → Q2 that preserves joins and multiplication for all x, y, xi in Q, i in I:

CATEGORIES: Armoured fighting vehicle vision and sighting equipment, Military equipment of Poland, Polish inventions, Science and technology in Poland

The Gundlach Periscope, usually known under its British designation as Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV, was a revolutionary invention by Polish engineer Rudolf Gundlach, manufactured for Polish 7TP tanks since end of 1935 and patented in 1936 as Gundlach Peryskop obrotowy. It was the first device to allow the tank commander to have a 360-degree view from his turret with a single periscope. By rotating the periscope and allowing the tank commander to look backwards through the second eyepiece, he no longer had to change position to look behind the turret. Early tanks had small turrets and fixed seating, without an independently rotating cupola, and so the commander wasn't easily able to move himself to another rear-facing periscope.
The design was first used in the Polish 7-TP light tank. Shortly before the war it was given to the British and was used in almost all tanks of WWII, including the British Crusader, Churchill, Valentine,  and Cromwell and the American Sherman. After the German and Soviet attack and fall Poland in 1939 it was copied entirely from captured 7TP and TKS Polish tanks and used in all 1940 and later tanks of the Germany (including the Tiger) and later by USSR (including the T-34 and T-70).
As a part of Polish-British pre-war military cooperation, the patent was sold for a penny (actually 1 Polish Zloty) to Vickers-Armstrong. It was produced as the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV (pictured), and built into all British tanks (Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, Cromwell). After the fall of Poland, Germany, USSR and Romania captured some equipment, allowing them to copy the invention. In USSR the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 (harking to the British designation, as Russian sources openly confirm that it was copied from samples acquired with British-supplied tanks) and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). All Axis tanks and APC (including tanks of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Japan) were equipped or retro-fitted with this periscope till 1941. Later technology was transferred to USA and as a periscope M6 implemented in all US tanks (M3/M5 Stuart, M4 Sherman and others). At the end of WWII this technology was adopted throughout the world and used basically unchanged for almost 50 years, until it was replaced by eletronic devices.

Delivery is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. There are different delivery types. Cargo (physical goods) are primarily delivered via roads and railroads on land, shipping lanes on the sea and airline networks in the air. Certain specialized goods may be delivered via other networks, such as pipelines for liquid goods, power grids for electrical power and computer networks such as the Internet or broadcast networks for electronic information.
The general process of delivering goods is known as distribution. The study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called logistics. Firms that specialize in delivering commercial goods from point of production or storage to point of sale are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as delivery services. Postal, courier, and relocation services also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.

[[Gotha]]

CATEGORIES: Gotha (district), Gotha

Gotha [tpl]IPA-de|ˈɡoːtaː|[/tpl] is the fifth-largest city in Thuringia, Germany, located [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] west of Erfurt and [tpl]convert|25|km|0|abbr=in[/tpl] east of Eisenach with a population of 44,000. The city is the capital of the district of Gotha and was also a residence of the Ernestine Wettins from 1640 until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha originating here spawned many European rulers, including the royal houses of England, Belgium, Portugal (until 1910) and Bulgaria (until 1946).
In the Middle Ages, Gotha was a rich trading town on the trade route Via Regia and between 1650 and 1850, Gotha saw a cultural heyday as a centre of sciences and arts, fostered by the dukes of Saxe-Gotha. The first duke, Ernest the Pious was famous for his wise rule. In the 18th century, the Almanach de Gotha was first published in the city. The cartographer Justus Perthes and the encyclopedist Joseph Meyer made Gotha a leading centre of German publishing around 1800. In the early 19th century, Gotha was a birthplace of the German insurance business. The SPD was founded in Gotha in 1875 by merging two predecessors. In that period, Gotha became an industrial core with companies like the Gothaer Waggonfabrik, a producer of trams and airplanes.
The main sights of Gotha are the early-modern Friedenstein Castle, one of the largest Renaissance/Baroque castles in Germany, the medieval city centre and the Gründerzeit buildings of 19th century commercial boom.
Gotha lies in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin in a flat and agricultural landscape.

[[Lexicographic information cost]]
CATEGORIES: Lexicography

Lexicographic information cost is a new concept within the field of lexicography. The term refers to the difficulties and inconveniences that the user of a dictionary believes or feels are associated with consulting a particular dictionary or dictionary article. For example, the extensive use of abbreviations in articles in order to save space may annoy the user, because it is often difficult to read such condensed texts and understanding the abbreviations, thereby increasing the lexicographic information costs.
The important point in connection with lexicographic information costs is the relation between the information costs anticipated by the user and the information value the user expects to gain from consulting a dictionary or dictionary article. The more easily a user can navigate a dictionary and its articles, the lower the information costs and, hopefully, the more content with the dictionary the user will be. The higher the information costs of a dictionary, the more dissatisfied the user will be. There are two general types of lexicographic information costs: 
The concept of lexicographic information costs was first proposed by the Danish scholar and metalexicographer Sandro Nielsen (see below). The concept is relevant to lexicographers when planning and compiling a dictionary; for the users when consulting the dictionary; and for reviewers when evaluating a dictionary.

Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia (1431–1476/77), was a member of the House of Drăculești, a branch of the House of Basarab, also known by his patronymic name: Dracula. He was posthumously dubbed Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad Țepeș [tpl]IPA-ro|ˈvlad ˈt͡sepeʃ|pron[/tpl]), and was a three-time Voivode of Wallachia, ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462, the period of the incipient Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. His father, Vlad II Dracul, was a member of the Order of the Dragon, which was founded to protect Christianity in Eastern Europe. Vlad III is revered as a folk hero in Romania as well as other parts of Europe for his protection of the Romanian population both south and north of the Danube. A significant number of Romanian and Bulgarian common folk and remaining boyars (nobles) moved north of the Danube to Wallachia, recognized his leadership and settled there following his raids on the Ottomans.
As the cognomen 'The Impaler' suggests, his practice of impaling his enemies is part of his historical reputation.[tpl]cite web|title = Vlad III|year = 2010|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/631524/Vlad-III|accessdate = 26 May 2010[/tpl] During his lifetime, his reputation for excessive cruelty spread abroad, to Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The name of the vampire Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula was inspired by Vlad's patronymic.

The Snowy Mountains Highway is a highway in New South Wales, Australia. Its two sections connect the New South Wales South Coast to the Monaro region, and the Monaro to the South West Slopes via the Snowy Mountains. The higher altitude regions of this road are subject to snow over the winter months, and the road also provides access to many parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The highway bears the B72 shield along its entire length.
The highway originally bore then name Monaro Highway until 1958, when it received its current name. It originally ran from [tpl]NSWcity|Tathra[/tpl] to [tpl]NSWcity|Wagga Wagga[/tpl] but has been shortened to run from the Princes Highway to the Hume Highway instead. Part of the roadway was reallocated to what is now known as the Monaro Highway in 1955. Reservoirs created as a result of dams built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme required the creation of major realignments to avoid submerged areas. Previous to New South Wales' conversion to alphanumeric route markers, it was signed as National Route 18.

An inclined plane is a system used on some canals for raising boats between different water levels. Boats may be conveyed afloat, in caissons, or may be carried in cradles or slings. It can be considered as a specialised type of cable railway.
An inclined plane is quicker, and wastes less water, than a flight of canal locks, but is more costly to install and operate. A development of the idea is the water slope. Another alternative to consecutive locks is a boat lift.

CATEGORIES: Individual locomotives of Great Britain, Preserved London and North Eastern Railway steam locomotives, Railway locomotives introduced in 1938

Number 4468 ''Mallard'' is a London and North Eastern Railway Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotive built at Doncaster, England in 1938. It is historically significant as the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/PlanaVisit/Events/mallard75.aspx|title=Mallard 75|publisher=National Railway Museum|accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl]
The A4 class was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley to power high-speed streamlined trains. The wind-tunnel-tested,[tpl]Solomon-Masterpieces|page=28[/tpl] aerodynamic body and high power allowed the class to reach speeds of over [tpl]convert|100|mph[/tpl], although in everyday service it was relatively uncommon for any steam hauled service in the UK to reach even 90 mph, much less 100. Mallard covered almost one and a half million miles (2.4 million km) before it was retired in 1963.
It was restored to working order in the 1980s, but has not operated since, apart from hauling some specials between York and Scarborough in July 1986 and a couple of runs between York and Harrogate/Leeds around Easter 1987.  Mallard is now part of the National Collection at the United Kingdom's National Railway Museum in York.  On the weekend of 5 July 2008, Mallard was taken outside for the first time in years and displayed beside the three other A4s that are resident in the UK, thus reuniting them for the first time since preservation. It departed the museum for Locomotion, the NRM's outbase at Shildon on the 23 June 2010, where it was a static exhibit, until it was hauled back to York on 19 July 2011 and put back on display in its original location in the Great Hall. 
The locomotive is [tpl]convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid[/tpl] long and weighs 165 tons, including the tender. It is painted LNER garter blue with red wheels and steel rims.

[[Zasechnaya cherta]]
CATEGORIES: Fortifications in Russia, Muscovite Russia, Fortification lines

Zasechnaya cherta ([tpl]lang-ru|Большая засечная черта[/tpl], loosely translated as Great Abatis Line or Great Abatis Border) was a chain of fortification lines, created by Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia to protect it from the raids of the Crimean Tatars who, rapidly moving along the Muravsky Trail, ravaged the southern provinces of the country during a series of the Russo-Crimean Wars.Abatis Lines with maps at cultinfo.ru It also served as a border between the Muscovite State and the steppe nomads. As a fortification line stretching for hundreds kilometers, the Great Abatis Border is analogous to the Great Wall of China and the Roman Limes.
Abatis is a military term for a field fortification made by cutting down trees. The line was built from the felled trees that were arranged as a barricade. It was also fortified by ditches and earth mounds, palisades, watch towers and natural features like lakes and swamps. The width of the abatis mounts up to several hundred meters. In the most dangerous places the abatis was doubled, trebled etc., the gates and small wooden fortresses were created to check the passers.Зеленые стены России, Т. Беляева, "Наука и Жизнь", №5 2004 год. Peasants who lived nearby were forbidden to settle or cut wood in the area, but were obliged by authorities to spend part of their time supporting and renewing the fortifications.Article with photos at defensive-works.ru In the autumn, large areas of steppegrass beyond the line were burnt to deny raiders fodder.
Stone and wooden kremlins of the towns were also included in the Great Abatis Line. Among these towns were: Serpukhov, Kolomna, Zaraysk, Tula, Ryazan, Belyov. Other fortresses in the line were smaller ostrogs.
There were a large number of fortification lines in Russian history and it is difficult to get good information on them.
The lines naturally moved south as the Russian state expanded.  The earliest reference to abatis fortifications appears to be in a Novgorod chronicle of 1137-1139.  Abatis lines began appearing in southern Rus' in the 13th century.  The 'Great Abatis Line' extended from Bryansk to Meschera and was nominally completed in 1566.  It was guarded by a local militia of about 35,000 in the second half of the 16th century.  Another source gives an annual callup of 65,000. Behind the line was a mobile army headquartered in Tula (6,279 men in 1616, 17,005 in 1636).
There are several notable lines. The oldest one (finished by 1563-1566) ran from Nizhniy Novgorod along the Oka River to Kozelsk,Бобровский М.В. Козельские засеки (эколого-исторический очерк). Калуга: Изд-во Н. Бочкаревой, 2002. 92 с., with maps and illustrations (in Russian) and was built by Ivan the Terrible. The next one, built a while later, followed the line Alatyr - Orel - Novgorod Seversky - Putivl. Feodor I of Russia had built the abatis on the line Livny - Kursk - Voronezh - Belgorod. Simbirsk lineSimbirsk Archeology was constructed about 1640, and continued the Belgorod line from Tambov to Simbirsk on the Volga River.Khodarkovsky,Michael, "Russia's Steppe Frontier", 2002. In 1730-31 the Kama line separated Kazan from the Bashkirs. From about 1736 a Samara-Orenburg line closed in the Baskirs from the south.

The term it usually used to refer to those groups of Mennonites who practice a lifestyle without some elements of modern technology. A large minority of them uses cars, whereas a majority have retained horse and buggy transportation. They are almost entirely of Swiss German or south German descent and speak Pennsylvania German. Very conservative Plautdietsch speaking Russian Mennonites, who may have a similar belief and lifestyle are normally not called "Old Order Mennonite". There are quite a lot of similarities between Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish and to a lower extent with conservative Russian Mennonites living in Latin America and with the Hutterites.

[[X*Press X*Change]]

X*Press X*Change is an obsolete computer-based news-ticker-style newsfeed service that existed during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s. The X*Press service debuted in late 1986 as a low cost, publicly available newswire service that used personal computers to read and process the real-time data. X*PRESS Information Services, Ltd. was a partnership between McGraw-Hill and former cable television giant Tele-Communications, Inc. (purchased by AT&T Corporation and later spun off). Data included delayed stock ticker quotes and news headlines from the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, McGraw-Hill, Standard & Poor's, Reuters, and UPI. News from outside the U.S. was contributed by Kyodo, ITAR-TASS and Xinhua.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fincke |first=Karl |year=1992 |title=Dishing Up Data |journal=Satellite TV 1992 Buyer's Guide |pages=74 |publisher=Fortuna Communications Corp. |accessdate=2009-08-25[/tpl]
The X*Press service was transmitted by way of satellite. Specifically, the system's data stream was carried on C-Band satellite onboard CNN's (later WGN's) transponder using General Instrument (now part of Motorola) InfoCipher 1500P satmodem technology. The InfoCipher modem was an add-on to VideoCipher II+/RS TVRO receivers and received the data at 9600 bits per second.
Participating cable companies could also send the data signal over their distribution systems to cable subscribers, who used a cable TV version of the InfoCipher modem and software on a home computer to decode and display the information stream.  The software — called X*Press X*Change and X*Press Executive — was available for the Amiga, Apple Macintosh, Apple II, Atari ST, and MS-DOS platforms, although the Macintosh version was considered superior to the MS-DOS version.  Sometime in the 1990s, the X*Press X*Change service was renamed InGenius, and faded into obscurity shortly afterward with the rise of the modern Internet as well as improved cable television on-screen graphics technology. The X*Change/InGenius service was discontinued in 1997.

[[Metallum Martis]]

CATEGORIES: 1665 books, Theories

Metallum Martis, a 1665 book by Dud Dudley, is the earliest known reference to the use of coal in metallurgical smelting. The book is also referred to as Iron made with Pit-Coale, Sea-Coale, &c. And with the same Fuell to Melt and Fine Imperfect Mettals, And Refine perfect Mettals.
Many attendant difficulties had to be overcome before this fuel could be applied to the purpose of smelting iron. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on Pensnett Chase and at Cradley, of a furnace at Himley, and of a furnace at Hasco Bridge near Gornal.
Dudley does mention several things that indicate what he was doing. The coal he used was the small pieces and slack which were "little or of no use in that inland country" and so brought in no money. This coal debris was left in heaps and "crowded moist slack heat naturally, and kindle in the middle of these great heaps, often sets the coal works on fire" and that "Also from these sulphurous heaps, mixed with ironstone (for out of many of the same pits is gotten much ironstone or mine), the fires heating vast quantities of water, passing through these soughs or adits becometh as hot as the bath at Bath".Scrivenor quoting Dudley, [tpl]harv|Scrivenor|1854|p=40,41[/tpl] Dudley describes two rival attempts to smelt iron with coal instigated by supporters of Parliament during the Civil War and the Interregnum. Dudley visited both sites and having examined their furnaces and production methods, when asked his opinion, informed the proprietors that they would fail. The first attempt was by Captain Buck, with the backing of many parliamentary officers including Oliver Cromwell, with technical help from Edward Dagney, an Italian. In the second attempt in the late 1656–67 by Captain John Copley also failed despite Dudley, at no charge, improving the efficiency of Copley's bellows. Dudley reapplied for a patent from Charles II, in 1660 stating "and seeing no man able to perform the mastery of making of iron with pit-coal or sea-coal, ... my laudable inventions the author was, and is, unwilling they should fall to the ground and die with him".Scrivenor quoting Dudley, [tpl]harv|Scrivenor|1854|pp=45–48[/tpl]
A significant feature of his great work Metallum Martis is a map showing Dudley Castle where he correctly identifies the order and geographic layout of strata of coal and ironstone under survey.
Considered to be the earliest of recorded geologic maps, Metallum Martis marks a turning point in the evolution of scientific rationale concerning the recording and interpretation of geological information. It is considered to have been made at Castle Hill in Dudley by Dud Dudley in 1665.

Suckdog or "Suckdog Circus" was an American underground band.   The core members were the married couple Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costes. The troupe toured every state in the continental United States for several years, performing a mix of wrestling, musical performances, film-screenings and general audience agitation. The heart of the Suckdog Circus were the noise music "operas" written by Costes and Carver which involved strange experimental fantasy stories with lots of blood, sex and audience agitation.
Other performers in the Suckdog Circus included Dame Darcy, Davey "OHIO" Highben, Coz the Shroom, Nick Zedd and Helen Suckpuppy.
Suckdog also recorded four albums: Rape GG (1988), Drugs are Nice (1989), Little Flowers Dying (1990) and Onward Suckdog Soldiers (1998).

Canadiana is a term referring to things related to the country of Canada.  It is most often used to refer to a class of books somewhat wider than Canadian Literature because it also includes books about Canada as well as Canadian non-fiction works.  
The term is very general for it can include books (non fiction as well as fiction) which do not deal with Canada or Canadians but which were written by Canadians or persons who were Canadians at one point in their life.  
It is a categorization often seen in bookstores and in research libraries.
One of the specific mandates of the Library and Archives Canada is to collect, organize and make available Canadiana. 
The term can also be used more generally to describe a collection of distinctly Canadian items of artifacts or a collection of Canadian works in another cultural field such as music or art.
The two books by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, Souvenir of Canada and Souvenir of Canada 2, are collections of images of pop-culture Canadiana.

[[Web feed]]

CATEGORIES: XML-based standards, Web syndication, Change detection and notification

A web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe to it. Making a collection of web feeds accessible in one spot is known as aggregation, which is performed by an aggregator. A web feed is also sometimes referred to as a syndicated feed.
A typical scenario of web feed use is: a content provider publishes a feed link on their site which end users can register with an aggregator program (also called a feed reader or a news reader) running on their own machines; doing this is usually as simple as dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator. When instructed, the aggregator asks all the servers in its feed list if they have new content; if so, the aggregator either makes a note of the new content or downloads it. Aggregators can be scheduled to check for new content periodically. Web feeds are an example of pull technology, although they may appear to push content to the user.
The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media. Often when websites provide web feeds to notify users of content updates, they only include summaries in the web feed rather than the full content itself.
Web feeds are operated by many news websites, weblogs, schools, and podcasters.

There are two major ideological cleavages in Faroese politics.  In addition to the left-right spectrum, parties are also divided between those that want to maintain the Faroes' place within the Danish Realm ('unionists') and those that want Faroese independence ('separatists').
The current government is formed by a coalition between the two major centre-right parties, the Union Party and the People's Party, and the small, centrist Centre Party and Self-Government Party.

The Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) was a British financial institution. Trustee savings banks originated to accept savings deposits from those with moderate means. Their shares were not traded on the stock market but, unlike with mutually held building societies, depositors had no voting rights; nor did they have the power to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organisation. Directors were appointed as trustees (hence the name) on a voluntary basis. The first trustee savings bank was established by Reverend Henry Duncan of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire for his poorest parishoners in 1810 with its sole purpose being to serve the local people in the community .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lloydstsb.com/about_ltsb/tsb.asp |title=Lloyds Bank - Banking With Us - Our History, Heritage & Who We Are |publisher=Lloydstsb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] Between 1970 and 1985, the various trustee savings banks in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into a single institution named TSB Group plc, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange.

Mutual Street Arena, initially called Arena Gardens or just the Arena, was an ice hockey arena and sports and entertainment venue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From the time period of 1912 until 1931, with the opening of the Maple Leaf Gardens, it was the premier site of ice hockey in Toronto, being home to teams from the National Hockey Association (NHA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and the International Hockey League (IHL).  It was the first home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who played at the arena under various names for their first 13.5 seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically-frozen or 'artificial' ice surface, and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster Foster Hewitt. 
The Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings and other sporting events, including professional boxing, cycling, wrestling and tennis. In 1962, it was later converted to a curling club and roller skating rink known as The Terrace. The building was demolished in 1989 and the Cathedral Square residential complex and Arena Gardens municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of Dundas Street East and one block east of Church Street in downtown Toronto.

[[Regions of the Faroe Islands]]
CATEGORIES: Subdivisions of the Faroe Islands, Country subdivisions of Europe

The Faroe Islands are divided into 30 municipalities, six regions/shires (sýsla, sýslur in plural) and since 2007 there has been only one constituency, earlier there were seven constituencies.Logting.elektron.fo, 5 Uppskot til  løgtingslóg um broyting í løgtingslóg um val til Føroya LøgtingLogting.ekektron.fo, 21 Uppskot til  samtyktar um Føroyar sum eitt valdømi Each region has one sheriff (sýslumaður).
The administrative subdivisions of the Faroe Islands are frequently changing. In the 1980s there were more than 50 municipalities. During the last past decades the number has been decreasing steadily, and more municipal-mergers can be expected within the following years. The aim of the ministry of interior is that in 2015 there will be only seven or nine municipalities in the Faroe Islands, more or less following the boundaries of the districts and constituencies. If this happens the Faroe Islands will have left the administrative structure of "parish-municipalities" which was built up in the first half of the 20th century and entered a structure of "regional-municipalities". 
Furthermore there was a long-running discussion on reducing or even removing the constituencies. In the end, from the 2008 election onwards, the constituencies were abolished.
The regions (sýsla) are not administrative parts of the islands like the municipalities (kommuna), the municipalities charge taxes from the citizens who live there. The regions cannot charge taxes from the citizens who live there. The regions are mostly used by the public churches in the registration of births, deaths, marriages, divorces, namegivings etc., but the central administration which gathers these informations from the priest and the municipalities is placed in Tórshavn, it is called Lansfólkayvirlitið, it is now a part of the The Environment Agency (Umhvørvisstovan).US.fo, The Environment Agency (in English) US.fo, Landsfólkayvirlit 
The regions are also used regarding pilot whale huntings, the sheriff decides if a pod of pilot whales can be killed or not, the boats need to get his permission before any slaughter can take place, and in some regions he also decides to which villages the whale meat and blubber should be given to. This is the case in Suðuroy, if men from the southern part of the island participate in a whale hunt, they are not sure to get any meat at all, if the sheriff decides, that there are too few whales in order to divide it to the whole island and can decide to give it only, for example, to the northern part or to specific villages or to homes for the elderly.

[[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]]

CATEGORIES: Honorary titles, Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports, Cinque ports, Ceremonial officers in the United Kingdom, Governors in the British Islands

The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is a ceremonial official in the United Kingdom. The post dates from at least the 12th century but may be older. The Lord Warden of the Cinque ("Five", in Norman French) Ports was originally in charge of the Cinque Ports, a group of five port towns on the southeast coast of England. Today the role is a sinecure and an honorary title, and today 14 towns belong to the Cinque Ports confederation. The title is one of the higher honours bestowed by the Sovereign. It has often been held by members of the Royal Family or Prime Ministers, especially those who have been influential in defending Britain at times of war.
The Lord Warden was solely responsible for the return of all writs to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James's church, near Dover Castle, and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of Chancery. He also had a "lieutenant's powers of muster", and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added to the Warden's office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the Clerk and the Lieutenant of the Castle.
The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports first appeared in 1305, second amongst the earliest English known heraldic emblems, predating even the coat of arms of the City of London. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports displays three ships' hulls and three lions passant guardant conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. These may originally have been Gules three lions passant gardant in pale Or (for England) dimidiating Gules three ships' hulks in pale Or. The coat of arms of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports is set out on a red and blue background and traditionally represents the 14 'Corporate' Members.

The Flying Dutchman is a legendary ghost ship that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from 17th-century nautical folklore. The oldest extant version dates to the late 18th century.
Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. If hailed by another ship, the crew of the Flying Dutchman will try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom.

[[.de]]
CATEGORIES: Country code top-level domains, Internet in Germany, German media, Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries members, 1986 introductions

.de is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Federal Republic of Germany. DENIC (the Network Information Centre responsible for .de domains) does not require specific second-level domains, and there are no official ccSLDs under .de ccTLD, as it is the case with the .uk domain range which require .co.uk domain for example.
The name is based on the first two letters of the German name for Germany (Deutschland). Prior to 1989, East Germany had a separate ISO 3166-1 code (dd), and had a never delegated ccTLD, .dd.
.de is currently the most popular ccTLD in terms of number of registrations with .uk being the second most popular ccTLD and .cn being third. It is second after .com among all TLDs.[tpl]cite web|author=DENIC|url=http://www.denic.de/en/background/statistics/international-domain-statistics/|title=Comparison of international Domain Numbers|accessdate=2012-07-18[/tpl]
The first point of registration for .de domains was at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Dortmund. uni-dortmund.de was among the first registered .de-domains.
.de registrations may be directly ordered from DENIC but it is faster and cheaper to do so via a DENIC member (registrar).
Previously, domain names had to be at least three letters long. There were a few two-letter domains registered before the rule was put in place: db.de (Deutsche Bahn), ix.de (the German computing magazine iX), and hq.de. A fourth domain, bb.de (Bilfinger Berger), was later deregistered. As of 23 October 2009, DENIC allowed the registration of single- and two-letter domains as well as number-only domains.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.denic.de/en/denic-in-dialogue/press-releases/press/2351.html |title=DENIC eG Eases Domain Guidelines |publisher=DENIC[/tpl]
Registrations of internationalized domain names are also accepted so that all diacritics of German, many diacritics of other languages and the eszett, ß, may be used.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.denic.de/en/domains/internationalized-domain-names/idn-list.html |title=IDN character list |publisher=DENIC[/tpl]
In many of the Romance languages, e.g., Spanish, French, Romanian and Portuguese, "de" expresses the genitive of a noun (like "of" in English). This is exploited in domain registrations under the German TLD for romance language webhosts that offer customized sites, like elforo.de (theforum.of), encoding the site name into the URL path, such as elforo.de/wikipedia, meaning theforum.of/Wikipedia.

Stephan G. Stephansson (October 3, 1853 – August 10, 1927) was a Western Icelander, poet, and farmer. His original name was Stefán Guðmundur Guðmundsson.
He was born in Skagafjörður, Iceland but emigrated to Wisconsin, USA in 1873, at age 19. In 1889 he moved to Markerville, Red Deer County, Alberta, Canada. He did not see Iceland again until 1917, when he was 64 years old.
Stephan was self-educated and worked hard all his life. He wrote after work, and, being an insomniac, he often wrote till dawn. He was under the influence of the American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson and they shared the same beliefs in many matters, including, but not limited to, equal rights for men and women. Stephan wrote only in Icelandic and had great influence in his former home country.
His poems were published in a six volume book called "Andvökur" (Sleepless Nights).
His letters and essays were published in four volumes, and even if nothing of his poetry had survived, those would have been enough to single him out as one of Iceland's foremost men of letters.
His homestead near Markerville is an Alberta Provincial Historic Site.  It has been restored and is open to the public from May 15 until August 31.

In military combat, the concept of cover refers to anything which is capable of physically protecting an individual from enemy fire. This differentiates it from the similar concept of concealment, in that an object or area of concealment only affords the benefit of stealth, not actual protection from small arms fire or artillery fragments. An example of "cover vs. concealment" would be sandbags vs. tall grass.

Greater Western Sydney (GWS) is the region of the metropolitan area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia that is generally accepted to embrace the northwest, southwest, central west, and western sub-regions of greater metropolitan Sydney. The University of Western Sydney defines greater western Sydney as comprising 14 local government areas; namely located within Auburn, Bankstown, Blacktown, Blue Mountains, Camden, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Holroyd, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith, The Hills Shire and Wollondilly.
In government administration, the region has a Minister for Western Sydney, currently held by the Premier, the Hon. Barry O'Farrell, MP.
The population is predominantly of a working class background, with major employment in the heavy industries and vocational trade. The fourteen local government areas which comprise the Greater West together generate more than A$95 billion in Gross Regional Product a year, making its economy the third largest in Australia behind the Sydney CBD and Melbourne.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951) is a British drama film made by Romulus Films and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States. The film was directed by Albert Lewin and produced by Lewin and Joe Kaufmann from his own screenplay, based on the legend of The Flying Dutchman. It was filmed mainly on the Costa Brava. The land record speed scenes were shot at Pendine Sands in Wales.
The film starred Ava Gardner and James Mason, featuring Nigel Patrick, Sheila Sim, Harold Warrender, Mario Cabré and Marius Goring.  The cinematographer was Jack Cardiff.  Most of the movie was shot on location in Tossa de Mar, Catalonia, Spain, where a statue of Gardner has been erected on the hill overlooking the town's main beach.
MGM delayed its release until Gardner's star-making role in 1951's Show Boat.  The tactic worked, and this film solidified her status as a rising star.

[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]

CATEGORIES: Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, 1893 short stories, English Civil War fiction, Works originally published in The Strand Magazine

"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual" is a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The story was originally published in Strand Magazine in 1893, and was collected later in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Unlike the majority of Holmes stories, the main narrator is not Doctor Watson, but Sherlock Holmes himself. With Watson providing an introduction, the story-within-a-story is a classic example of a frame tale. It is one of the earliest recorded cases investigated by Holmes, and establishes his problem solving skills.
"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual" shares elements with two Edgar Allan Poe tales: "The Gold Bug" and "The Cask of Amontillado".
In 1927, Conan Doyle ranked the story at 11th place on his top 12 Holmes stories list. The story did better in a 1959 chart produced by the Baker Street Journal, ranking 6th out of 10. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

[[Antiprocess]]

CATEGORIES: Social psychology, Defence mechanisms

Antiprocess is the preemptive recognition and marginalization of undesired information by the interplay of mental defense mechanisms: the subconscious compromises information that would cause cognitive dissonance. It is often used to describe a difficulty encountered when people with sharply contrasting viewpoints are attempting (and failing) to discuss a topic. 
In other words, when one is debating with another, there may be a baffling disconnect despite one's apparent understanding of the argument. Despite the apparently sufficient understanding to formulate counter-arguments, the mind of the debater does not allow him to be swayed by that knowledge.
There are many instances on the Internet where antiprocess can be observed, but the prime location to see it is in Usenet discussion groups, where discussions tend to be highly polarized. In such debates, both sides appear to have a highly sophisticated understanding of the other position, yet neither side is swayed. As a result, the debate can continue for years without any progress being made.

Amália da Piedade Rodrigues GCSE, GCIH (July 23, 1920 – October 6, 1999), known as Amália Rodrigues ([tpl]IPA-pt|ɐˈmaliɐ ʁuˈðɾiɣɨʃ[/tpl]), was a Portuguese singer and actress. Known as the Rainha do Fado ("Queen of Fado"), Rodrigues helped popularize fado worldwide and traveled internationally between the 1950s and 1970s. She also became one of the most important figures in the genre's development, becoming the pre-eminent female fadista during a 50-year recording and stage career. Amália was the main inspiration for other well-known international fado and popular music artists such as Madredeus, Dulce Pontes, and Mariza.
Amália Rodrigues remains today Portugal's most famous artist and singer, a woman who was born into an almost destitute family and who grew to become not only Portugal's major star but also an internationally acclaimed artist and singer, whose career spanned 55 years, recording songs in several languages (especially Portuguese, Spanish, French, English and Italian), versions of her own songs, most famously "Coimbra" ("April In Portugal") and performing all over the world, achieving tremendous success in countries like France, Italy, Argentina, Spain, the USA, Mexico, Brazil, Romania, Japan and The Netherlands, among many others.
Her personality and charisma, her beauty and her extraordinary timbre of voice gave depth and intense life to her singing: the impression she made on the public, her immediacy and the natural way she empathized with her public were tremendous and attracted more and more admirers throughout the world.
By the time of her death in 1999, Amália had received more than 40 decorations and honors from all over the world (mostly France, including the Légion d'Honneur, Lebanon, Portugal, Spain, Israel and Japan).
Most importantly Amália put fado as a musical genre on the map of world music, in dictionaries, libraries and musical essays. She paved the way for the generations that would follow, and that continue her legacy.

[[Westminster Bubble]]

CATEGORIES: Media and communications in the City of Westminster, Political terms in the United Kingdom

The Westminster Bubble (also called the Westminster village) is a characterization of members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as being isolated from life outside Parliament.  This includes Members of Parliament, Peers, lobbyists, researchers, secretaries, civil servants, lobby correspondents and leader writers for newspapers and is so named because Parliament is located in Westminster, London.
A similar situation occurs in the United States, where the governmental culture in and around Washington DC is sometimes known as the Washington Bubble or more often Inside the Beltway.  More recently, in Scotland, there has been a development of a "Holyrood bubble", as the Scottish Parliament is in the Holyrood district of Edinburgh.
A recent example of the characterization includes Peter Hain speaking in the House on 29 January 2004:
 "All broadcasters, the whole coverage of politics, the Westminster bubble that we as politicians of the Government and Opposition occupy together with the Westminster lobby; together we are all conducting politics in a way that is turning off voters, listeners, readers and watchers by the million." 
In July the previous year he had described it in a newspaper article as:
  "That politically incestuous world occupied by politicians, government and opposition, together with the media. Politicians, news broadcasters and journalists now form a 'political class' which is in a frenzied world of its own, divorced from the people, and which is turning off viewers, listeners and readers from politics by the million.".
 
In November 2003 Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard indicated on the day of his appointment that he wished to be a "leader outside the Westminster Bubble."

[[120-cell]]
CATEGORIES: Four-dimensional geometry, Polychora

In geometry, the 120-cell (or hecatonicosachoron) is the convex regular 4-polytope with Schläfli symbol {5,3,3}. 
The boundary of the 120-cell is composed of 120 dodecahedral cells with 4 meeting at each vertex.
It can be thought of as the 4-dimensional analog of the dodecahedron and has been called a dodecaplex (short for "dodecahedral complex"), hyperdodecahedron, and polydodecahedron. Just as a dodecahedron can be built up as a model with 12 pentagons, 3 around each vertex, the dodecaplex can be built up from 120 dodecahedra, with 3 around each edge.
The Davis 120-cell, introduced by [tpl]harvtxt|Davis|1985[/tpl], is a compact 4-dimensional hyperbolic manifold obtained by identifying opposite faces of the 120-cell, whose universal cover gives the regular honeycomb {5,3,3,5} of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space.

[[Whitewater slalom]]
CATEGORIES: Canoeing and kayaking competitions, Olympic sports

Whitewater slalom (canoe/kayak slalom since November 2008) is a competitive sport where the aim is to navigate a decked canoe or kayak through a course of hanging gates on river rapids in the fastest time possible. It is one of the two kayak and canoeing disciplines at the Summer Olympics, and is referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as Canoe/Kayak slalom. The other Olympic canoeing discipline is canoe sprint. There is also wildwater, a non-Olympic paddlesport.
Whitewater slalom racing started in Europe and in the 1940s, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) was formed to govern the sport. The first World Championships were held in 1949 in Switzerland. From 1949 to 1999, the championships were held every odd-numbered year and have been held annually in non-Summer Olympic years since 2002.  Folding kayaks were used from 1949 to 1963; and in the early 1960s, boats were made of fiberglass, and nylon.  Boats were heavy, usually over 65 pounds (30 kilos).  With the advent of kevlar and carbon fiber being used in the 1970s, the widths of the boats were reduced by the ICF, and the boats were reduced in volume to pass the gates, and boats have become much lighter and faster.
From 1949 to 1977, all World Championships were held in Europe.  The first World Championship held in North America was held at Jonquiere, in Quebec, Canada in 1979.
It has been a regular Olympic sport since 1992.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.canoeicf.com/icf/London2012/Canoeing-at-the-Olympic-Games.html | title=Canoeing at the Olympics | publisher=International Canoe Federation | accessdate=July 24, 2012[/tpl]

[[Ordinary (heraldry)]]
CATEGORIES: Heraldic ordinaries

In heraldry, an ordinary (or honourable ordinary) is a simple geometrical figure, bounded by straight lines and running from side to side or top to bottom of the shield. There are also some geometric charges known as subordinaries, which have been given lesser status by some heraldic writers, though most have been in use as long as the traditional ordinaries.  Diminutives of ordinaries and some subordinaries are charges of the same shape, though thinner. Most of the ordinaries are theoretically said to occupy one-third of the shield; but this is rarely observed in practice, except when the ordinary is the only charge (as in the coat of arms of Austria).
The terms ordinary and subordinary are somewhat controversial, as they have been applied arbitrarily and inconsistently among authors, and the use of these terms has been disparaged by some leading heraldic authorities.See "CHAPTER IX: THE SO-CALLED ORDINARIES AND SUB-ORDINARIES" in Fox-Davies (1909) A Complete Guide to Heraldry.  In his Complete Guide to Heraldry (1909), Arthur Charles Fox-Davies asserted that the terms are likely inventions of heraldic writers and not of heralds,Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 106–107. arguing the "utter absurdity of the necessity for any such classification at all," and stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, "no more than first charges."Fox-Davies (1909), p. 107.

[[Sub-replacement fertility]]
CATEGORIES: Population, Demography, Human geography, Fertility, Economic problems

Sub-replacement fertility is a total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new generation being less populous than the previous one in a given area.  In developed countries sub-replacement fertility is any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates.[tpl]cite journal|title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility|author=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, and Westoff CF|year=2003|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|volume=22|pages=575|doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e|issue=5/6[/tpl], Introduction and Table 1, p. 580 Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.  This can be "translated" as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a "third of a child" to make up for the higher probability of boys being born, and early mortality prior to the end of their fertile life.For example in the United Kingdom in 2001 304,635 boys were born as opposed to 289,999 girls, and some of these girls will not survive to the end of their child bearing years. In future, therefore, the girls born in this year would have to have more than two children each to replace the total population. For a full explanation see 'Replacement Fertility, What has it been and What does it mean?' (PDF)
Replacement level fertility in terms of the net reproduction rate (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account.
[[File:Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg|Map of countries by fertility rate.
|thumb|right|400px]]
As of 2010, about 48% of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility.http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_8.htm, Nonetheless most of these countries still have growing populations due to immigration, population momentum and increase of the life expectancy. This includes most nations of Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Russia, Iran, Tunisia, China, and many others. The countries or areas that have the lowest fertility are Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Ukraine and Lithuania. Only a few countries have low enough or sustained sub-replacement fertility (sometimes combined with other population factors like emigration) to have population decline, such as Japan, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/ |title=International Data Base |accessdate=2007-09-30 |publisher=United States Census Bureau[/tpl]

[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)]]
CATEGORIES: 1906 ships, Dreadnought-class battleships, Portsmouth-built ships, World War I battleships of the United Kingdom

HMS ''Dreadnought'' was a battleship of the Royal Navy that revolutionised naval power. Her entry into service in 1906 represented such a marked advance in naval technology that her name came to be associated with an entire generation of battleships, the "dreadnoughts", as well as the class of ships named after her. The generation of ships she made obsolete became known as "pre-dreadnoughts". She was the sixth ship of that name in the Royal Navy.
Admiral Sir John "Jacky" Fisher, First Sea Lord of the Board of Admiralty, is credited as the father of the Dreadnought. Shortly after he assumed office he ordered design studies for a battleship armed solely with [tpl]convert|12|in|0|adj=on[/tpl] guns and a speed of [tpl]convert|21|kn|lk=in[/tpl]. He convened a "Committee on Designs" to evaluate the alternative designs and to assist in the detailed design work. One ancillary benefit of the Committee was that it would shield him and the Admiralty from political charges that they had not consulted leading experts before designing such a radically different battleship.
Dreadnought was the first battleship of her era to have a uniform main battery, rather than having a few large guns complemented by a heavy secondary battery of smaller guns. She was also the first capital ship to be powered by steam turbines, making her the fastest battleship in the world at the time of her completion.Sturton, pp. 76–77 Her launch helped spark a naval arms race as navies around the world, particularly the German Imperial Navy rushed to match her in the build-up to World War I.
Dreadnought did not participate in any of World War I's naval battles as she was being refitted during the Battle of Jutland in 1916. This was the only time that British dreadnought battleships fired on their German counterparts during the war. She became the only battleship to sink a submarine when she rammed the [tpl]SMU|U-29|Germany|6[/tpl] when it unexpectedly broke the surface after firing a torpedo at another dreadnought in 1915. She was relegated to coastal defence duties in the English Channel after Jutland, only rejoining the Grand Fleet in 1918. She was reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later.

The competition was started by BBC Wales in 1983 to celebrate the opening of St David's Hall in Cardiff, Wales, home of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.  Auditions are held throughout the world in the autumn before the competition, with singers being selected to take part in Cardiff the following June. Each singer represents their own country. In Wales is there a competition to select the national representative.  The winner of the Welsh Singers Competition represents Wales in BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition.Welsh Singers Competition
The competition is judged by a panel of distinguished singers, musicians and music professionals. In 2003 an audience prize was also introduced for the primary competition; in 2011 it was renamed the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize to mark the passing of the legendary singer who was the competition's first patron.

Gordon's triangle model of inflation, the current inflation rate equals the sum of demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. "Demand-pull inflation" refers to the effects of falling unemployment rates (rising real gross domestic product) in the Phillips curve model, while the other two factors lead to shifts in the Phillips curve.
The built-in inflation originates from either persistent demand-pull or large cost-push (supply-shock) inflation in the past. It then becomes a "normal" aspect of the economy, via inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral.
In the end, built-in inflation involves a vicious circle of both subjective and objective elements, so that inflation encourages inflation to persist. It means that the standard methods of fighting inflation using monetary policy or fiscal policy to induce a recession are extremely expensive, i.e. they can cause large rises in unemployment and large falls in real gross domestic product. This suggests that alternative methods such as wage and price controls (incomes policies) may also be needed in the fight against inflation.

The Monosoupape (French for single-valve), was a rotary engine design first introduced in 1913 by Gnome Engine Company (since 1915 called Gnome et Rhône). It used a clever arrangement of internal transfer ports and a single pushrod-operated exhaust valve to replace a large number of moving parts found on more conventional rotary engines, and made the Monosoupape engines some of the most reliable of the era. British aircraft designer Thomas Sopwith described the Monosoupape as "one of the greatest single advances in aviation".[tpl]cite book | last = Nahum | first = Andrew | title = The Rotary Aero Engine | publisher = NMSI Trading Ltd | year = 1999 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-900747-12-X[/tpl]

[[Real versus nominal value (economics)]]

CATEGORIES: Basic financial concepts, Economics terminology, Inflation, Value

In economics a nominal value is an economic value expressed in monetary terms (that is, in units of a currency).  By contrast, a real value is a value that has been adjusted from a nominal value to remove the effects of general price level changes over time. For example, changes in the nominal value of some commodity bundle over time can happen because of a change in the quantities in the bundle or their associated prices, whereas changes in real values reflect only changes in quantities.
Real values are a measure of purchasing power net of any price changes over time. For example, nominal income is often restated as real income, thus removing that part of income changes that merely reflect inflation (a general increase in prices).  Similarly, for aggregate measures of output, such as gross domestic product (GDP), the nominal amount reflects production quantities and prices in that time period, whereas the differences between real amounts in different time periods reflect only changes in quantities. A series of real values over time, such as for real GDP, measures quantities over time expressed in prices of one year, called the base year (or more generally the base period). Real values in different years then express values of the bundles as if prices had been constant for all the years, with any differences due to differences in underlying quantities.
The nominal/real value distinction can apply not only to time-series data, as above, but also to cross-section data varying by region. For example, the total sales value of a particular good produced in a particular region of a country is influenced by both the physical amount sold and the selling price, which may be different from that of the country as a whole; for purposes of comparing the economic activity of different regions, the nominal output of the good in that region can be adjusted into real terms by repricing the goods at national-average prices.

It is the ninth largest river in the United States by average discharge volume at its mouth and seventeenth largest by basin drainage area.[tpl]cite web | last=Kammerer|first= J.C.| title = Largest Rivers in the United States| publisher = United States Geological Survey|year=1990| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/|accessdate=May 2, 2011[/tpl]
The river provides the principal drainage for an area of the remote Alaska Interior on the north and west side of the Alaska Range, flowing southwest into Kuskokwim Bay on the Bering Sea. Except for its headwaters in the mountains, the river is broad and flat for its entire course, making it a useful transportation route for many types of watercraft, as well as road vehicles during the winter when it is frozen over.[tpl]cite news|last=Johnson|first=Kirk|title=Health Care Is Spread Thin on Alaskan Frontier|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/us/health-care-in-vast-alaska-frontier-is-spread-thin.html?collection=health|accessdate=3 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 28, 2013[/tpl]  It is the longest free flowing river in the United States.
Kuskokwim is a loose transliteration of a Yupik language word. It is a compound word meaning big slow moving thing.
The Alaska Natives of Kuskokwim are Yup'ik Eskimo on the lower Kuskokwim, Deg Hit'an Athabaskan on the middle Kuskokwim, Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskan on the upper Kuskokwim, and Koyukon Athabaskan on the North Fork, Lake Minchumina.

[[Holger Voss]]
CATEGORIES: German Internet celebrities, Living people

Holger Voss is a German Internet user who was sued in January 2003 for a sarcastic comment pertaining to the September 11, 2001 attacks in an Internet discussion forum, a case that attracted nationwide attention in Germany. 
Voss's comment was originally made on June 21, 2002, during a discussion relating to an article in German net magazine Telepolis; it ended with the statement "If you find sarcasm, please reuse it" ("Wer Sarkasmus findet, der/die möge ihn bitte weiterverwenden"). Voss posted his comment in response to another poster's comment that endorsed the 9/11 attacks. http://www.heise.de/tp/foren/S-Da-trifft-es-mal-die-Richtigen/forum-30631/msg-1911553/read/ Voss also added a postscript to his comment, in which he remarked that he had added that original poster and another forum user to a blocklist, since he (Voss) ostensibly took their comments at face value and accused them of Volksverhetzung. (The original poster in turn accused Voss of being serious.)
Voss was subsequently charged, following an anonymous report to the police; he received a penalty order for an amount of 1500 euros, which he appealed, and was summoned to a court hearing on January 8, 2003, by the Münster county court. Voss was acquitted of the charge of assentingly accepting that an unbiased reader might interpret his statements as an approval of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the same day (cf. §140 StGB); during the course of the trial, it was also revealed that his disclaimer of the posting as sarcasm had been left out of the legal documents provided to the prosecutor by law enforcement agencies.
The case raised considerable attention in Germany, both for its free-speech implications and its implications regarding the liability of Internet forum providers for statements made by their members. Voss also claimed that Internet service provider T-Online saved his dynamic IP address, which was turned over to law enforcement agencies without a judge's order, for several months in disagreement with German laws (which only allow the saving of IP addresses for as long as is necessary for billing), and initiated legal action in a separate case, which he won on January 25, 2006.
On October 26, 2006, the BGH decided to refuse the complaint from T-Online, whereby the judgement from January 25, 2006 became law.

[[Telepolis]]

CATEGORIES: German magazines

Telepolis is the name of a German Internet magazine, published by the  Heinz Heise Verlag since the beginning of 1996. It was founded by journalists Armin Medosch and Florian Rötzer and deals with privacy, science, culture, internet-related and general politics and media. Other authors are Mathias Bröckers, Gabriele Hooffacker or Burkhard Schröder.
Telepolis received the European prize for online journalism in the category "investigative reporting" in 2000 for its coverage of the Echelon project; in 2002, it received the Online Grimme prize.
It periodically releases special issues, the first printed edition (01/2005) being on "Aliens - how researchers and space travellers want to uncover their presence." One of the articles in this edition, perhaps the most daring, described the so-called theory of everything (TOE) proposed by Burkhard Heim and its alleged applications to spacecraft propulsion.  (Heim theory is not part of mainstream physics, and few physicists would describe it as a TOE.)  Others deal with SETI and exobiology.

[[Heterophenomenology]]
CATEGORIES: Phenomenology, Philosophical methodology, Scientific method, Philosophy of mind

Heterophenomenology ("phenomenology of another not oneself") is a term coined by Daniel Dennett to describe an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of consciousness and other mental phenomena. It consists of applying the scientific method with an anthropological bent, combining the subject's self-reports with all other available evidence to determine their mental state. The goal is to discover how the subject sees the world him- or herself, without taking the accuracy of the subject's view for granted.
Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional Cartesian phenomenology, which Dennett calls "lone-wolf autophenomenology" to emphasize the fact that it accepts the subject's self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things seem to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather brackets it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence. 
The method requires a researcher to listen to the subjects and take what they say seriously, but to also look at everything else available to them, including the subject's bodily responses and environment, evidence provided by relevant neurological or psychological studies, the researcher's memories of their own experiences, and any other scientific data that might help to interpret what the subject has reported. 
Dennett notes this method is actually the normal way that anyone will choose to investigate aspects of the mind. He writes: "heterophenomenology is nothing new; it is nothing other than the method that has been used by psychophysicists, cognitive psychologists, clinical neuropsychologists, and just about everybody who has ever purported to study human consciousness in a serious, scientific way."[tpl]sfn|Dennett|2003|p=22[/tpl]
The key role of heterophenomenology in Dennett's philosophy of consciousness is that it defines all that can or needs to be known about the mind. For any phenomenological question "why do I experience X", there is a corresponding heterophenomenological question "why does the subject say 'I experience X'". To quote Dennett, "The total set of details of heterophenomenology, plus all the data we can gather about concurrent events in the brains of subjects and in the surrounding environment, comprise the total data set for a theory of human consciousness. It leaves out no objective phenomena and no subjective phenomena of consciousness."[tpl]sfn|Dennett|2003|p=20[/tpl]

[[Solidarity Party]]

CATEGORIES: United States regional and state political parties, Politics of Illinois, Political parties established in 1986, 1986 establishments in Illinois

The Solidarity Party was an American political party in the state of Illinois.  It was named after Lech Wałęsa's Solidarity movement in Poland, which was widely-admired in Illinois at the time (Illinois has a very large Polish American population, especially around Chicago).
The party was founded in 1986 by Senator Adlai Stevenson III in reaction to the Democratic Party's nomination of two followers of Lyndon LaRouche in the race for high state offices.  These candidates were Mark Fairchild, who was running for Lieutenant Governor, and Janice Hart, who was running for Illinois Secretary of State.  Stevenson, a Democratic Gubernatorial candidate, did not want to run alongside anybody associated with LaRouche's organization.  
There are a number of explanations as to how the LaRouche followers became nominees.  Some believe that it simply boiled down to the names of the LaRouche candidates, which sounded less "ethnic" than those of their opponents George E. Sangmeister and Aurelia Pucinski. Hart's victory over Pucinski was likely helped by a voter reaction to Pucinski, whose father, Roman Pucinski, was a prominent opponent of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. 
Many criticized the Democrats for their failure to inform voters exactly who the candidates were, and this allowed campaigning efforts in rural areas to be very effective.  "LaRouche Democrats" claimed that the Democratic Party (especially chairman Charles Manatt) was under the influence of Mikhail Gorbachev.  LaRouche maintains that the population voted for his followers to take the party back from elitist bankers.  In any case, most analysts (including Stevenson himself) agreed that the whole ordeal confused voters, helping Republican James R. Thompson win the election.  The "Solidarity Democrats" and the LaRouche supporters blame one another for the subsequent years of Republican control in Illinois state government. Stevenson left politics and went on to become an investment banker.  
The Solidarity Party continued to exist (completely unaffiliated with Stevenson) after the 1986 incident.  This made it an easy target for other small political parties to "take over" when necessary.  One such group was the New Alliance Party (NAP), which was largely unknown in Illinois but still managed to run some of its candidates for local offices.
NAP founder Lenora Fulani campaigned as a Solidarity Party presidential candidate in 1988 and 1992.  This is interesting because Fulani works closely with Fred Newman, a former affiliate of LaRouche who broke from the National Caucus of Labor Committees to start his own political activities.

Eustathius of Antioch, sometimes surnamed the Great, was a bishop and patriarch of Antioch in the 4th century.
He was a native of Side in Pamphylia. About 320 he was bishop of Beroea, and he became patriarch of Antioch shortly before the Council of Nicaea in 325. In that assembly he distinguished himself zealously against the Arians, though the Allocutio ad Imperatorem with which he has been credited is hardly genuine.
His anti–Arian polemic against Eusebius of Caesarea made him unpopular among his fellow bishops in the East, and a synod convened at Antioch in 330 deposed him for adultery,Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 2, chapter 7. which was confirmed by the emperor.
For instance, in the dispute with Eustathius of Antioch, who opposed the growing influence of Origen and his practice of an allegorical exegesis of scripture, seeing in his theology the roots of Arianism, Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith, who was charged in turn with Sabellianism. Eustathius was accused, condemned, and deposed at a synod in Antioch. The people of Antioch rebelled against this action, while the anti-Eustathians proposed Eusebius as the new bishop, but he declined. He was banished to Trajanopolis in Thrace, where he died, probably about 337, though possibly not until 370.[tpl]cite web|last=Socrates Scholasticus|title=Ecclesiastical History|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.vii.xiv.html[/tpl] 
The only complete work by Eustathius is the De Engastrimytho contra Origenem (ed. by A. Jahn in Texte und Untersuchungen, ii. 4; J. H. Declerck in Corpus Christianorum - Series Graeca no. 51, 2002), which discusses the episode of the Witch of Endor in 1 Samuel. Other fragments are enumerated by G. F. Loofs in Herzog-Hauck’s Realencyklopädie.
The Commentary on the Hexameron attributed to him in the manuscripts is not authentic.

[[Ex parte Endo]]
CATEGORIES: United States Supreme Court cases, Japanese American internment, 1944 in United States case law, Suspension Clause case law

Ex parte Endo, or Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944),[tpl]ussc|323|283|Full text of the decision courtesy of Findlaw.com[/tpl] was a United States Supreme Court decision, handed down on December 18, 1944, the same day as their decision in Korematsu v. United States. In their decision, the Supreme Court ruled that, regardless of whether the United States Government had a right to exclude people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast during World War II, they could not continue to detain a citizen that the government itself conceded was loyal to the United States. This decision helped lead to the re-opening of the West Coast for resettlement by Japanese-American citizens following their internment in camps across the United States during World War II.
Mitsuye Endo, the plaintiff in the case, was evacuated from Sacramento, California, in 1942, pursuant to Executive Order 9066 and was removed to the Tule Lake War Relocation Center located in Modoc County, California. In July 1942, she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, asking that she be discharged and restored to liberty. That petition was denied by the District Court in July 1943, and an appeal was perfected to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1943.
The court also found as part of this decision that if Congress is found to have ratified by appropriation any part of an executive agency program, the bill doing so must include a specific item referring to that portion of the program.
The unanimous opinion was written by William O. Douglas, with Frank Murphy and Owen Roberts concurring.
It is very difficult to reconcile Endo with Korematsu, which was decided the same day.  As Justice Roberts pointed out in his Korematsu dissent, distinguishing the cases required relying on the legal fiction that Korematsu only dealt with the exclusion of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast, not their detention – as though Mr. Korematsu could have gone anywhere else in the United States.  In reality, he would have been subjected to the detention found illegal in Endo.  In short, Korematsu held that the Government could criminally punish someone for refusing to be illegally imprisoned.

Pedro Pablo Ramirez Machuca (January 30, 1884 – May 12, 1962) was de facto President of Argentina from June 7, 1943 to February 24, 1944. He was the founder and leader of Guardia Nacional, Argentina's Fascist militia.Current Biography 1943, p. 608 
After graduating from the Argentine military college in 1904 as a second lieutenant, Ramírez was promoted in 1910 as first lieutenant of the cavalry. In 1911, he was sent to Germany for training with the Fifth Hussars cavalry in Kaiser Wilhelm's Prussian Army. He returned home in 1913, with a German wife, and prior to the outbreak of World War One.Current Biography 1943, pp. 608-611 Advancing in rank as a specialist in cavalry tactics, he assisted fellow General José Félix Uriburu in a fascist coup that deposed Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1930. Ramírez was sent to Rome to observe Mussolini's army until his return in 1932.  
When Uriburu set free elections and was voted out of office, General Ramírez worked behind the scenes to plan a return of fascism to Argentina. Over the next several years, he organized the Milicia Nacionalista (later the Guardia), and authored a program for a state ruled by the militia. In 1942, Ramírez was appointed as War Minister by President Ramón Castillo, and began to reorganize the Argentine Army. At the same time, the Guardia Nacional joined with another party to form "Recuperacion Nacional," a fascist political party. Castillo fired Ramírez following a cabinet meeting on May 18, 1943. Two weeks later, on June 4, 1943, Ramírez assisted Arturo Rawson in overthrowing Castillo's government, and was again made Minister of War. Three days later, on June 7 Ramírez forced Rawson's resignation and maintained Argentina's neutrality during World War II. Argentina was torn by then between Britain, who wanted the country to stay neutral, and the US, who wanted it to join the Allies. Ramírez stayed neutral and, consequently, the United States refused requests for Lend-Lease aid. Argentina finally declared war on Germany and Japan during the government of Edelmiro Farrell.
Despite having been brought to power through a coup d'état, Peronist historiography never calls him a dictator.Mendelevich, p. 147

Ramón S. Castillo Barrionuevo (November 20, 1873 – October 12, 1944) was a conservative Argentine politician who served as President of Argentina from June 27, 1942 to June 4, 1943. He was a leading figure in the period known as the Infamous Decade characterised by electoral fraud, corruption and rule by conservative landowners heading the alliance known as the Concordancia. 
Castillo graduated in law from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and began a judicial career. He reached the Appeals Chamber of commercial law before retiring and dedicating himself to teaching. He was professor and dean at UBA between 1923 and 1928. 
Castillo was named Federal Intervenor of Tucumán Province in 1930. From 1932 until 1935 he was elected to the Argentine Senate for Catamarca Province for the National Democratic Party and was also Minister of Interior.
From 1938 to 1942, Castillo was vice-president of Argentina under President Roberto Ortiz, who won the election by fraud at the head of the Concordancia. He served as acting president from August 12, 1940 to June 27, 1942 due to the illness of President Ortiz, who did not resign until less than a month before his death. Castillo maintained Argentina's neutrality during World War II. He was overthrown in the Revolution of '43 military coup in the midst of an unpopular attempt to impose Robustiano Patrón Costas as his successor. Juan Domingo Perón was a junior officer in the coup.

Sir John Chandos, Viscount of Saint-Sauveur in the Cotentin, Constable of Aquitaine, Seneschal of Poitou, KG (c.1320 — 31 December 1369) was a medieval English knight who hailed from Radbourne Hall, Derbyshire. Chandos was a close friend of Edward, the Black Prince and a founding member and 19th Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. Chandos was a gentleman by birth, but unlike most commanders of the day he held no title of nobility.
Described by the medieval historian Froissart as "wise and full of devices", as a military strategist Chandos is believed to have been the mastermind behind three of the most  important English victories of the Hundred Years War: the Battle of Crecy, the Battle of Poitiers and the Battle of Auray. His death in a minor skirmish was regretted by both sides.

[[Ghost condensate]]
CATEGORIES: Particle physics

In particle physics, a ghost condensate is a speculative proposal in which a ghost, an excitation of a field with a wrong sign of the kinetic term, acquires a vacuum expectation value. This phenomenon breaks Lorentz invariance spontaneously. Around the new vacuum state, all excitations have a positive norm, and therefore the probabilities are positive definite.
We have a real scalar field φ with the following action
where a and b are positive constants and
in the +--- sign convention.
The theories of ghost condensate predict specific non-Gaussianities of the cosmic microwave background. These theories have been proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Markus Luty, and others.
Unfortunately, this theory allows for superluminal propagation of information in some cases and has no lower bound on its energy. This model doesn't admit a Hamiltonian formulation (the Legendre transform is multi-valued because the momentum function isn't convex) because it is acausal. Quantizing this theory leads to problems.

Jaime Gerardo Roberto Marcelino María Ortiz Lizardi (September 24, 1886 – July 15, 1942) was President of Argentina from February 20, 1938 to June 27, 1942.
Ortiz was born in Buenos Aires. As a student at the University of Buenos Aires, he participated in an unsuccessful revolution in 1905. In 1909 he graduated from the university and became a lawyer. 
He became active in the Radical Civic Union and was elected to the Argentine National Congress in 1920. He served as minister of public works from 1925 to 1928. He supported the revolution of 1930 and served as treasury minister from 1935 to 1937. 
In the presidential elections of 1937, he was the official government candidate and won, though the opposition accused him of participating in fraud, as irregularities were widespread. Ortiz never denied those charges but once he took office he tried to make Argentine politics more open and truly democratic. Soon after becoming president, Ortiz became seriously ill with diabetes and in August 1940, he gave up his powers to vice-president Ramón Castillo. He was pro-Ally but because of opposition in the army, he didn't break relations with the Axis. He resigned a few weeks before his death.

Agustín Pedro Justo Rolón (February 26, 1876 – January 11, 1943) was President of Argentina from February 20, 1932, to February 20, 1938. He was a military officer, diplomat, and politician, and was president during the Infamous Decade.
Appointed War Minister by President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, his experience under a civilian administration and pragmatic outlook earned him the conservative Concordance's nomination for the 1931 campaign. He was elected president on November 8, 1931, supported by the political sectors that would form shortly after la Concordancia, an alliance created between the National Democratic Party (Partido Demócrata Nacional), the Radical Civic Union (Unión Cívica Radical) (UCR), and the Socialist Independent Party (Partido Socialista Independiente).  Around the elections there were accusations of electoral fraud, nevertheless, the name patriotic fraud was used for a system of control established from 1931 to 1943. Conservative groups wanted to use this to prevent any radicals from coming to power. During this period there was persistent opposition from the supporters of Yrigoyen, an earlier president, and from the Radical Civic Union.
The outstanding diplomatic work of his Foreign Minister, Carlos Saavedra Lamas, was one of the greatest accomplishments of his administration, stained by constant accusations of corruption and of delivering the national economy into the hands of foreign interests, the British in particular, with whom his vice-president Julio A. Roca, Jr. had signed the Roca-Runciman Treaty.  His name was mentioned as a candidate a new period during the unsteady government of Ramón Castillo, but his early death at 66 thwarted his plans. He worked on a preliminary study for the complete works of Bartolomé Mitre, whom he admired profoundly.
Justo took part in the coup of 1930, becoming president two years later thanks to widespread electoral fraud. His presidency was part of the period known as the Infamous Decade, which lasted from 1930 until 1943. He established the country's central bank and introduced a nationwide income tax.

Lieutenant General José Félix Benito Uriburu y Uriburu (1868–1932) was the first de facto President of Argentina; he achieved the position through a military coup, and his tenure lasted from September 6, 1930, to February 20, 1932.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Uriburu Ends Argentine Rule |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OLpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1WkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5926,2002585&dq=uriburu&hl=en |quote=The General who strode into the Argentine capital almost a year and a half ago and took over the government by threat of arms, tomorrow will stride out in favor of a ... |newspaper=Associated Press |date=February 20, 1932 |accessdate=2011-04-26 [/tpl] 
Uriburu was born in Salta Province, and was a nephew of President José Evaristo Uriburu. He graduated from the military college in 1890. Prior to World War I, he served as military attache to Germany and the United Kingdom. When he returned to Argentina in 1914, he was elected to the Argentine National Congress. He was appointed inspector general of the army by Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear in 1922.
In September 1930, he led a military coup against democratically-elected President Hipólito Yrigoyen, in which the far-right Argentine Patriotic League participated. The coup marked the start of what was later called the Infamous Decade. His regime was strongly supported by rightist intellectuals such as Rodolfo and Julio Irazusta and Juan Carulla.
He stayed as head of the government until 1932, implementing several reforms including cutting of government employees' salaries by more than 10 percent. 
After being diagnosed with stomach cancer in early 1932, he endured a brief period of futile recovery before dying in Paris, France on 29 April 1932.

Records artists

The Beau Brummels were an American rock band. Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart—later known as Sly Stone—produced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to The Beatles, while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.
The Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, "Laugh, Laugh," for which they would later be credited for setting one of the aesthetic foundations for the San Francisco Sound, along with other bands such as The Charlatans; the song is in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list, "The 660 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".http://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/ The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing the Beau Brummels, and the Top 10 single "Just a Little." The group's commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, Beau Brummels '66, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: Triangle in 1967 and Bradley's Barn in 1968.
The band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record Bradley's Barn before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. Four of the original Beau Brummels reformed in 1974 with one new member and the band released an eponymous album the following year.

In physical cosmology, the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background are known to be approximately Gaussian, both theoretically as well as experimentally. However, most theories predict some level of non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field. Detection of these non-Gaussian signatures will allow discrimination between various models of inflation and their alternatives.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting from a defect in the gene CYP17A1, which encodes for the enzyme  17α-hydroxylase. It produces decreased synthesis of both cortisol and sex steroids, with resulting increase in mineralocorticoid production. Thus, common symptoms include mild hypocortisolism, ambiguous genitalia in genetic males or failure of the ovaries to function at puberty in genetic females, and hypertension (respectively).

The Apostolic Age of the history of Christianity is traditionally the period of the Twelve Apostles, dating from the Great Commission of the Apostles by the resurrected Jesus in Jerusalem c. 33 until the death of the last Apostle, believed to be John the Apostle in Anatolia c. 100.  Traditionally, the Apostles are believed to have dispersed from Jerusalem,Catholic Encyclopedia: Dispersion of the Apostles: "The object of the feast (so Godescalcus) is to commemorate the departure (dispersion) of the Apostles from Jerusalem for the various parts of the world, some fourteen years after the Ascension of Christ." founding the Apostolic Sees. It holds special significance in Christian tradition as the age of the direct apostles of Jesus Christ. The major primary source for the "Apostolic Age" is the Acts of the Apostles, but its historical accuracy is questioned by some.
According to most scholars,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] the followers of Jesus were composed principally from apocalyptic Jewish sects during the late Second Temple period of the 1st century. Some Early Christian groups were strictly Jewish, such as the Ebionites and the early-church leaders in Jerusalem, collectively called Jewish Christians. During this period, they were led by James the Just. Paul of Tarsus, commonly known as Saint Paul, persecuted the early Jewish Christians, such as Saint Stephen, then converted and adopted the title of "Apostle to the Gentiles" and started proselytizing among the Gentiles. He persuaded the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow Gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which may parallel Noahide Law in Rabbinic Judaism.
According to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Paul's influence on Christian thinking is more significant than any other New Testament author,Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church ed. F.L. Lucas (Oxford) entry on Paul however the relationship of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism is still disputed today (see the link for details). After the Destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70 during the First Jewish-Roman War, or at the latest following the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132, Jerusalem ceased to be the center of the Christian church, its bishops became "suffragans" (subordinates) of the Metropolitan bishop of Caesarea.Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (A.D. 71-1099): "As the rank..." In the 2nd century, Christianity established itself as a predominantly Gentile religion that spanned the Roman Empire and beyond.

[[Spoiler (aeronautics)]]

CATEGORIES: Aircraft controls, Aircraft wing components

In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes called a lift dumper) is a device intended to reduce lift in an aircraft.  Spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil it.  By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over the portion of the wing behind it, greatly reducing the lift of that wing section.  Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without regard to affecting the lift, while spoilers reduce lift as well as increase drag.
Spoilers fall into two categories: those that are deployed at controlled angles during flight to increase descent rate or control roll, and those that are fully deployed immediately on landing to greatly reduce lift ("lift dumpers") and increase drag. In modern fly-by-wire aircraft, the same set of spoilers serve in both functions.
Spoilers are used by nearly every glider (sailplane) to control their rate of descent and thus achieve a controlled landing at a desired spot. An increased rate of descent can also be achieved by lowering the nose of an aircraft, but this would result in an excessive landing speed. Spoilers enable the approach to be made at a safe speed for landing.
Airliners are almost always fitted with spoilers. Spoilers are used to assist descent to lower altitudes without picking up speed. Their use is often limited, however, as the turbulent airflow that develops behind them causes noise and vibration, which may cause discomfort to passengers. Spoilers may also be differentially operated for roll control instead of ailerons; Martin Aircraft was the first company to develop such spoilers in 1948."Spoilers Aid Aileron Control." Popular Science, August 1948, p. 91. On landing, however, the spoilers are nearly always used at full effect to help slow the aircraft.  The increase in form drag created by the spoilers directly assists the braking effect.  However, the real gain comes as the spoilers cause a dramatic loss of lift and hence the weight of the aircraft is transferred from the wings to the undercarriage, allowing the wheels to be mechanically braked with less tendency to skid. (Reverse thrust is also often used to help slow the aircraft on landing.)
In air-cooled piston engine aircraft, spoilers may be needed to avoid shock cooling the engines.  In a descent without spoilers, air speed is increased and the engine will be at low power, producing less heat than normal.  The engine may cool too rapidly, resulting in stuck valves, cracked cylinders or other problems. Spoilers alleviate the situation by allowing the aircraft to descend at a desired rate while letting the engine run at a power setting that keeps it from cooling too quickly. (This is particularly true for turbocharged piston engines, which generate higher temperatures than normally aspirated engines.)

Te Urewera National Park is one of 14 national parks within New Zealand and is the largest of the four in the North Island. Covering an area of approximately 2,127 km², it is in the north east of the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island.
On 28 July 1954, the catchment areas of Lake Waikaremoana, Lake Waikareiti and other Crown reserves were gazetted as a national park, and by 1957 proposals were well underway to add the rest of the Crown land in Te Urewera north of Ruatahuna. This proposal was formalised in November 1957 when an additional 1,350 km² were added. Further additions were made in 1962, 1975 and 1979, with smaller acquisitions and boundary alterations in the intervening period. 
The lake bed and Māori enclaves were not included in the park gazetting. The Crown has leased the lake bed, which is managed by the Department of Conservation.
Te Urewera is the traditional home of the Tuhoe people. Due to its geographical isolation, it was one of the last regions to be claimed by the British during colonisation in the 19th century. Te Kooti, the Māori leader, found refuge there from his pursuers among Tuhoe, with whom he formed an alliance.
In March 2013, Tuhoe signed a deed of settlement, settling the tribe's claims at the Waitangi Tribunal. Under the deal, Tuhoe will get $170 million and more control over Urewera National Park.

The park's name comes from the Māori words ure meaning penis and wera meaning burnt, thus, the literal translation from Māori is "burnt penis" (National Park). The name comes from a historical event, passed down through maori oral tradition, of a chief several centuries ago who died while out with a hunting party in the forests of the present-day park. He rolled over in his sleep while lying too close to a camp fire, badly burning his groin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

Real Presence is a term used in various Christian traditions to express belief that in the Eucharist, Jesus Christ is really present in what was previously just bread and wine, and not merely present in symbol, a figure of speech (metaphorically, common amongst the Radical Reformers and their descendants), or by his power (dynamically), or by the grace of the Holy Spirit in the individual believer partaking of the species (pneumatically, common amongst Reformed believers).
Not all Christian traditions accept this doctrine.  Efforts at mutual understanding of the range of beliefs led in 1980s to consultations on Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry (BEM) through the World Council of Churches, consultations that included the Catholic Church.

[[Trail running]]
CATEGORIES: Running, Trail running

Trail running is a sport which consists of running and hiking over trails. In the United Kingdom and Irish Republic it is called mountain or fell running. It differs from road running and track running in that generally takes place on hiking trails, often in mountainous terrain, where there can be much larger ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish trail running from cross country running. In general, however, cross country is an IAAF governed discipline that is typically raced over shorter distances (rarely over 12 kilometers), whereas trail running is loosely governed, and run over longer routes. 
The ranks of trail runners are increasing annually. They have grown from 4.5 million to more than 6 million in the United States alone between 2006 and 2012.OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTICIPATION STUDY 2013 - http://www.outdoorindustry.org/images/researchfiles/ParticipationStudy2013.pdf The amount of organized trail races has grown exponentially over the past few years throughout the world, now well into the hundreds in North America alone.See http://www.ultramarathonrunning.com/races/ Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running.http://www.runnersworld.com/trail-running-training/why-trail-running-is-good-for-you?page=single This move to nature is also reflected in a large increase in competitors in non-traditional/off-road triathlons and adventure racing over the past five years.http://www.outdoorindustry.org/images/researchfiles/ParticipationStudy2013.pdf?193

Roque Sáenz Peña Lahitte (March 19, 1851 – August 9, 1914) was President of Argentina from 12 October 1910 to  9 August 1914, when he died in office. He was the son of former President Luis Sáenz Peña.
He was responsible for passing Law 8871, known as "Sáenz Peña Law", which greatly reformed the Argentine electoral system, making the vote secret, universal and compulsory for males over 18. This effectively ended the rule by electoral fraud of the conservative Argentine oligarchy, and paved the way for the rise of the Radical Civic Union in the first free elections of the country. President Roque Sáenz Peña Avenue in Buenos Aires is named after him.
He also served in the War of the Pacific as a lieutenant colonel of the Peruvian Army, and was made prisoner by Chile for six months following the Battle of Arica. He later served as Ambassador to Spain (1906-1907) and Italy (1907-1910)
His daughter married Carlos Saavedra Lamas, academic and politician, and the first Latin American Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

[[Safety curtain]]
CATEGORIES: Stage terminology, Fly system, Parts of a theatre, Safety equipment

A safety curtain (or fire curtain in America) is a fire safety precaution used in large proscenium theatres. It is usually a heavy fibreglass or iron curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch.  Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were discovered. The safety curtain is sometimes referred to as an iron in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.
Occupational safety and health regulations state that the safety curtain must be able to resist fire and thereby prevent (or at least hinder) fires starting on stage from spreading to the auditorium and the rest of the theatre, reducing injuries to audience members and members of staff.
The curtain is extremely heavy and therefore requires its own dedicated operating mechanisms. In an emergency, the stage manager can usually pull a lever backstage which will cause the curtain to fall rapidly into position. Alternatively, heat-sensitive components can be built into the rigging to automatically close this curtain in case of fire.  Finally, it may be released electronically by a building's fire control system if any alarm box is operated. It can also be flown in and out, as regulations in some jurisdictions state that it must be shown to the audience, to prove its effective operation, for a certain amount of time during every performance. This usually occurs during the intermission.
In smaller theatres, a safety curtain is not usually required. Specifically, most United States building codes only require a fire curtain in theatres with a stage height of more than [tpl]convert|50|ft|m[/tpl]. 2006 International Building Code, 410.3.4, pg. 51 The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation.
In the UK, it is a requirement that a safety curtain must be fully down within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain.http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre Several other serious fires, notably that at the Theatre Royal, Exeter in 1887, led to the introduction of safety curtains on a wider scale.

[[Circulating capital]]

CATEGORIES: Classical economics, Capital (economics)

Circulating capital includes intermediate goods and operating expenses, i.e., short-lived items that are used in production and used up in the process of creating other goods or services.Mark Blaug, 2008. "circulating capital,"   The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition.  Abstract. This is roughly equal to intermediate consumption. Finer distinction include raw materials, intermediate goods, inventories, ancillary operating expenses and (working capital). It is contrasted with fixed capital. The term was used in more specialized ways by classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx.
Where the distinction is used, circulating capital is a component of (total) capital, also including fixed capital used in a single cycle of production. In contrast to fixed capital, it is used up  in every cycle (raw materials, basic and intermediate materials, combustible, energy…). In accounting, the circulating capital comes under the heading of current assets.
Building on the work of Quesnay and Turgot, Adam Smith (1776) made the first explicit distinction between fixed and circulating capital. In his usage, circulating capital includes wages and labour maintenance, money, and inputs from land, mines, and fisheries associated with production.Adam Smith, 1776. Wealth of Nations, Books II, ch. 1, 2, and 5.
According to Karl Marx (second volume of Das Kapital, end of chapter 7) the turnover of capital influences "the processes of production and self-expansion", the two new forms of capital, circulating and fixed, "accrue to capital from the process of circulation and affect the form of its turnover". In the following chapter Marx defines fixed capital and circulating capital. In chapter 9 he claims: "We have here not alone quantitative but also qualitative difference."  
Conventionally, (physical) capital assets held by a business for more than one year are regarded in annual accounting statements as "fixed", the rest as "circulating". In modern economies such as the United States, roughly half of the intermediate inputs bought or used by businesses are in fact services, and not goods.

[[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]

CATEGORIES: Dopamine reuptake inhibitors, Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, Drugs acting on the nervous system

A dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) is a type of drug that acts as a reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitter dopamine by blocking the action of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Reuptake inhibition is achieved when extracellular dopamine not absorbed by the post-synaptic neuron is blocked from re-entering the pre-synaptic neuron. This, in turn, leads to increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine and therefore an increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission.[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=Hai-Ying Zhang, Xia Li, Guo-Hua Bi, Eliot L. Gardner, Zheng-Xiong Xi|title=Increased vulnerability to cocaine in mice lacking dopamine D3 receptors|journal=PNAS|date=5 September 2012|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi10.1073/pnas.1205297109|author=Rui Song[/tpl]
DRIs are frequently used in the treatment of conditions like ADHD and narcolepsy on account of their psychostimulant effects and in the treatment of obesity due to their appetite suppressant properties. They have also been used as antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders, but their use for this indication has been limited on account of their abuse potential and legal restriction. Lack of dopamine uptake and the increase in extracellular levels of dopamine have been linked to increased susceptibility to addictive behavior due to the increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission. The dopaminergic pathways are considered to be strong reward centers.  In addition, many DRIs such as cocaine are drugs of abuse due to the rewarding effects evoked by elevated synaptic concentrations of dopamine in the brain.
Due to their strong rewarding and reinforcing properties, DRIs are notorious for their high abuse potential and liability to cause cravings, addiction, and dependence.[tpl]Dubious|date=June 2010[/tpl] DRIs such as cocaine and methylphenidate and combination releasing agents such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA ("ecstasy") are widely used recreationally throughout the world.

Retrieved on November 25, 2009. is a British archaeologist most well known for his studies into megalithic monuments and the nature of prehistoric rituals associated with them.  Before retirement he was Principal Lecturer in Archaeology, Hull College, East Riding of Yorkshire.

ISBN 978-0-7509-1598-4 He has been called by The New York Times, "the leading authority on British stone circles"."MagicStones: Prehistoric Avebury" by Paul Johnspon The New York Times Book Review, Page BR3, October 21, 1979    link
Burl's work, while considering the astronomical roles of many megalithic monuments, is cautious of embracing the more tenuous claims of archaeoastronomy.Burl, Aubrey. Great Stone Circles: Fables, Fictions, Facts[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] In 'Prehistoric Avebury' Burl proposes that Circles and Henge monuments, far from being astronomical observatories for a class of 'astronomer priests' were more likely used for ritualistic practices, connected with death and fertility rites, and ancestor worship, similar to practices observed in other agricultural cultures (in particular the rituals of Native North American Tribes such as the Algonquin and the Pawnee). Rituals would have been performed at key times of the year, such as the Spring Equinox and Summer Solstice, to ensure a successful harvest from the land.[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
His approach led him to question what he sees as the over-romanticised view that Stonehenge was built from bluestones hauled by hand from the Preseli Hills in south west Wales to Salisbury Plain. Rather, the stones were left close to the site by earlier glaciers and then exploited by the monument's builders Burl, Aubrey. The Stone Circles of the British Isles.[tpl]synthesis-inline|date=July 2011[/tpl] Others have argued that the bluestones have been traced to only the Preselli Hills through their chemical signature and that they could not have come from elsewhere. Additionally, it was claimed that there was no known glacier with a course linking the hills with Salisbury Plain or a glacier from anywhere that reached far enough south. On the other hand, recent research by earth scientists shows that glacier ice reached the Scilly Isles on at least one occasion and that ice which crossed Pembrokeshire did cross the coasts of Somerset and Devon.Burl, Aubrey. 2001.

[[Saab Formula Junior]]
CATEGORIES: Saab vehicles, Front-wheel-drive vehicles, Formula Junior cars

The Saab Formula Junior was a car built in 1960 by the Swedish car maker Saab.
In 1960, the Saab 93f was being replaced by the Saab 96 and a new 841 cc engine was developed. The competition and testing departments of Saab did not want to see any series produced sports engines with the new size until they had a chance to try some new ideas. These ideas led to the creation of these Formula Junior race cars with which Saab surprised the motor racing world in the late autumn of 1960. The cars first showed up at the Gelleråsen racetrack at Karlskoga and then at the Eläintarhanajot race in Helsinki (Finland), in 1961, finishing 4th and 5th.
The body design was unusual. Instead of using a multi-tubular spaceframe chassis like other Formula Junior cars, Saab chose to construct an advanced aluminium monocoque car, with a plastic nose-cone.
The fibreglass nose protected a 'bored-out' horizontal 950 cc three cylinder two stroke engine, with two dual Solex carburettors developing some 95 bhp - (one of the carburettors was cut in half, thus providing three chokes — one for each of the three cylinders). There was a cross-flow radiator, for cooling. The suspension was purpose-built, incorporating a unique type of tensile spring. The cars did not do very well in races, due to their cornering ability and their relatively low-powered engine (the later regulations allowed up to 1100 cc engines). Nonetheless, two first places and a track record (Stockholm) were achieved. The 70%-30% front-rear weight distribution created pronounced understeer. This was only partially overcome by designing the rear suspension to encourage the inside rear wheel to lift during cornering. Only two cars were built, as later regulations made them even less competitive. They were retired at the end of the 1961 racing season. History records them as having fulfilled an important developmental role for Saab's competition department.
The cars appeared in typical Swedish livery of blue and yellow. The drivers were Gösta Karlsson, Carl-Magnus Skogh and Erik Carlsson.

Barrio Bellavista (Bellavista Neighborhood) is an area that lies between the Mapocho River and San Cristóbal Hill in Santiago, Chile. It is known as Santiago's bohemian quarter, with new hip restaurants, boutiques, and avant-garde galleries occupying loft spaces and lordly mansions that punctuate tree-lined streets awash with colorful antique homes. Many of the city's esteemed intellectuals and artists live in Bellavista, following in the footsteps of its most famous denizen, Pablo Neruda. In the evening, Bellavista pulses to the beat of music pouring from its many discos and bars. On weekends, there is an evening handicrafts market that runs the length of Pío Nono. The area is served by the Baquedano Metro subway station, located just across the river.http://www.frommers.com/destinations/santiago/2320026512.html
In addition, it is a popular place to purchase craftwork made from lapis lazuli, a semiprecious stone found principally in Chile and Afghanistan. 
Pablo Neruda's famous house in Santiago, La Chascona, is also in this quarter.
Another attraction is the Santa Filomena Parish also known as the Parroquia de Santa Filomena.

She was the first woman elected to Congress from Ohio.Rep. Frances P. Bolton dies, March 9, 1977 - Andrew Glass - POLITICO.com In the late 1930s Bolton took an isolationist position on foreign policy, opposing the Selective Service Act (the draft) in 1940, and opposing Land-Lease in 1941.  During the war she called for desegregation of the military nursing units, which were all-white and all-female.  In 1947 she sponsored a long-range bill for nursing education, but it did not pass.  When the draft was resumed after the war, Bolton strongly advocated the conscription of women.  Pointing to their prominent role during the war, she said it was vitally important that women can it continue to play these essential roles.  She saw no threat to marriage, and argued that women in military service would develop their character and skills, thus enhancing their role in the family.

Raiden is a fictional character from Konami's Metal Gear series. Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa, Raiden was introduced in the series as the main player character of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. In Metal Gear Solid 2, he appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit FOXHOUND, participating in his first mission. Despite coming across as rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian child soldier. Raiden reappears as a supporting character in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and returns as the main character of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance dealing both with his past and his present life as a combatant. 
The idea of creating Raiden originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view the Metal Gear series protagonist Solid Snake from a different point of view, inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories. Raiden's inclusion remained a secret to gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked his character. Raiden's debut role as the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid 2 became controversial for two reasons: the unexpected substitution of the established hero Solid Snake and Raiden's androgynous appearance. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more in his role and design in Revengeance.

[[Marotte]]

CATEGORIES: Regalia

A marotte is a prop stick or sceptre with a carved head on it. The word is borrowed from the French, where it signifies either a fool's (literal) "bauble", or a fad/craze.
Typically carried by a jester or harlequin, the miniature head will often reflect the costume of the jester who carries it. Modern marottes typically have music boxes or other machinery built into the head. Older marottes may utilize swivel heads with bells.
In the children's TV series Rentaghost, the stick was referred to as a "Tiny Timothy".
In Verdi's opera Rigoletto, the singer of the title-role—who is a jester—carries a marotte, which often has on it the faces of comedy and tragedy.

Each magazine is devoted to only the shows on the network the edition covers and is published biweekly.
The NBC edition was discontinued after only two years in 1999 after NBC's cancellation and non-replacement of Another World on their daytime schedule, making it superfluous to cover only two programs, while the ABC and CBS editions continue to be sold.

Alejandro Vicente López y Planes (May 3, 1785 – October 10, 1856) was an Argentine writer and politician who acted as interim President of Argentina from July 7, 1827 to August 18, 1827. He also wrote the lyrics of the Argentine National Anthem adopted on May 11, 1813.
López began his primary studies in the San Francisco School, and later studied in the Real Colegio San Carlos, today the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires.  He obtained a doctorate of laws in the University of Chuquisaca.  He served as a captain in the Patriotic Regiment during the English invasions.  After the Argentine victory he composed a poem entitled El triunfo argentino (The Argentine Triumph).  He participated in the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810 and supported the formation of the Primera Junta.  He had good relations with Manuel Belgrano.  When the royalist members of the city government of Buenos Aires were expulsed, he was elected mayor of the city; he was an enemy of the party of Cornelio Saavedra and one of the creators of the First Triumvirate, of which he was the Treasurer.
López was a member of the Constituent Assembly of year XIII, representing Buenos Aires.  At the request of the Assembly, he wrote the lyrics to a "patriotic march", which eventually became the Argentine National Anthem.  It was a military march, whose music was composed by the Catalan Blas Parera; it was approved on March 11, 1813.  The first public reading was at a tertulia on May 7 in the house of Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson.  It displaced a different march, written by  Esteban de Luca, which would have been the hymn if not for the more militaristic Lopez.
López participated in the government of Carlos María de Alvear, and with his fall he was sent to prison.  He held a few more public offices, and was then named Secretary of the Constituent Congress of 1825, and, a little later, minister for the president Bernardino Rivadavia.
After the scandal of negotiations with the Brazilian Empire, Rivadavia resigned the presidency.  In his place, López was elected as caretaker, signing the dissolution of the Congress and calling elections in Buenos Aires.  The new governor, Manuel Dorrego took charge of the ministry; this unified the federalists.  When Dorrego fell from grace and was executed by firing squad by Juan Lavalle, Lopez was exiled to Uruguay.  He returned in 1830 as a member of the Tribunal of Justice for Juan Manuel de Rosas.  He was president of the Tribunal for many years and, among other things, presided over the judgement of the assassins of Juan Facundo Quiroga.
He was president of the literary salon led by Marcos Sastre, but was not part of the group known as the Generation of '37, to which belonged his two sons, Vicente Fidel López and Lucio Vicente López.

[[Liberal elite]]

CATEGORIES: Pejorative terms for people, Political terminology of the United States, Social class subcultures

Liberal elite is a political stigma used to describe politically left-leaning people, whose education had traditionally opened the doors to affluence. It is commonly used with the pejorative implication that the people who claim to support the rights of the working class are themselves members of the upper class, or upper middle class, and are therefore out of touch with the real needs of the people they claim to support and protect. The phrase "liberal elite" should not be confused with the term "elite" as used by writers such as Vilfredo Pareto and C. Wright Mills. They use the term to mean those who exercise the most political power.
The label is essentially a rhetorical device with flexible meaning depending on where in the English speaking world it is used. As a polemical term it has been used to refer to political positions as diverse as secularism, environmentalism, feminism, and other positions associated with the left.[tpl]cn|date=May 2014[/tpl]
The originating usage in the United States is applied with various changes to other English speaking countries and by extension to left-leaning elites in other countries. However, the term "liberal" does not have the same political connotation in all English speaking countries. In Australia it has the opposite connotation to that which it enjoys in the US. It is associated with the Liberal Party, a conservative and powerful party whose name is based on their objective to liberalise the market economy within Australia. In the UK, the Liberal Democratic Party occupies the political center between the rightist Conservative and the leftist Labour parties.[tpl]cn|date=May 2014[/tpl]

Selman Abraham Waksman (July 22, 1888 – August 16, 1973) was a Ukrainian-American inventor, biochemist and microbiologist whose research into organic substances—largely into organisms that live in soil—and their decomposition promoted the discovery of Streptomycin, and several other antibiotics.  A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University for four decades, he discovered over twenty antibiotics (a word which he coined) and introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others.  The proceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for microbiological research, which established the Waksman Institute of Microbiology located on Rutgers University's Busch Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey (USA). In 1952 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition "for his discovery of "streptomycin," the first antibiotic active against tuberculosis." Waksman was later accused of fraud by Albert Schatz, a PhD student working in his lab – who published the first paper on Streptomycin with Waksman as the secondary co-author.
In 2005 Selman Waksman was designated an ACS National Historical Chemical Landmark in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more than fifteen antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective treatment for tuberculosis.[tpl]cite web | title = Selman Waksman and Antibiotics | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/selmanwaksman.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 [/tpl]

It is the last major tributary entering the Yukon before the larger river empties into the Bering Sea.
Rising at the confluence of the North Fork Koyukuk River with the Middle Fork Koyukuk River, it flows generally southwest to meet the larger river at Koyukuk.[tpl]cite book|title=Alaska Atlas & Gazetteer|publisher=DeLorme|location=Yarmouth, Maine|pages=134, 136|edition=7th|year=2010|isbn=978-0-89933-289-5[/tpl] The river, with headwaters above the Arctic Circle in the Endicott Mountains of the Brooks Range, drains an area north of the Yukon River that includes part of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, as well as Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge.
The main stem of the river flows by the communities of Evansville, Bettles, Alatna, Allakaket, Hughes, and Huslia before reaching Koyukuk. Its headwaters tributaries include the Koyukuk's south, middle, and north forks, the Alatna River, and the John River.Benke and Cushing, pp. 789–90 Major tributaries further downstream include the Kanuti, Batzu, Hogatza, Huslia, Dulbi, Kateel, and Gisasa rivers.

[[Tropical garden]]

CATEGORIES: Types of garden, Tropical flora

A tropical garden features tropical plants and requires good rainfall or a decent irrigation or sprinkler system for watering. These gardens typically need fertilizer and heavy mulching.
Tropical gardens are no longer exclusive to tropical areas. Many gardeners in colder climates are adopting the tropical garden design, which is possible through careful choice of plants and flowers. Main features include plants with very large leaves, vegetation that builds in height towards the back of the garden, creating a dense garden. Large plants and small trees hang over the garden, leaving sunlight to hit the ground directly.

[[Apollo Command/Service Module]]

CATEGORIES: Manned spacecraft, Missions to the Moon, Apollo program hardware

The Command/Service Module (CSM) was one of two spacecraft, along with the Lunar Module, used for the United States Apollo program which landed astronauts on the Moon. It was built for NASA by North American Aviation. It was launched by itself into suborbital and low Earth orbit test missions with the Saturn IB launch vehicle, and three times by itself and nine times with the Lunar Module as part of the Apollo spacecraft assembly on the larger Saturn V launch vehicle, which was capable of sending it to the Moon.
After the Apollo lunar program, the CSM saw manned service as a crew shuttle for the Skylab program, and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in which an American crew rendezvoused and docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in Earth orbit.
The CSM consisted of two segments: the Command Module, a cabin which housed a crew of three and equipment needed for re-entry and splashdown; and a Service Module that provided propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission. The Service Module was cast off and allowed to burn up in the atmosphere before the Command Module re-entered and brought the crew home.
The CSM was initially designed to return all three astronauts from the lunar surface on a direct-descent mission which would not use a separate Lunar Module, and thus had no provisions for docking with another spacecraft. This, plus other required design changes led to the decision to design two versions of the CSM: Block I was to be used for unmanned missions and a single manned Earth orbit flight (Apollo 1), while the more advanced Block II was designed for use with the Lunar Module. But the Apollo 1 flight was cancelled by a cabin fire which killed the crew and destroyed the Command Module during a launch rehearsal test. Corrections of the problems which caused the fire were applied to the Block II spacecraft, which was used for all manned missions.

M-34 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the southeastern region of the US state of Michigan. It has a western terminus near Osseo on M-99 and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at Business US Highway 223 (BUS US 223) and M-52 in Adrian. The highway serves a number of smaller communities in the area and intersects two US Highways while carrying between 4,200 and 11,300 vehicles on a daily basis.
M-34 was designated and signed with the beginning of the state highway system around July 1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.

Minot International Airport 
 is in Ward County, North Dakota, two miles north of the city of Minot, which owns it. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport.
Delta Air Lines has five daily flights to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. Some are Delta Connection, but in 2013 Delta has mainline flights to Minneapolis-St. Paul, unusual for a city as small as Minot. Some flights are on larger two-class aircraft. Delta alone will be providing 528 seats per day to Minot; North Dakota's booming oil industry has spurred demand for larger aircraft.
United Airlines became Minot's second airline in June 2010, starting with two daily flights to Denver International Airport; it now has four. United also flies three times-weekly charters to Houston, Texas.
Allegiant became the airport's third airline, with twice-weekly direct flights to Las Vegas on October 22, 2010. Allegiant then added twice-weekly service to Phoenix-Mesa. The number of flights to both destinations fluctuates depending on demand, and can be has high as five flights per week. Passenger loads have stayed high.
Frontier Airlines, with an announcement on August 15, 2012, became the airport's fourth airline and started service November 5, 2012 with one flight four days per week to Denver. The original Frontier Airlines served Minot, on a route that connected it with Saskatoon, Regina and Denver, prior to that airline's bankruptcy and halting of operations in 1986.
Customs service is available for aircraft arriving from Canada and other countries. Minot International has no scheduled passenger airline service out of the country, but receives its international title (like many other airports) because of this customs service. The TSA fully searches all passengers and carry-on luggage prior to boarding, rather than using a selective process as is the case at major airports.
The airport offers pay parking and car rental services. Concessions are inside security and the "Hangar Grill" recently opened on the second floor.[tpl]cite web |url = http://whyflyminot.com/about/ | title = About the Airport | publisher = Minot International Airport[/tpl]

Leonard Eugene Alley (born July 10, 1940 in Richmond, Virginia) is a former Major League Baseball shortstop who played his entire career for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1963–73).
Alley was a modest hitter but an exceptionally steady shortstop with good range and an accurate throwing arm. He won two Gold Glove Awards at shortstop (1966–67) and also garnered two All-Star appearances primarily on the strength of his glove. He spent most of his career turning double plays with Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Bill Mazeroski, and the duo set a MLB record of 161 double plays in a season in 1966 that still stands (when the Pirates set a National League record with 215 total double plays).  They also joined a select list of eight shortstop-second baseman duos to each win a Gold Glove the same season while playing together twice (1967–68).  Shoulder and knee problems ultimately ended his career and prevented him from realizing his full potential.
On September 2, 1970, Alley hit an inside the park grand slam at Jarry Park in Montreal,against the Montreal Expos. With the bases loaded, facing Carl Morton, Alley hit a line drive which landed in front of center fielder Boots Day, who slipped on the wet grass. The ball rolled all the way to the wall in deepest center field, and all the baserunners and Alley scored.

He also is the first player to accumulate at least 500 doubles in his first 12 seasons.
Pujols was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States in 1996. After one season of college baseball, he was selected by the Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 MLB Draft. As a rookie for the Cardinals in 2001, he unanimously won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. He finished second in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting in 2002, and he won the batting title in 2003 after hitting .359.

He won his first NL MVP Award in 2005, and he won his first World Series in 2006 when the Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games.
Pujols failed to score 100 runs for the first time in his career in 2007. In 2008, he won his second NL MVP. He won the award again in 2009 while leading the league in home runs for the first time, and in 2010 he led the NL in home runs and RBIs.

Ellen Wheeler (born October 9, 1961 in Hollywood, California) is an American actress, director and producer. She has appeared in several soap operas, including Another World and All My Children. In 1986, she won the Daytime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series" for her work as twins Marley and Vicky Love Hudson on Another World. In 1988, she won another Daytime Emmy for "Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series" for her work as Cindy Parker Chandler on All My Children. Wheeler's character was one of the first characters with AIDS on daytime television. Wheeler also made a memorable guest appearance as Phyllis Wicke in the 1991 primetime revival of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows.
In 1996, she starred in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, "The Quickening".
In 1998, she briefly reprised the role of Marley on Another World. Rather than have the same actress play the role of both twins, the show made the unprecedented move to have Wheeler, the first actress to play the twins, portray Marley, and have actress Jensen Buchanan continue to play Vicky; their differences in appearance (other than a considerable height and build difference which were never addressed) were explained by plastic surgery after Marley was disfigured in a fire.
Wheeler was once married to her Another World costar, Tom Eplin. They were married during the time that their characters "Vicky/Marley" and "Jake" were involved.

[[Three-check chess]]

Three-check chess is a variation of chess, in which a player wins if he checks his opponent three times.  Anatoly Karpov is said to excel in this chess variant [tpl]harvcol|Pritchard|2007|p=83[/tpl]. 
This chess variant is much more tactical than standard chess, sacrifices are very common, there are a lot of traps in the opening.  Two checks is already a big advantage and may be worth more than one piece. The game rarely reaches endgame – usually it is decided before queens are traded.

The body of water called Lake Placid is in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York in the United States of America.   The lake is approximately [tpl]convert|2170|acre|km2[/tpl], and has an average depth of about [tpl]convert|50|ft|m[/tpl].  It is located in the towns of North Elba and St. Armand, both in Essex County.
The lake, which borders the northern part of the village of Lake Placid, New York, is a source of drinking water for the town, and maintaining water quality in the lake is a major local issue. The lake is fed by springs and mountain streams, and because most of the houses are unoccupied much of the year, the water remains clean. 
There are nearly 300 houses on the lake shore. 
Local efforts to combat aquatic invasive species have been successful, aided by a boat cleaning station where powerboats are put into the water.  
The lake has produced record lake trout.

Punakaiki is a small community on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, between Westport and Greymouth. The community lies on the edge of the Paparoa National Park.  
The Pancake Rocks are a very popular tourist goal at Dolomite Point south of the main village. The Pancake Rocks are a heavily eroded limestone area where the sea bursts through several vertical blowholes during high tides. Together with the 'pancake'-layering of the limestone (created by immense pressure on alternating hard and soft layers of marine creatures and plant sediments),Punakaiki Pancake Rocks & Blowholes (from the New Zealand Department of Conservation website) these form the main attraction of the area.
The Pancake Rocks are presently explorable by a number of walkways winding through the rock formations, parts of these wheelchair-accessible and others carved into stairways up and down the rock faces. State Highway 6, the only through road on the West Coast, passes through the town.

The Obelisco de Buenos Aires (Obelisk of Buenos Aires) is a national historic monument and icon of Buenos Aires. Located in the Plaza de la República, in the intersection of avenues Corrientes and 9 de Julio, it was built to commemorate the fourth centenary of the first foundation of the city.
In order to enrich the surroundings of the iconic monument, the government of the city started the project Punto Obelisco, creating a zone full of LED signs. Since the Obelisk of the city is always associated with the night and entertainment of Buenos Aires, this project creates a zone similar to Times Square in New York and Picadilly Circus in London.

[[Design for Six Sigma]]

CATEGORIES: Design, Quality, Six Sigma

Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is a separate and emerging business-process management methodology related to traditional Six Sigma.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] While the tools and order used in Six Sigma require a process to be in place and functioning, DFSS has the objective of determining the needs of customers and the business, and driving those needs into the product solution so created.  DFSS is relevant to the complex system/product synthesis phase, especially in the context of unprecedented system development. It is process generation in contrast with process improvement. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
There are different options for the implementation of DFSS. Unlike Six Sigma, which is commonly driven via DMAIC (Define - Measure - Analyze - Improve - Control) projects, DFSS has spawned a number of stepwise processes, all in the style of the DMAIC procedure. Another option is, however, to integrate the DFSS approach into the Product Development Process.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hasenkamp|first=Torben|coauthors=Annika Ölme|title=Introducing Design for Six Sigma at SKF|journal=Int.J.Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage|year=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=172-189|doi=10.1504/IJSSCA.2008.020281[/tpl] 
DMADV, define – measure – analyze – design – verify, is sometimes synonymously referred to as DFSS.  The traditional DMAIC Six Sigma process, as it is usually practiced, which is focused on evolutionary and continuous improvement manufacturing or service process development, usually occurs after initial system or product design and development have been largely completed.  DMAIC Six Sigma as practiced is usually consumed with solving existing manufacturing or service process problems and removal of the defects and variation associated with defects.  On the other hand, DFSS (or DMADV) strives to generate a new process where none existed, or where an existing process is deemed to be inadequate and in need of replacement.  DFSS aims to create a process with the end in mind of optimally building the efficiencies of Six Sigma methodology into the process before implementation; traditional Six Sigma seeks for continuous improvement after a process already exists.

[[Home Taping Is Killing Music]]

CATEGORIES: Political slogans, British music industry, Copyright campaigns

"Home Taping Is Killing Music" was the slogan of a 1980s anti-copyright infringement campaign by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), a British music industry trade group. With the rise in cassette recorder popularity, the BPI feared that people being able to record music from the radio onto cassettes would cause a decline in record sales. The logo, consisting of a Jolly Roger formed from the silhouette of a Compact Cassette, also included the words And It's Illegal.
The campaign has in recent years experienced a revival, as the Norwegian branch of IFPI launched a new campaign named Piracy Kills Music. The campaign has exactly the same message, same name and even very similar logos. The campaign won the Norwegian 2008 Gulltaggenhttp://www.gulltaggen.no/19266/2008 [tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] award for "Best Internet Strategy" with much controversy.
An early proponent of home taping was Malcolm McLaren, who was at the time managing the British band Bow Wow Wow. In 1980 the band released their Cassette single "C30, C60, C90 Go" on a cassette that featured a blank other side that on which the buyer could record their own music. The band's record label, EMI, dropped the group shortly afterwards because the single allegedly promoted home taping.

Nitsch's abstract splatter paintings, like his performance pieces, address the excessive beauty and intensification of human existence. In the 1950s, Nitsch conceived of the Orgien Mysterien Theater (which roughly translates as Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries or The Orgiastic Mystery Theater), staging nearly 100 performances between 1962 and 1998.HERMANN NITSCH, By Jonas Vogt, Alexander Nussbaumer.

Altichiero da Verona (c. 1330 – c. 1390), also called Aldighieri da Zevio, was an  Italian painter of the Gothic style. A follower of Giotto, Altichiero is credited with founding the Veronese school. He worked in Verona and Padua — works by him survive in the church of Sant'Anastasia in Verona and in the basilica of Sant'Antonio and the Oratorio di San Giorgio in Padua (where the credit for the work has been generally shared with Jacopo d'Avanzi, about whom little is known).
Altichiero was probably born somewhere near Zevio. He became an important member of the della Scala's household, and around 1364 painted a series of frescoes based upon Flavius Josephus's The Wars of the Jews at the della Scala palace of Sala del Podestà.
There are frescoes by him in the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. In conjunction with D'Avanzo Veronese, he frescoed the chapel of St. James for which he was paid 792 ducats. The first seven frescoes on the life of St. James the Elder were by Altichiero.

[[Paper marbling]]
CATEGORIES: Paper, Paper art, Arts and crafts

Paper marbling is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar to smooth marble or other stone. The patterns are the result of color floated on either plain water or a viscous solution known as size, and then carefully transferred to an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. Through several centuries, people have applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and stationery. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique monotype.

Marcel Dadi (20 August 1951 – 17 July 1996) was a Tunisian-born Jewish French guitarist known for his finger-picking style which faithfully recreated the instrumental styles of American guitarists such as Chet Atkins, Merle Travis and Jerry Reed. He became a personal friend of country star Chet Atkins.
Born in Sousse, Dadi released several LPs and some instructional videos before his early death. His recordings featured a mix of compositions by his American heroes and original compositions of his own in a similar style. A feature of his early LPs was that they included a tablature booklet, allowing guitarists to learn the tunes for themselves. Dadi often recorded tunes dedicated to his friends, such as "Roger Chesterfield," dedicated to Roger C. Field with whom he first went to Nashville in 1975 to visit Chet Atkins.
Dadi died when N93119, the Boeing 747 on TWA Flight 800, exploded off the coast of Long Island.EXPLOSION ABOARD T.W.A.

Vulcan is a pumice cone in Papua New Guinea. It is a sub-vent of the Rabaul caldera and lies on the western rim of the larger feature. Its most recent eruption was in 1994, when in conjunction with another vent, Tavurvur, the eruptions of Vulcan forced the temporary abandonment of the city of Rabaul and the relocation of the local administrative centres of East New Britain Province, to a new capital, Kokopo. Today, the slopes of Vulcan are now forested, as a result of dormancy since 1994.

[[Result set]]

CATEGORIES: Databases

An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. Depending on the database system, the number of rows in the result set may or may not be known. Usually, this number is not known up front because the result set is built on-the-fly.  Precomputations often impose undesired performance impacts.[tpl]Dubious|reason=At which time are these precomputations done? Usually, precomputations are done for the reason of reducing performance impacts at a later point in time|date=September 2012[/tpl]
A result set is effectively a table. The ORDER BY clause can be used in a query to impose a certain sort condition on the rows. Without that clause, there is no guarantee whatsoever on the order in which the rows are returned.

Buick Century is the model name used by the Buick division of General Motors for a line of upscale performance cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958, and from 1973 to 2005 for a mid-size car.
The model name Century came about when Buick was designing its first production automobile capable of reaching a speed of 100 mph. The division needed to come up with a name. One of the Buick executives had returned from a recent trip to the British isles and told the other executives that the British referred to going 100 mph as "doing the century". The executives liked the Century name and it stuck.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
The Century was sold as the Buick Regal in Japan, as Toyota owns the right to the name Century.

A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH, [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ʌ|b|ə|ˈ|r|æ|k|n|ɔɪ|d|_|ˈ|h|ɛ|m|ᵊ|r|ɪ|dʒ[/tpl]), or subarachnoid haemorrhage in British English, is bleeding into the subarachnoid space—the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. This may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or may result from head injury.
Symptoms of SAH include a severe headache with a rapid onset ("thunderclap headache"), vomiting, confusion or a lowered level of consciousness, and sometimes seizures. In general, the diagnosis is confirmed with a CT scan of the head, or occasionally by lumbar puncture.  Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Surgery for aneurysms was introduced in the 1930s, but since the 1990s many aneurysms are treated by a less invasive procedure called "coiling", which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels.
SAH is a form of stroke and comprises 1–7 percent of all strokes. It is a medical emergency and can lead to death or severe disability—even when recognized and treated at an early stage. Up to half of all cases of SAH are fatal and 10–15 percent of casualties die before reaching a hospital, and those who survive often have neurological or cognitive impairment.

Al-Ahram ([tpl]lang-ar|الأهرام[/tpl]; The Pyramids), founded on 5 August 1875, is the most widely circulating Egyptian daily newspaper, and the second oldest after al-Waqa'i`al-Masriya (The Egyptian Events, founded 1828).[tpl]cite web|title=Publication overview|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/egypt/documents/semc/20111122_en.pdf|work=Ipsos|accessdate=9 November 2013[/tpl] It is majority owned by the Egyptian government.
Given the large dialectal variety of the Arabic language, Al-Ahram is widely considered an influential source of writing style in Arabic. In 1950, the Middle East Institute described Al-Ahram as being to the Arabic-reading public within its area of distribution, "What The Times is to Englishmen and the New York Times to Americans",Middle East Institute, 1950, p. 155. however it has often been accused of heavy influence and censorship by the Egyptian government.
In addition to the main edition published in Egypt, the paper publishes two other Arabic-language editions, one geared to the Arab World and the other aimed at an international audience, as well as editions in English and French.

[[Trainmaster Command Control]]

CATEGORIES: Digital model train control

Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains. It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives.http://www.digitdynam.com/command_control.html
TMCC permits operation of multiple trains on the same track without complex wiring, and also gives locomotives realistic digitized sounds.
Its development was backed financially by rock and roller Neil Young as part of a partnership between Young and one-time Lionel owner Richard Kughn known as Liontech. Liontech, roughly headquartered on Young's northern California ranch, consisted of a loose confederation of technology developers whom Young had assembled to help develop individual components of the TrainMaster Command system. 
Chief among these contributors was Applied Design Laboratories of Grass Valley, California, headed by Atari 2600 co-patent holder Ron Milner. Young had been referred to Milner by his neighbor and friend, Nolan Bushnell, co-founder of Atari. Milner's team (consisting of numerous members, including Robert Johnson and Bryan Scott) developed the main elements of the Command system, including the innovation of using the Lionel steel tubular track system as a broadcast antenna for digital signals overlaying the electrical power being delivered through the track to locomotives, rolling stock and connected accessories.
Also included in the TrainMaster Command system is RailSounds, which provides digital sound effects to complement the digital control features of the system. RailSounds was developed by a separate team of technologists in the Bay Area. An early, distinguishing feature of RailSounds was the fact that each individual locomotive system (e.g. a "Hudson" 4-6-4 steam locomotive) was based on a real-life counterpart, not a generic "steam" sound. The Lionel RailSounds Hudson sound system, interestingly, was captured by the Liontech team on location in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, using the former Canadian Pacific "Royal Hudson" as the sound model.
Lionel has since licensed TMCC to some of its competitors, including K-Line, and aftermarket circuit boards are available to add TMCC to O scale and S scale trains that lack the capability.
Neil Young's involvement in Liontech was the direct reason for his becoming aware of Kughn's putting Lionel Trains, Inc. up for sale in early 1995. Young saw an opportunity to become at least part owner in the company he revered, and working with Liontech team member Jim Bunte, assembled a marketing plan to attract investors to help underwrite the purchase price. After several meetings with potential lead equity partners, a deal was struck with Martin Davis, former chairman of Paramount / Gulf+Western, who had recently divested his ownership in that company to Sumner Redstone of Viacom. With his proceeds, Davis founded Wellspring Associates, a New York-based investment firm. The acquisition of Lionel Trains, Inc. and its September 1995 transformation into Lionel LLC was Wellspring's first investment.
The competitor MTH uses a similar system, called DCS.

[[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939]]
CATEGORIES: Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1939 in baseball

The 1939 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were the last ones conducted prior to the Hall's opening that year. Needing just one addition to complete the initial goal of 10 inductees from the 20th century, members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting active players. Difficulties in convening the Centennial Commission of the previous two years led to an even smaller Old-Timers Committee selecting inductees from the 19th century - a cause of particular urgency to many who had been anticipating the five promised but unfulfilled selections in that area for over three years.
In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in Cooperstown, New York on June 12 of that year. After the Hall's opening, a special election was also held in December. Because the initial goal for the Hall's opening of selecting 10 players from the 20th century had now been met, it was further decided to delay the next election until 1942, even though observers widely believed that electing three players per year (12 had been elected in four regular BBWAA elections) had turned out to be an ideal rate.

[[Oteai]]

CATEGORIES: Go (game), Go competitions

The [tpl]nihongo|Oteai|大手合|Ōteai[/tpl] was a tournament used in Japan, by the Nihon Ki-in and Kansai Ki-in, to determine the ranking of its go professionals on the dan scale. It was instituted in the 1920s soon after the Ki-in was set up in 1924. Initially it was run in Spring and Autumn sessions in Tokyo, with the pros brought together to play around eight games in each session (the name means simply "grand meeting"). It has currently ceased to exist after it was replaced by new reforms. 
Professionals in the Nihon Ki-in could claim promotions based on their performance in the Oteai.  To qualify for a promotion, players had to win a certain percentage of a certain number of successive games.  The proportion, and number of games depended on the player's current rank, with qualification obviously becoming more stringent as one progressed.
