The River Axe is a river in Dorset, Somerset and Devon, in the south-west of England. 
It rises near Beaminster in Dorset, flows west then south by Axminster and joins the English Channel at Axmouth near Seaton in Lyme Bay. During its [tpl]convert|22|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] course it is fed by various streams and by the tributary rivers Yarty and Coly.
It is a shallow, non-navigable river, although its mouth at Axmouth has some boating activity.[tpl]cite web|title=Parish Biodiversity Audit for Axmouth|url=http://www.axmouthparishcouncil.co.uk/uploads/Axmouth%20PBA_draft_apr2010.pdf|publisher=Devon County Council|accessdate=14 December 2013[/tpl]
In 1999, a section of the river extending for [tpl]convert|13|km|mi[/tpl]—from  the confluence with the Blackwater River (ST325023) to Colyford Bridge ([tpl]gbmappingsmall|SY259927[/tpl])—was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It was described as supporting "an exceptionally diverse aquatic and marginal flora". The river's diversity comes from its active geomorphology, which has created a number of natural features that support niche ecologies; it also comes from there being a limited number of trees on the river bank, allowing in light; and also the riverbed stability in the lower reaches of the river. A majority of the SSSI runs through Devon; only 150 metres runs through Dorset. The underlying geology of the riverbed is alluvium with areas of valley gravel, clay, shale and marl. The fish life in the river is considered of European interest; aquatic life more generally includes salmon, bullheads, otters, medicinal leeches and kingfishers; all are of particular value, as is the diverse aquatic and marginal plant life. The geomorphology of the meanders south of Axminster are the particular geological interest.[tpl]cite web | title=River Axe SSSI citation| url=[tpl]sssi link|2000139[/tpl] [/tpl]

[[Brisance]]

CATEGORIES: Explosives

Brisance is the shattering capability of a high explosive, determined mainly by its detonation pressure.  The term can be traced from the French verb "briser" (to break or shatter) ultimately derived from the Celtic word "brissim" (to break).[tpl]cite web|title=Brisance|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Brisance|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=31 March 2014[/tpl] Brisance is of practical importance for determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, grenades, structures, and the like.
Fragmentation occurs by the action of the transmitted shock wave, the strength of which depends on the detonation pressure of the explosive. Generally, the higher this pressure, the finer the fragments generated. High detonation pressure correlates with high detonation velocity, the speed at which the detonation wave propagates through the explosive, but not necessarily with the explosive's total energy (or work capacity), some of which may be released after passage of the detonation wave. A more brisant explosive, therefore, projects smaller fragments but not necessarily at a higher velocity than a less brisant one.
The sand crush test is commonly used to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT (which is considered a standard reference for many purposes). No single test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties of two or more compounds;[tpl]Fact|date=November 2007[/tpl] it is important to examine the data from several such tests[tpl]Fact|date=November 2007[/tpl] (sand crush, trauzl lead block test, and so forth) in order to gauge relative brisance. True values for comparison require field experiments.[tpl]Fact|date=November 2007[/tpl]
One of the most brisant of the conventional explosives is cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (also known as RDX or Hexogen).[tpl]cite book|title=TM 9-1300-214|publisher=US Army[/tpl]http://www.freepyroinfo.com/Pyrotechnic/Pyrotechnic_Books/Tm_9_1300_214_U_S_Military_Explosives.pdf[tpl]dl|date=October 2013[/tpl]

O'Connor achieved worldwide success in 1990 with a new arrangement of Prince's song "Nothing Compares 2 U".
Since then, while maintaining her singing career, she has occasionally encountered controversy, partly due to her statements and gestures—such as her ordination as a priest despite being a woman with a Roman Catholic background—and her strongly expressed views on organised religion, women's rights, war, and child abuse.
In addition to her nine solo albums her work includes many singles, songs for films, collaborations with many other artists and appearances at charity fundraising concerts.

[[River Ant]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Norfolk

The River Ant is a tributary river of the River Bure in the county of Norfolk, England.Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads. ISBN 0-319-23769-9. It is 17 miles long (of which 8.75 miles are now navigable), and has an overall drop of 25 metres from source to mouth. It is said that the Ant was formerly known as the River Smale and that this is the origin of the name of the village of Smallburgh.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northnorfolk.org/smallburgh/default_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Smallburgh Parish[/tpl]
The river's source is just east of the village of Antingham in North Norfolk at Antingham Ponds. Just below the pools the river's route has been used as a canal in the past, starting at what was Antingham bone mill. An Act of Parliament established the North Walsham & Dilham Canal in 1812, as a wide gauge canal able to take a Norfolk wherry. It was built at a cost of £30,000 and opened on July 25, 1826, making the river navigable as far as Dilham, where the river widens and deepens. It carried manure, offal, flour, coal, and farm produce. In 1885, the canal was sold for £600, but the canal company's solicitor disappeared with the money. The flood of 1912 washed away several staithes. The wherry "Ella" made the final trading journey on the canal from Bacton staithe in 1934. The canal was never nationalised and still belongs to the North Walsham Canal Company. The river, now in its canal form, curves around the north east of the town of North Walsham passing Bacton Wood Mill. Below Bacton Mill the canal reaches a lock at Ebridge mill. The lock is in poor condition but it is hoped that this section of canal will one day be restored and made navigable again. Further on at Briggate Bridge there is another mill and another disused lock.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (IT PGRFA),ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0510e/i0510e.pdf popularly known as the International Seed Treaty, is a comprehensive international agreement in harmony with the Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims at guaranteeing food security through the conservation, exchange and sustainable use of the world's plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA), as well as the fair and equitable benefit sharing arising from its use. It also recognises Farmers' Rights: to freely access genetic resources, unrestricted by intellectual property rights; to be involved in relevant policy discussions and decision making; and to use, save, sell and exchange seeds, subject to national laws.
However, as Regine Anderson of the farmers' rights project,http://www.farmersrights.org/ among others, including Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food,http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/officialreports/20091021_report-ga64_seed-policies-and-the-right-to-food_en.pdf argue, the interpretation and realisation of farmers' rights is weak and is not the same across all countries. Without a consistent, strong international focus on the realising the rights of farmers who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA to save, use, exchange and sell seeds saved on-farm, genetic variety of crops and related agricultural biodiversity will suffer.http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml India, for example, includes an interpretation of farmers' rights in its Plant Variety Protection and Farmers' Rights Act, allowing farmers a restricted right to save and sell seed they have produced on-farm as they always have, even if it contains genes from a protected variety.,http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtmlhttp://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf
The treaty has implemented a Multilateral System (MLS) of access and benefit sharing, among those countries that ratify the treaty, for a list of 64 of some of the most important food and forage crops essential for food security and interdependence. The genera and species are listed in Annex 1 to the treaty.
The treaty was negotiated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) and since 2006 has its own Governing Body under the aegis of the FAO.  The Governing Body is the highest organ of the Treaty as established in Article 19. Composed of representatives of all Contracting Parties, its basic function is to promote the full implementation of the Treaty, including the provision of policy guidance on the implementation of the Treaty. The Governing Body elects its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, in conformity with its Rules of Procedure. They are collectively referred to as "the Bureau".
Some believe the treaty could be an example of responsible global governance for ensuring that plant genetic resources essential for present and future food security can be kept accessible to all farmers and in the public domain. Chapter 7 of the Second Report on the State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (SoWPGR-2)http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1500e/i1500e.pdf entitled "Access to Plant Genetic Resources, the sharing of benefits arising out of their utilization and the realization of Farmers’ Rights" is mainly dedicated to the International Treaty.

One such confrontation was the Homestead Strike of 1892, in which Pinkerton agents were called in to reinforce the strikebreaking measures of industrialist Henry Clay Frick, acting on behalf of Andrew Carnegie.

Originally best known for his Mr. Moto spy stories, he achieved popular success and critical respect for his satirical novels, winning a Pulitzer Prize for The Late George Apley in 1938. One of his abiding themes was the confining nature of life in America's upper class and among those who aspired to join it. Marquand treated those whose lives were bound by these unwritten codes with a characteristic mix of respect and satire.

Charlie Chan is a fictional U.S. Chinese detective created by Earl Derr Biggers. Loosely basing Chan on Honolulu detective Chang Apana, Biggers conceived of the benevolent and heroic Chan as an alternative to Yellow Peril stereotypes and villains like Fu Manchu. Chan is a detective for the Honolulu police, though many stories feature Chan traveling the world as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes.
Chan first appeared in Biggers' novels, then was featured in a number of media. Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character was first portrayed by East Asian actors, and the films met with little success. In 1931, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland as Chan in Charlie Chan Carries On; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce fifteen more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland's death, U.S. actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan; Toler made twenty-two Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler's death, six films were made, starring Roland Winters.
Interpretations of Chan by twenty-first century critics are split, especially regarding his ethnicity. Positive assessors of Chan argue that he is portrayed as intelligent, heroic, benevolent and honorable — in contrast to the adverse depictions of evil or conniving Chinese people then current in print and on screen. Others state that Chan, despite his good qualities, reinforces certain East Asian stereotypes, such as an alleged incapacity to speak fluent English and the possession of an overly tradition-bound and subservient nature. The Chan films of the 1930s and 1940s were shown successfully in China, where the character was popular and respected and not in the least seen as sinophobic. 
More recent film adaptations in the 1990s have been poorly received. The character has been featured in several radio programs, two television shows, and comics.

[[Toponymy of England]]

CATEGORIES: English toponymy

Place-names in England derive from various linguistic origins. Modern interpretations are apt to be inexact: many English forms[tpl]Clarify|date=April 2011[/tpl] and names have been corrupted and broken down over the years, due to changes in language and culture which have caused the original meaning to be lost. In some cases, words used in place names are derived from languages that are extinct, and of which there are no extant known definitions; or place names may be compounds between two languages from different periods. Many names predate the radical changes in the English language triggered by the Norman Conquest, and some predate the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons.
Place names typically have meanings which were significant to the settlers of a locality (not necessarily the first settlers). Sometimes these meanings are relatively clear (for instance Newcastle, Three Oaks); but, more often, elucidating them requires study of ancient languages. In general, place names in England contain three broad elements: personal names (or pre-existing names of natural features), natural features, and settlement functions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] However, these elements derive from ancient languages spoken in the British Isles,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] and the combinations in a single name may not all date from the same period, or the same language. Much of the inferred development of British place names relies on the breaking down and corruption of place names. As the names lose their original meaning (because a new or modified language becomes spoken), the names are either changed, or drift to new forms, or are added to. An example is Breedon on the Hill in Leicestershire, whose name seems to have grown by the accretion of elements stressing the hill in the language currently spoken.'Bre' is Welsh, 'dun' English for hill "It looks as though the local British people spoke of "the hill" and the English, not realising 'bre' was a common noun, took it for the name of the hill.  A later failure to understand the meaning of the Old English 'dun' has caused the .. .. name to become Breedon on the Hill" [tpl]cite book|last=Gelling|first=Margaret|title=Signposts to the Past: Placenames and the history of England|year=1978|publisher=J M Dent & Sons|location=London|isbn=0 460 04264 5|page=92[/tpl]

The Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA) (also referred to by proponents as the Marriage Protection Amendment) is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution which would limit marriage in the United States to unions of one man and one woman. The FMA would also prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to same-sex or other unmarried heterosexual couples. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the support of two thirds of each house of Congress and ratification by three fourths of the states. The last Congressional vote on the proposed Amendment occurred in the United States House of Representatives on July 18, 2006, when the Amendment failed 236 to 187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The Senate has only voted on cloture motions with regard to the proposed Amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the Amendment and the 67 votes required to send the amendment to the states.

[[Visual thinking]]

CATEGORIES: Visual thinking, Developmental dyslexia

Visual thinking, also called visual/spatial learning, picture thinking, or right brained learning, is the phenomenon of thinking through visual processing.[tpl]sfn|Deza|2009|p=526[/tpl] 
Visual thinking has been described as seeing words as a series of pictures.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] It is common in approximately 60%–65% of the general population.[tpl]sfn|Deza|2009|p=526[/tpl]
"Real picture thinkers", those persons who use visual thinking almost to the exclusion of other kinds of thinking, make up a smaller percentage of the population. Research by child development theorist Linda Kreger Silverman suggests that less than 30% of the population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking, another 45% uses both visual/spatial thinking and thinking in the form of words, and 25% thinks exclusively in words. According to Kreger Silverman, of the 30% of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be 'true' "picture thinkers".[tpl]sfn|Silverman|2005[/tpl]

Boron is classified as a metalloid while the rest, with the possible exception of ununtrium, are considered other metals. Ununtrium has not yet been confirmed to be an other metal and, due to relativistic effects, might not turn out to be one. Boron occurs sparsely, probably because bombardment by the subatomic particles produced from natural radioactivity disrupts its nuclei. Aluminium occurs widely on earth, and indeed is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (8.3%).[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=1960 |title=Soviet Aluminium from Clay |journal=The New Scientist |volume=8 |issue=191 |page=89 |publisher=One Shilling Weekly |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vPmlBbHCOTIC&pg=PA89[/tpl] Gallium is found in the earth with an abundance of 13 ppm. Indium is the 61st most abundant element in the earth's crust, and thallium is found in moderate amounts throughout the planet. Ununtrium is never found in nature and therefore is termed a synthetic element.
Several group 13 elements have biological roles in the ecosystem. Boron is a trace element in humans and is essential for some plants. Lack of boron can lead to stunted plant growth, while an excess can also cause harm by inhibiting growth. Aluminium has neither a biological role nor significant toxicity and is considered safe. Indium and gallium can stimulate metabolism; gallium is credited with the ability to bind itself to iron proteins. Thallium is highly toxic, interfering with the function of numerous vital enzymes, and has seen use as a pesticide.[tpl]cite book |title=Clinical neurotoxicology: syndromes, substances, environments |last=Dobbs |first=Michael |year=2009 |publisher=Saunders |pages=276–278 |location=Philadelphia, Pa |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Pmcy24y2HyMC&pg=PA277|isbn=978-0-323-05260-3[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Wave mechanics, Waves, Articles containing video clips

Longitudinal waves, also known as "l-waves", are waves  in which the displacement of the medium is in the same direction as, or the opposite direction to, the direction of travel of the wave. Mechanical longitudinal waves are also called compressional waves or compression waves, because they produce compression and rarefaction when traveling through a medium.  The other main type of wave is the transverse wave, in which the displacements of the medium are at right angles to the direction of propagation.  Transverse mechanical waves are also called "t-waves" or "shear waves".

Robert Baldwin (May 12, 1804 – December 9, 1858) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who, with his political partner Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, led the first responsible ministry in Canada. "Responsible Government" marked the country's democratic independence, without a revolution, although not without violence. This achievement also included the introduction of municipal government, the introduction of a modern legal system and the Canadian Jury system, and the abolishing of imprisonment for debt. Baldwin is also noted for resisting a decades-long tradition of Orange Order terrorism of political reform in the colony, that went so far as to burn the Parliament buildings in Montreal in 1849.Saul, John Ralston.

[[Flag of Japan]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Japan, Flags of Asia, National symbols of Japan, Empire of Japan, Postwar Japan, Red and white flags

The national flag of Japan is a white rectangular flag with a large red disc (representing the sun) in the center. This flag is officially called [tpl]nihongo|Nisshōki|日章旗||"sun-mark flag"[/tpl] in Japanese, but is more commonly known as [tpl]nihongo|Hinomaru|日の丸||"circle of the sun"[/tpl].
The Nisshōki flag is designated as the national flag in the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem, which was promulgated and became effective on August 13, 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a national flag, the sun-disc flag had already become the de facto national flag of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the Daijō-kan, the governmental body of the early Meiji Era, each had a provision for a design of the national flag. A sun-disc flag was adopted as the national flag for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on February 27, 1870), and as the national flag used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on October 27, 1870). Use of the Hinomaru was severely restricted during the early years of the American occupation after World War II; these restrictions were later relaxed.
In early Japanese history, the Hinomaru motif was used on flags of daimyos and samurai. The ancient history Shoku Nihongi says that Emperor Mommu used a flag representing the sun in his court in 701, and this is the first recorded use of a sun-motif flag in Japan. The oldest existing flag is preserved in Unpō-ji temple, Kōshū, Yamanashi, which is older than the 16th century, and an ancient legend says that the flag was given to the temple by Emperor Go-Reizei in the 11th century.[tpl]vcite web | title=日の丸の御旗 | url=http://www.yamanashi-kankou.jp/kankou/spot/p1_4496.html | publisher=Yamanashi Tourism Organization | accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl][tpl]ja icon[/tpl][tpl]vcite web | title=宝物殿の案内 | url=http://unpoji.ko-shu.jp/treasure.html | publisher=Unpoji | accessdate=2011-07-17[/tpl][tpl]ja icon[/tpl][tpl]vcite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8x322-89x3MC&pg=PA54#|title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact: The Turning Points in Our History We Should Know More About |first= Alan |last=Axelrod |publisher =Fair Winds|year= 2009 |isbn=1-59233-375-3|page=54[/tpl]  During the Meiji Restoration, both the sun disc and the Rising Sun Ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy became major symbols in the emerging Japanese empire. Propaganda posters, textbooks, and films depicted the flag as a source of pride and patriotism. In Japanese homes, citizens were required to display the flag during national holidays, celebrations and other occasions as decreed by the government. Different tokens of devotion to Japan and its emperor featuring the Hinomaru motif became popular during the Second Sino-Japanese War and other conflicts. These tokens ranged from slogans written on the flag to clothing items and dishes that resembled the flag.
Public perception of the national flag varies. To some Japanese, the flag represents Japan, and no other flag could take its place.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] However, the flag is not frequently displayed in Japan due to its association with ultranationalism. The use of the flag and the national anthem Kimigayo have been a contentious issue for Japan's public schools since the end of World War II (the Pacific War). Disputes about their use have led to protests and lawsuits. To Okinawans, the flag represents the events of World War II and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. For some nations that had been occupied by Japan, the flag is a symbol of aggression and imperialism. The Hinomaru was used as a tool against occupied nations for purposes of intimidation, asserting Japan's dominance, or subjugation. Despite the negative connotations, Western and Japanese sources claim the flag is a powerful and enduring symbol to the Japanese. Several military banners of Japan are based on the Hinomaru, including the sunrayed Naval Ensign. The Hinomaru also serves as a template for other Japanese flags in public and private use.

Peter Bales (1547–1610?), English calligrapher, one of the inventors of shorthand writing, was born in London in 1547, and is described by Anthony Wood as a "most dexterous person in his profession, to the great wonder of scholars and others". We are also informed that "he spent several years in sciences among Oxonians, particularly, as it seems, in Gloucester Hall; but that study, which he used for a diversion only, proved at length an employment of profit".
He is mentioned for his skill in micrography in Holinshed's Chronicle:
Bales was likewise very dexterous in imitating handwritings, and between 1576 and 1590 was employed by Secretary Walsingham in certain political manoeuvres. We find him at the head of a school near the Old Bailey, London, in 1590, in which year he published his Writing Schoolemaster, in three Parts. This book included an Arte of Brachygraphie, which is one of the earliest attempts to construct a system of shorthand. In 1595 he had a great trial of skill with one Daniel Johnson, for a golden pen valued at £20, and won it; and a contemporary author further relates that he had also the arms of calligraphy given him, which are azure, a pen or. Bales died about the year 1610.

The  term Augustinians, named after Saint Augustine of Hippo (354–430), applies to two separate and unrelated types of Catholic religious orders:
(1) Several mendicant Orders of friars, who lived a mixed religious life of contemplation and apostolic ministry and follow the Rule of St. Augustine, a brief document providing guidelines for living in a religious community.  The largest and most familiar, originally known as the Hermits of Saint Augustine (O.E.S.A. - Ordo Eremitarum sancti Augustini) and also as the Austin friars, is now simply referred to as the Order of Saint Augustine (O.S.A.).
Two other Orders, the Augustinian Recollects and the Discalced Augustinians, were once part of the Augustinian Order under a single Prior General. The Recollect friars, founded in 1588 as a reform movement of the Augustinian friars in Spain, became autonomous in 1612 with their first Prior General, Enrique de la Sagrada. The Discalced friars became an independent religious congregation with their own Prior General in 1592, and were raised to the status of a separate mendicant Order in 1610.http://oadnet.webs.com/storia.htm
(2) Various congregations of clerics, known as canons regular, who also follow the Rule of St. Augustine, and embrace the evangelical counsels and lead a semi-monastic life, while remaining committed to pastoral care, appropriate to their primary vocation as priests. They generally form one large community, which might serve parishes in the vicinity, and are organized into autonomous religious congregations, which normally are distinct by region.
There are also Augustinian orders within the Anglican Communion.

[[Football League Cup]]

CATEGORIES: The Football League, Football League Cup, Football cup competitions in England, 1960 establishments in England

The Football League Cup, commonly known as the League Cup or by a name referring to the current sponsor, is an English men's association football competition. Like the FA Cup, it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis. Unlike the FA Cup, where 758 teams entered in 2012–13, only 92 clubs can enter the League Cup – the 20 Premier League clubs, and the 72 clubs of The Football League, which organises the competition. Also unlike the FA Cup, the semi-finals are played over two legs. The winners qualify for the UEFA Europa League, unless they have qualified for the Champions League through their league position, in which case the Europa League berth goes to the highest-placed team from the Premier League not already qualified for Europe. The current champions are Manchester City, who beat Sunderland 3–1 in the 2014 final to win their third League Cup.
Although the League Cup is one of the three major domestic trophies attainable by English league teams, it is perceived by larger clubs as a lower priority than the league championship, UEFA Champions League, and the FA Cup. League Cup winners receive £100,000 prize money (awarded by the Football League) with the runners-up receiving £50,000, considered relatively insignificant to top flight teams, compared to the £2 million prize money of the FA Cup, which is in turn eclipsed by the Premier League's television money (awarded on final league position) and consequent participation in the Champions League.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Faqs/0,,12306,00.html |title=Frequently asked questions about the F.A.

[[Tamar Bridge]]

CATEGORIES: Bridges completed in 1961, Bridges in Devon, Buildings and structures in Plymouth, Devon, Bridges in Cornwall, Suspension bridges in the United Kingdom, Toll bridges in England, Transport in Plymouth

The Tamar Bridge is a major road bridge at Saltash in southwest England carrying traffic between Cornwall and Devon over the River Tamar. When it opened in 1961 it was the longest suspension bridge in the United Kingdom.  In 2001 it became the world's first suspension bridge to be widened (from three to five lanes) using cantilevers.  The five lanes are divided as follows: three lanes carry the A38 trunk road, the fourth is reserved for eastbound local traffic and the fifth for pedestrians and cyclists.  Previously all traffic merged and shared the three lanes.
Construction of the Tamar Bridge began in July 1959.  Before this, the lowest road crossing of the River Tamar was Gunnislake New Bridge at the village of Gunnislake.  This seven-arched granite bridge was built in the early 16th century (c. 1520).  It is still in use today but it is only wide enough to carry one lane of traffic.  Before the Tamar Bridge was opened, most car drivers wishing to travel between Saltash (on the Cornish side) and the Devon city of Plymouth used car ferries.  Today the Tamar Bridge carries approximately 40,000 vehicles every day.  It is co-owned by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall Council, and is managed by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee.  A toll of £1.50 per car is charged when driving from Cornwall into Devon, although the price is halved using the electronic payment system. Motorcycles do not have to pay.
The Tamar Bridge is located above the Hamoaze, and runs parallel to Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Brunel Bridge) which opened in 1859 and is considered to be one of his greatest railway achievements.  Both bridges offer wonderful views of the Tamar Valley and Tamar Estuary.  The Tamar, Lynher and Tavy Valleys form one of England's thirty-seven Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The Haddiscoe Cut or New Cut is a canal in the English county of Norfolk and in The Broads National Park. The cut was conceived as a way to provide a more direct route from Lowestoft to Norwich, and was built as part of a larger scheme which included the linking of the River Waveney to Oulton Broad and Lake Lothing. It was opened in 1833, but the new route was not a financial success, and it was sold to a railway developer in 1842. It remained in railway ownership until Nationalisation in 1948, and was damaged by floods in 1953. An attempt to close it in 1954 was resisted by local interests, resulting in it being repaired. It is now managed by the Environment Agency.

CATEGORIES: Breckland, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk Broads, Rivers of Norfolk

The River Yare is a river in the English county of Norfolk. In its lower reaches it is one of the principal navigable waterways of The Broads and connects with the rest of the network.
The river rises south of Dereham close to the village of Shipdham. From there it flows in a generally eastward direction passing Barnham Broom and is joined by the River Tiffey before reaching Bawburgh. It then skirts the southern fringes of the city of Norwich, passing through Colney, Cringleford, Lakenham and Trowse. At Whitlingham it is joined by the  River Wensum and although the Wensum is the larger and longer of the two, the river downstream of their confluence continues to be called the Yare. Flowing eastward into The Broads it passes the villages of Bramerton, Surlingham, Rockland St. Mary and Cantley. Just before Reedham at Hardley Cross (erected in 1676Norwich Boundary Crosses) it is joined by the River Chet. The cross marks the ancient boundary between the City of Norwich and Borough of Great Yarmouth. Beyond Reedham the river passes the famously isolated marshland settlement of Berney Arms before entering the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers Waveney and Bure and finally enters the North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map OL40 - The Broads. ISBN 0-319-23769-9.Ordnance Survey (1999). OS Explorer Map 237 - Norwich. ISBN 0-319-21868-6.
The Yare is the frequent subject of landscape paintings by members of the early 19th century Norwich School of artists. The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. contains an oil painting by John Crome entitled Moonlight on the Yare. Joseph Stannard depicted the river in Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon (1824) and Boats on the Yare near Bramerton (1828) which is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.
The river is navigable to small coastal vessels from Norwich to the sea, and in former times carried significant commercial traffic to that city. At Reedham the river is joined by the Haddiscoe Cut, a canal which provides a direct navigable link to the River Waveney at Haddiscoe avoiding Breydon Water.

[[Adage]]

CATEGORIES: Adages

An adage ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|ɨ|dʒ[/tpl]; Latin: adagium) is a short, usually philosophical, but memorable saying which holds some important fact of experience that is considered true by many people, or that has gained some credibility through its long memetic use.
It often involves a planning failure such as "don't count your chickens before they hatch" or "don't burn your bridges." Adages may be interesting observations, practical or ethical guidelines, or skeptical comments on life.
Some adages are products of folk wisdom that attempt to summarize some form of basic truth; these are generally known as proverbs or bywords. An adage that describes a general rule of conduct is a "maxim". A pithy expression that has not necessarily gained credit through long use, but is distinguished by particular depth or good style is an aphorism, while one distinguished by wit or irony is an epigram.
Through overuse, an adage may become a cliché or truism, or be described as an "old saw." Adages coined in modernity are often given proper names and called "laws" in imitation of physical laws, or "principles". Some adages, such as Murphy's Law, are first formulated informally and given proper names later, while others, such as the Peter Principle, have proper names in their initial formulation; it might be argued that the latter sort does not represent "true" adages, but the two types are often difficult to distinguish.
Adages were collected and used by ancient writers and their work and writings inspired the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus to produce a massive collection of Adagia in the early sixteenth century. There have been many such collections since, usually in vernacular languages.
Adages formulated in popular works of fiction often find their way into popular culture, especially when there exists a subculture devoted to the work or its genre, as is the case with science fiction novels. Many professions and subcultures create their own adages, which may be seen as a sort of jargon; such adages may find their way into popular usage, sometimes becoming altered in the process. Online communities, such as those that develop in internet forums or Usenet newsgroups, are known for generating their own adages.[tpl]cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|year= 1994|isbn=0-87779-132-5[/tpl]

Theodore (602 – 19 September 690; sometimes known as Theodore of Tarsus or Theodore of Canterbury[tpl]harvnb|Farmer|2004|pp=496–497[/tpl].) was the eighth Archbishop of Canterbury, best known for his reform of the English Church and establishment of a school in Canterbury.
Theodore's life can be divided into the time before his arrival in Britain as Archbishop of Canterbury, and his archiepiscopate. Until recently, scholarship on Theodore had focused on only the latter period since it is attested in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English, and also in Stephen of Ripon's Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, whereas no source directly mentions Theodore's earlier activities. However, Michael Lapidge and Bernard Bischoff have reconstructed his earlier life based on a study of texts produced by his Canterbury School.

Sintering is to form a solid mass of material by heat"Sinter, v." Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 and/or pressure"Sinter" The Free Dictionary accessed May 1, 2014 without melting it.
Sintering happens naturally in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process used with metals, ceramics, plastics, and other materials. The atoms in the materials diffuse across the boundaries of the particles, fusing the particles together and creating one solid piece. Because the sintering temperature does not have to reach the melting point of the material, sintering is often chosen as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points such as tungsten and molybdenum. The study of sintering in metallurgy powder-related processes is known as powder metallurgy. A simple, intuitive example of sintering can be observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other.
The word "sinter" comes from the Middle High German Sinter, a cognate of English "cinder".

[[Spray drying]]

CATEGORIES: Food industry, Flavor technology, Unit operations, Industrial processes, Pharmaceutical industry

Spray drying is a method of producing a dry powder from a liquid or slurry by rapidly drying with a hot gas. This is the preferred method of drying of many thermally-sensitive materials such as foods and pharmaceuticals. A consistent particle size distribution is a reason for spray drying some industrial products such as catalysts. Air is the heated drying medium; however, if the liquid is a flammable solvent such as ethanol or the product is oxygen-sensitive then nitrogen is used.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uKOGg1vk61MC&pg=PA710|page=710|title=Handbook of industrial drying|author=A. S. Mujumdar|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=1-57444-668-1[/tpl]
All spray dryers use some type of atomizer or spray nozzle to disperse the liquid or slurry into a controlled drop size spray. The most common of these are rotary disks and single-fluid high pressure swirl nozzles. Alternatively, for some applications two-fluid or ultrasonic nozzles are used. Depending on the process needs, drop sizes from 10 to 500 µm can be achieved with the appropriate choices. The most common applications are in the 100 to 200 µm diameter range. The dry powder is often free-flowing.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=GkpNO5RnxNgC&pg=PA588|page=588|title=Combustion and incineration processes|author=Walter R. Niessen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8247-0629-3[/tpl]
The most common spray dryers are called single effect as there is only one drying air on the top of the drying chamber (see n°4 on the scheme). In most cases the air is blown in co-current of the sprayed liquid. The powders obtained with such type of dryers are fine with a lot of dusts and a poor flowability. In order to reduce the dusts and increase the flowability of the powders, there is since over 20 years a new generation of spray dryers called multiple effect spray dryers. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, the drying is done through two steps: one at the top (as per single effect) and one for an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The integration of this fluidized bed allows, by fluidizing the powder inside a humid atmosphere, to agglomerate the fine particles and to obtain granules having commonly a medium particle size within a range of 100 to 300 µm. Because of this large particle size, these powders are free-flowing.
The fine powders generated by the first stage drying can be recycled in continuous flow either at the top of the chamber (around the sprayed liquid) or at the bottom inside the integrated fluidized bed.
The drying of the powder can be finalized on an external vibrating fluidized bed.
The hot drying gas can be passed as a co-current or counter-current flow to the atomiser direction. The co-current flow enables the particles to have a lower residence time within the system and the particle separator (typically a cyclone device) operates more efficiently. The counter-current flow method enables a greater residence time of the particles in the chamber and usually is paired with a fluidized bed system.

[[Honey possum]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of Western Australia, Possums

The honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) is a tiny Australian marsupial weighing just 7-11 g for the male, and 8-16 g for the female—about half the weight of a mouse. Their body length ranges from 6.5 cm to 9 cm. They have a typical lifespan between one and two years.[tpl]cite book| last = Branson| first = Andrew| coauthors = Martyn Bramwell, Robin Kerrod, Christopher O'Toole, Steve Parker, John Stidworthy| title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mammals| publisher = Andromeda Oxford| year =1993| pages = 26–27| isbn = 1-871869-16-1 [/tpl]
Its native names are tait and noolbenger. Chambers English Dictionary
The honey possum has no close relatives. It is currently classified as the only member of the genus Tarsipes and of the family Tarsipedidae, but many authorities[tpl]who|date=December 2010[/tpl] believe it is sufficiently distinct to be more properly raised to a separate superfamily within the Diprotodontia, or perhaps even further. It is thought to be the sole survivor of an otherwise long-extinct marsupial group. Although restricted to a fairly small range in the southwest of Western Australia, it is locally common and does not seem to be threatened with extinction so long as its habitat of heath, shrubland and woodland remains intact and diverse.
It is one of the very few entirely nectarivorous mammals; it has a long, pointed snout and a long, protusible tongue with a brush tip that gathers pollen and nectar, like a honeyeater or a hummingbird. Its teeth are fewer and smaller than is typical for marsupials, with the molars reduced to tiny cones, and a dental formula of [tpl]dentition|2.1.1.3|1.0.0.3[/tpl]
Floral diversity is particularly important for the honey possum, as it cannot survive without a year-round supply of nectar and, unlike nectarivorous birds, it cannot easily travel long distances in search of fresh supplies. Radio-tracking has shown, however, that males particularly are quite mobile, moving distances of up to 0.5 km in a night and with use areas averaging 0.8 hectares.Bradshaw, S. D. & Bradshaw, F. J. (2002) Short-term movements and habitat utilisation of the marsupial honey possum, Tarsipes rostratus. Journal of Zoology (London) 258, 343-348. Both its front and back feet are adept at grasping, enabling it to climb trees with ease, as well as traverse the undergrowth at speed. The honey possum can also use its tail (which is longer than its head and body combined) to grip, much like another arm.
The honey possum is mainly nocturnal, but will come out to feed during daylight in cooler weather. Generally, though, it spends the days asleep in a shelter of convenience: a rock cranny, a tree cavity, the hollow inside of a grass tree, or an abandoned bird nest. When food is scarce, or in cold weather, it becomes torpid to conserve energy.

[[Conservation of mass]]

CATEGORIES: Mass, Conservation laws

The law of conservation of mass, or principle of mass conservation, states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy (both of which have mass), the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as system mass cannot change quantity if it is not added or removed. Hence, the quantity of mass is "conserved" over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form, as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed. The law implies (requires) that during any chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or radioactive decay in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants or starting materials must be equal to the mass of the products.
The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. Historically, mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century, and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry.
The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory, but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations, even in modern practice.
In special relativity, needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved, the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important, since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems, i.e. those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment. In this circumstance, the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation, which is the first law of thermodynamics. By contrast, for a thermodynamically closed system (i.e., one which is closed to exchanges of matter, but open to exchanges of non-material energy, such as heat and work, with the surroundings) mass is (usually) only approximately conserved. The input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory, although the change is usually small, since relatively large amounts of such energy (by comparison with ordinary experience) carry only a small amount of mass (again by ordinary standards of measurement).
In special relativity, mass is not converted to energy, since mass and energy cannot be destroyed, and energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation to a different type of energy within a system (or translocation into or out of a system). Certain types of matter (a different concept) may be created or destroyed, but in all of these processes, the energy and mass associated with such matter remains unchanged in quantity (although type of energy associated with the matter may change form).
In general relativity, mass (and energy) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space. For a discussion, see mass in general relativity.

Alberto Gerchunoff (January 1, 1883–March 2, 1950), was an Argentine writer born in the Russian Empire, in the city of Proskuriv, now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine.  His family emigrated in 1889 to the agricultural colony of Moises Ville. His father, Rab Gershon ben Abraham Gerchunoff was murdered by a gaucho on February 12, 1891. After a few months the family moved to Rajil, founded by philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch as a haven for Jews fleeing the pogroms of Europe. Later, he lived in Buenos Aires. Jorge Luis Borges described him thus:
Although he worked primarily as a journalist for Argentina's leading newspaper La Nación, he also wrote many important novels and books on Jewish life in Latin America, including The Jewish Gauchos of the Pampas (ISBN 0-8263-1767-7), which was later produced into a movie.

The 1884 World's Fair was held in New Orleans, Louisiana. At a time when nearly one third of all cotton produced in the United States was handled in New Orleans and the city was home to the Cotton Exchange, the idea for the fair was first advanced by the Cotton Planters Association. The name World Cotton Centennial referred to the earliest surviving record of export of a shipment of cotton from the United States to England in 1784. It was also known as the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition. 
The U.S. Congress lent $1 million to the Fair's directors and gave $300,000 for the construction of a large US Government & State Exhibits Hall on the site.[tpl]cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A.

It was illuminated with 5,000 electric lights (still a novelty at the time, and said to be 10 times the number then existing in New Orleans outside of the fairgrounds). There was also a Horticultural Hall, an observation tower with electric elevators, and working examples of multiple designs of experimental electric street-cars. The Mexican exhibit was particularly lavish and popular, constructed at a cost of $200,000 dollars, and featuring a huge brass band that was a great hit locally. http://books.google.com/books?id=1yO_xTg2VTIC&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=%22Mexican+Band%22+Fair+%22New+Orleans%22&source=bl&ots=qvHRm4hWoh&sig=2N3fH59ddNtuAlUtuLv4S33UriU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v0WzUeaYNseqyQHOioD4Ag&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Mexican%20Band%22%20Fair%20%22New%20Orleans%22&f=false http://hill.blogs.lib.lsu.edu/2011/10/mexican-music-in-19th-century-new-orleans/
On December 16, 1884, U.S. president Chester Arthur opened the Fair via telegraph (two weeks behind schedule). It closed on June 2, 1885.

Dalmatian (or Dalmatic) was a Romance language spoken in the Dalmatia region of Croatia, and as far south as Kotor in Montenegro. The name refers to a pre-Roman tribe of the Illyrian linguistic group, Dalmatae. The Ragusan dialect of Dalmatian was the official language of the Republic of Ragusa, though in later times Italian (representing the Romance language population) or Serbo-Croatian (for the Slavophone population) came to supersede it.

Thermopylae ([tpl]IPAc-en|θ|ər|ˈ|m|ɒ|p|ɨ|l|iː[/tpl]; Ancient and Katharevousa Greek [tpl]lang|grc|Θερμοπύλαι[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-el|tʰermopýlai|[/tpl], Demotic Θερμοπύλες [tpl]IPA-el|θermoˈpiles|[/tpl]: "hot gateways") is a location in Greece where a narrow coastal passage existed in antiquity. It derives its name from its hot sulphur springs."Thermopylae" in: S. Hornblower & A. Spawforth (eds.) The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed. (Oxford, 1996). "Hot gates" is also "the place of hot springs and cavernous entrances to Hades".L.H. Jeffery (1976) Archaic Greece: The City States c. 700–500 BC. Ernest Benn Ltd., London & Tonbridge p. 73. ISBN 0-510-03271-0
Thermopylae is primarily known for the battle that took place there between the Greek forces including the Spartans and the Persian forces, spawning the famous epitaph beginning with "Go tell the Spartans". It is on the only land route large enough to bear any significant traffic between Lokris and Thessaly. Passage from north to south along the east coast of the Balkan peninsula requires use of the pass. Further west the way is blocked by mountains and the Gulf of Corinth. For this reason the area has been the site of several battles.
The ancient name of the region was Malis after the Malians  ([tpl]lang-grc|Μαλιεῖς[/tpl]),  a Greek tribe that resided at the mouth of the river Spercheios in Greece. The Malian Gulf is named after them. In the western valley of the Spercheios, their land was adjacent to the Aenianes. Their main town was Trachis. In the town of Anthela, the Malians had an important temple of Demeter, an early centre of the Anthelan Amphictiony.
The area is dominated by the coastal floodplain of the Spercheios River, surrounded by steeply sloping forested limestone mountains. The continuous deposition of sediment from the river and travertine deposits from the hot springs has substantially altered the landscape during the past few thousand years. The land surface on which the famous Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 BC is now buried under [tpl]convert|20|m|ft[/tpl] of soil. The shoreline has advanced greatly over the centuries because of the sedimentary deposition. The level of the Malian Gulf was significantly higher during prehistoric times and the Spercheios was significantly shorter. The shoreline advanced by up to 2 kilometers between 2500 BC and 480 BC but still left several extremely narrow passages between the sea and the mountains. The narrowest point on the plain, where the Battle of Thermopylae was probably fought, would have been less than [tpl]convert|100|m|ft[/tpl] wide. Between 480 BC and the 21st century, the shoreline advanced by as much as [tpl]convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in places, eliminating the narrowest points of the pass and considerably increasing the size of the plain around the outlet of the Spercheios.Rapp, George Robert; Hill, Christopher L. Geoarchaeology: The Earth-science Approach to Archaeological Interpretation, p. 96. Yale University Press, 2006. ISBN 0-300-10966-0
A main highway now splits the pass, with a modern-day monument to King Leonidas I of Sparta on the east side of the highway. It is directly across the road from the hill where Simonides of Ceos's epitaph is engraved in stone at the top. Thermopylae is part of the infamous "horseshoe of Maliakos" also known as the "horseshoe of death": it is the narrowest part of the highway connecting the north and the south of Greece.  It has many turns and has been the site of many vehicular accidents.
The hot springs from which the pass derives its name still exist close to the foot of the hill.

A blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects from wrought iron or steel by forging the metal by using tools to hammer, bend, and cut (cf. whitesmith). Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons.
While there are many people who work with metal such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.

For legal purposes motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including automobiles or cars, buses, motorcycles, off highway vehicles, light trucks or light duty trucks, and trucks or lorries. These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country.  ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=9389|title=ISO 3833:1977|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=2011-08-22[/tpl]
As of 2010 there were more than one billion motor vehicles in use in the world excluding off-road vehicles and heavy construction equipment. Global vehicle ownership per capita in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation per 1000 people. The United States has the largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world, with 239.8 million in 2010. Vehicle ownership per capita in the U.S. is also the highest in the world with 769 vehicles in operation per 1000 people. The People's Republic of China has the second largest fleet in the world, with slightly more than 78 million vehicles and since 2009 became the world's largest new car market. In 2011, a total of 80 million cars and commercial vehicles were built, led by China, with 18.4 million motor vehicles manufactured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1074667_80-million-vehicles-built-globally-last-year--a-new-record|title=80 Million Vehicles Built Globally Last Year - A New Record |author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl]

[[Algorithmic efficiency]]

CATEGORIES: Analysis of algorithms, Computer performance, Software optimization

In computer science, algorithmic efficiency are the properties of an algorithm which relate to the amount of resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analysed to determine its resource usage. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process.
For maximum efficiency we wish to minimize resource usage. However, the various resources (e.g. time, space) can not be compared directly, so which of two algorithms is considered to be more efficient often depends on which measure of efficiency is being considered as the most important, e.g. is the requirement for high speed, or for minimum memory usage, or for some other measure?

[[Dedekind domain]]

CATEGORIES: Commutative algebra, Algebraic number theory

In abstract algebra, a Dedekind domain or Dedekind ring, named after Richard Dedekind, is an integral domain in which every nonzero proper ideal factors into a product of prime ideals.  It can be shown that such a factorization is then necessarily unique up to the order of the factors.  There are at least three other characterizations of Dedekind domains which are sometimes taken as the definition: see below.
A field is a commutative ring in which there are no nontrivial proper ideals, so that any field is a Dedekind domain, however in a rather vacuous way.  Some authors add the requirement that a Dedekind domain not be a field.  Many more authors state theorems for Dedekind domains with the implicit proviso that they may require trivial modifications for the case of fields. 
An immediate consequence of the definition is that every principal ideal domain (PID) is a Dedekind domain.  In fact a Dedekind domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD) if and only if it is a PID.

[[Village sign]]

CATEGORIES: English culture, Street furniture, History of Norfolk

In many parts of southern England an ornamental village sign is erected to announce the village name to those entering the village.  They are typically placed on the principal road entrance or in a prominent location such as a village green.  The design often depicts a particularly characteristic feature of the village or a scene from its history, heritage, or culture.  They are typically made of wood or metal or a combination of both, the designs are often made by the local community.
Ornamental timber and iron signs were common historically to identify buildings of importance such as inns or town halls.  However, the tradition of village signs is believed to have started in Norfolk early in the 20th century when Edward VII suggested that village signs would aid motorists and give a feature of interest on the Sandringham Estate. 
The spread of interest beyond Norfolk can be attributed to  Prince Albert, Duke of York who gave a speech to the Royal Academy in 1920 promoting the wider use of village signs.  This prompted the Daily Mail to run a nationwide village sign competition.The Builder magazine, 7 May 1920, p 542 The prize fund exceeded £2,000 and ten awards were made.  The winning schemes were exhibited at Australia House, London in October 1920.The Builder magazine, 22 October 1920, p 455
The village sign at Biddenden, Kent, featuring the two Biddenden Maids, was one of the successful Daily Mail competition entries.  So too was the sign at Bromley, Kent.
In 1924, King George VI recommended that the old custom of identifying villages with carved or painted name signs could be revived.
Many signs commemorate significant events such as the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the passing of Millennium or local celebrations such as the centenary of the formation of local councils.
In some places village signs have been surveyed and recorded.  In Kent signs have been erected in more than half of the county villages have been identified.Alan Bignell Books, Kent Village Signs (Book 1 and Book2), ISBN 978-0-9542950-4-2
In 1929, Harry Carter, an art and woodwork master at Hamonds Grammar School (which now serves as the sixth form buildings for Hamond's high school in Swaffham), carved a sign for his home town. By the time of his death in 1983 he had carved over 200 town and village signs.
While the practice is now widespread, decorative village signs are still common in Norfolk and in the neighbouring county of Suffolk as well as Essex and other East Anglian counties. Some village signs are take the form of sculptures, such as the sign at Capel St Andrew in Suffolk, which is constructed from scrap metal.

In the Domesday Book, Worstead is called Wrdesteda and Ordested. King Canute gave the village to the abbots of St. Benet's Abbey on the River Bure in the Norfolk Broads.
The village became very prosperous from the twelfth century when weavers from Flanders arrived in the area. They had been encouraged to settle in Norfolk by King Edward III of England who had married a Flemish princess.
Worsted cloth derives its name from this weaving heritage, although it is no longer manufactured in the village and the last weaver, John Cubitt, died in 1882 at the age of 91. The oldest Act of Parliament kept in the House of Lords Record Office is the Taking of Apprentices for Worsteads in the County of Norfolk Act of 1497.

CATEGORIES: Spinning, Woven fabrics, Animal hair products

Worsted [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|s|t|ɨ|d[/tpl] is a type of yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the  English county of Norfolk. This village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, became a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds; and weavers from Flanders moved to Norfolk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://worsteadpc.norfolkparishes.gov.uk/category/worstead-heritage-trail/ |title=WORSTEAD HERITAGE TRAIL | Worstead Parish Council |publisher=Worsteadpc.norfolkparishes.gov.uk |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] 
Worsted was made from the long-staple pasture wool from sheep breeds such as Teeswaters, Old Leicester Longwool and Romney Marsh. Pasture wool was not carded: instead it was washed, gilled and combed using heated long-tooth metal combs, oiled and spun. When woven, worsteds were scoured but not fulled.[tpl]cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Geraint|title=The wool textile industry in Great Britain|publisher=Routledge Keegan Paul|year=1972|pages=26–33|chapter=2:|isbn=0710069790[/tpl]

Atropine is a naturally occurring tropane alkaloid extracted from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum)  and other plants of the family Solanaceae. It is a secondary metabolite of these plants and serves as a drug with a wide variety of effects.
In general, atropine counters the "rest and digest" activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Atropine dilates the pupils, increases heart rate, and reduces salivation and other secretions.
It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.[tpl]cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|page=6|date=October 2013[/tpl]

[[Parallel computing]]

CATEGORIES: Parallel computing

Parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously,[tpl]cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Allan|title=Highly parallel computing|year=1989|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|location=Redwood City, Calif.|isbn=0-8053-0177-1|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|coauthors=Almasi, George S.[/tpl] operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel"). There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.S.V. Adve et al. (November 2008). "Parallel Computing Research at Illinois: The UPCRC Agenda" (PDF). Parallel@Illinois, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "The main techniques for these performance benefits – increased clock frequency and smarter but increasingly complex architectures – are now hitting the so-called power wall. The computer industry has accepted that future performance increases must largely come from increasing the number of processors (or cores) on a die, rather than making a single core go faster." As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,Asanovic et al. Old wisdom: Power is free, but transistors are expensive. New wisdom is that power is expensive, but transistors are "free". parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006). "The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley" (PDF). University of California, Berkeley. Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2006-183. "Old wisdom: Increasing clock frequency is the primary method of improving processor performance. New wisdom: Increasing parallelism is the primary method of improving processor performance ... Even representatives from Intel, a company generally associated with the 'higher clock-speed is better' position, warned that traditional approaches to maximizing performance through maximizing clock speed have been pushed to their limit."
Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.
Parallel computer programs are more difficult to write than sequential ones,[tpl]cite book|last=Hennessy|first=John L.|title=Computer organization and design : the hardware/software interface|year=1999|publisher=Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-55860-428-6|edition=2. ed., 3rd print.|coauthors=Patterson, David A., Larus, James R.[/tpl] because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.
The maximum possible speed-up of a single program as a result of parallelization is known as Amdahl's law.

ASCI White was a supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California.
It was a computer cluster based on IBM's commercial RS/6000 SP computer. 512 of these machines were connected together for ASCI White, with 16 processors per node and 8,192 375 MHz processors in total with 6 terabytes of memory and 160 terabytes of disk storage. It was almost exclusively used for large-scale computations requiring dozens, hundreds or thousands of processors. The computer weighed 106 tons and consumed 3 MW of electricity with a further 3 MW needed for cooling. It had a theoretical processing speed of 12.3 teraflops. The system ran IBM's AIX operating system.
ASCI White was made up of three individual systems, the 512 node White, the 28 node Ice and the 68 node Frost.
The system was built in Poughkeepsie, New York. Completed in June 2000 it was transported to specially built facilities in California and officially dedicated on August 15, 2001The World's Fastest Computer - Meeting the Challenge of Stockpile Stewardship. Claimed performance was 12,300 gigaflops, although this was not achieved in the widely accepted LINPACK tests. The system cost $110 million.
It was built as stage three of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) started by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to build a simulator to replace live WMD testing following the moratorium on testing started by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and extended by Bill Clinton in 1993.
The machine was decommissioned beginning July 27, 2006.

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom implemented to comply with the Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds and still in force [tpl]As of|2011|lc=on[/tpl]. In short, the act gives protection to native species (especially those at threat), controls the release of non-native species, enhances the protection of SSSIs and builds upon the rights of way rules in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Act is split into 4 parts covering 74 sections, it also includes 17 schedules.
The legislation has strength; few amendments have been made to it, and it has acted as a foundation for later legislation to build upon. The compulsory 5 year review of schedules 5 and 8 make it dynamic in terms of the species which it protects.

Sharashka (sometimes Sharaga or Sharazhka, [tpl]lang-ru|шара́жка[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ru|ʂɐˈraʂkə[/tpl]) was an informal name for secret research and development laboratories in the Soviet Gulag labor camp system. Etymologically, the word sharashka is derived from a Russian slang expression sharashkina kontora ("Sharashka's office", which in its turn comes from the criminal argot term "шарага" for a band of thiefs, hoodlums, etc. Словарь русского арго), an ironic, derogatory term to denote a poorly organized, impromptu, or bluffing organization. Official name was ОКБ that is Опытное конструкторское бюро that can be translated as "Experimental Design Bureau".
The scientists and engineers at a sharashka were prisoners picked from various camps and prisons and assigned to  work on scientific and technological problems for the state. Living conditions were usually much better than in an average taiga camp, especially bearing in mind the absence of hard labor. 
The results of the research in sharashkas were usually published under the names of prominent Soviet scientists without credit given to the real authors, whose names frequently have been forgotten. Some of the brilliant scientists and engineers imprisoned in sharashkas were released during and after World War II, continuing independent careers and becoming world-famous, such as Léon Theremin.

Metallic hydrogen is a phase of hydrogen in which it behaves as an electrical conductor.

At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some of the newly discovered extrasolar planets.

[[East Frisian Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Islands of Germany, East Frisia, East Frisian Islands

The East Frisian Islands (German: Ostfriesische Inseln) are a chain of islands in the North Sea, off the coast of East Frisia in Lower Saxony, Germany. The islands extend for some [tpl]convert|90|km|mi[/tpl] from west to east between the mouths of the Ems and Jade / Weser rivers and lie about 3.5 to 10 km offshore. Between the islands and the mainland are extensive mudflats, known locally as Watten, which form part of the Wadden Sea. In front of the islands are Germany's territorial waters, which occupy a much larger area than the islands themselves. The islands, the surrounding mudflats and the territorial waters (The Küstenmeer vor den ostfriesischen Inseln  nature reserve) form a close ecological relationship. The island group makes up about 5% of the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park.
The largest island by surface area is Borkum, located at the western end of the chain; the other six inhabited islands are from west to east: Juist, Norderney with the largest town in the islands, Baltrum, Langeoog, Spiekeroog and Wangerooge. There are also four other small, uninhabited islands: Lütje Hörn east of Borkum, Memmert and Kachelotplate southwest of Juist, Minsener Oog, a dredged island southeast of Wangerooge, and Mellum at the eastern end of the island chain which, following the boundary revision by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, no longer belongs to the East Frisian Islands, but to the mudflats of the Elbe-Weser Triangle (Watten im Elbe-Weser-Dreieck).

[[Malapropism]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics, Speech error

A malapropism (also called a Dogberryism) is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, often humorous utterance. An example is Yogi Berra's statement: "Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"[tpl]cite web | title = Great Quotes | url = http://www.great-quotes.com/quote/12877 | accessdate = 2011-09-28 | quote = Texas has a lot of electrical votes[/tpl] rather than "electoral votes".
The word malapropism comes ultimately from the French mal à propos meaning "inappropriate" via "Mrs. Malaprop", a character in the Richard Brinsley Sheridan comedy The Rivals (1775) who habitually misused her words. Dogberryism comes from "Officer Dogberry", the name of a character in the William Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing. These are the two best-known fictional characters who made this kind of error—there are many other examples. Malapropisms also occur as errors in natural speech. Malapropisms are often the subject of media attention, especially when made by politicians or other prominent individuals.
The philosopher Donald Davidson has noted that malapropisms show how complex the process is by which the brain translates thoughts into language.

The benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish Seville orange, Citrus aurantium var. aurantium, prized for its high pectin content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the marmalade.
Marmalade is generally distinguished from jam by its fruit peel. It may also be distinguished from jam by the fruits used.

The African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, usually called "the A.U.M.P. Church," is a Methodist Christian denomination and the oldest independent black denomination in the U.S.  It was chartered by Peter Spencer (1782–1843) in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1813 as the "Union Church of Africans."  It was usually called the "African Union Church" until a Maryland offshoot of the A.M.E. Church (the "First Colored Methodist Protestant Church") merged into it in 1866, when the denomination added that church's name to its own.  A schism in the 1860s caused some of the congregations to form the "Union American Methodist Episcopal Church" in 1865.  The two denominations are now referred to collectively as the "Spencer Churches" (or, less often, the "Union Churches").
Although it was a Methodist Protestant church in its earlier years, by the 1880s the A.U.M.P. Church was considering adopting an episcopal structure, and in 1922 it consecrated its first bishop, Daniel Russell, Jr.  But it was not until 1967 that the Church actually made the switch to the episcopal structure and consecrated its two leaders as bishops.
The A.U.M.P. Church currently has a total of about 40 congregations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 is a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council on 8 November 2002, offering Iraq under Saddam Hussein "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" that had been set out in several previous resolutions (Resolution 660, Resolution 661, Resolution 678, Resolution 686, Resolution 687, Resolution 688, Resolution 707, Resolution 715, Resolution 986, and Resolution 1284).http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/resolution.text/
Resolution 1441 stated that Iraq was in material breach of the ceasefire terms presented under the terms of Resolution 687. Iraq's breaches related not only to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), but also the known construction of prohibited types of missiles, the purchase and import of prohibited armaments, and the continuing refusal of Iraq to compensate Kuwait for the widespread looting conducted by its troops during the 1990–1991 invasion and occupation. It also stated that "...false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations."

The Canon of Medicine ([tpl]lang-ar|القانون في الطب[/tpl] al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb) is an encyclopedia of medicine in five books compiled by Persian philosopher Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) and completed in 1025.[tpl]Cite book|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514694-8|page=70|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] It presents a clear and organized summary of all the medical knowledge of the time. It is a "magisterial exposition of Galenic medicine", although while Avicenna accepted Galen's evidence on anatomical matters he preferred Aristotle's theories where they differed from Galen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x|title=Enyclopedia Iranica; Avicenna: Medicine and Biology|accessdate=20 December 2013[/tpl] It served as a more concise reference in contrast to Galen's twenty volumes of medical corpus.[tpl]cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Avicenna|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533147-9|page=228[/tpl] 
As part of the Arabic translation project Ibn-Sina drew on various sources in the writing of his Canon an important one being the extensive pathology text from Chinese medicine called the Zhubing Yuanhuo Lun written in about 610 by Chao Yuan-fang. Ibn-Sina also drew on the early Chinese pulse diagnosis classic text the Maijing by Wang Shu-hu which was written in circa 310.Fu Wei-kang (ed.) Zhongguo Yixue Shi (History of Chinese Medicine) Publishing House of Shanghai College of Chinese Medicine 1989
Originally written in the Arabic language, the book was later translated into a number of other languages, including Persian, Latin, Chinese, Hebrew, German, French, and English with many commentaries.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman|title=Qanoon lbn Sina Aur Uskey Shareheen wa Mutarjemeen|year = 1986 |publisher= Publication Division, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia|author=Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman|title=Qanun Ibn Sina and its Translation and Commentators (Persian Translation; 203pp)|year = 2004 |publisher= Society for the Appreciation of Cultural Works and Dignitaries, Tehran, Iran[/tpl] The Canon is considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine|title="The Canon of Medicine" (work by Avicenna)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|accessdate=11 June 2008[/tpl]
The word Canon in the title derives from the cognate Arabic original Qanun (the English word "canon" comes from Latin canōn, from Ancient Greek κανών (kanón, "measuring rod, standard"), while the Arabic word "qanun" comes directly from the same Ancient Greek root). The Canon of Medicine remained a medical authority for centuries. It set the standards for medicine in Medieval Europe and the Islamic world, and is Avicenna's most renowned written work. Qanun was used at many medical schools; at University of Montpellier, France, it was used as late as 1650.The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna), Encyclopædia Britannica The Canon was used as a medical textbook through the 18th century in Europe.[tpl]cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Avicenna|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533147-9|page=227[/tpl] It is used in Unani (Ionian) medicine, a form of traditional medicine practiced in India.

It is often regarded as a division  of ecology or environmental science. It covers the biological, chemical, physical, geological, and other attributes of all inland waters (running and standing waters, both fresh and saline, natural or man-made). This includes the study of lakes and ponds, rivers, springs, streams and wetlands.Wetzel, R.G. 2001. Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems, 3rd ed. Academic Press (ISBN 0-12-744760-1) A more recent sub-discipline of limnology, termed landscape limnology, studies, manages, and conserves these aquatic ecosystems using a landscape perspective.
Limnology is closely related to aquatic ecology and hydrobiology, which study aquatic organisms in particular regard to their hydrological environment.

Swarthmore College is a private liberal arts college in the United States with an enrollment of 1,545 students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/SwarthmoreCollege.aspx |title=Swarthmore College |publisher=Princeton Review |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2011-06-21[/tpl]
The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia. 
Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a Committee of Quakers from three Hicksite yearly meetings: Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia.  Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/SCArchives/Biographies2.htm |title=Swarthmore College: About the Founders... |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]  Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/index1.html |title=An Onward Spirit: A Brief History of Swarthmore College |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl] By 1906 Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.
Today, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of its Quaker heritage."A glance at Swarthmore's Quaker roots”, The Daily Gazette.   Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school, and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, rates among the highest of US institutions.
Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford Colleges. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.Swarthmore: Quick Facts”, Swarthmore College website, June 2008.

Batman ([tpl]lang-ku|Êlih[/tpl]) is a city in the Southeastern Anatolia Region of Turkey and the capital of Batman Province. It lies on a plateau, 540 meters above sea level, near the confluence of the Batman River and the Tigris. The Batı Raman oil field, which is the largest oil field in Turkey, is located just outside the city. Batman has a local airport and a military airbase, which was used for transit of aircraft and helicopters in some search and rescue operations of the Gulf War.
Until the 1950s, Batman was a village called Iluh with a population of about 3,000. However, oil fields were discovered around it in the 1940s that resulted in a rapid development of the area and in the inflow of workforce from other parts of Turkey. In 1957, the village was renamed into Batman, after the river namesake, received a city status and became a district center. Over the next 50 years, Batman was rebuilt from one-storey to multi-storeyed buildings and its population grew 100-fold. A [tpl]convert|511|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] km long oil pipeline was brought in 1967 from Batman to the port city of Dörtyol near the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast to transport the crude oil from the Batman refinery. In 1990, the city became the capital of Batman Province.
Apart from oil, which is by far the dominant commodity of the region, Batman produces beverages, processed food, chemicals, furniture, footwear, machinery and transport equipment. A university was established here in 2007 and became part of the Erasmus foreign student exchange program.

[[Batman River]]

CATEGORIES: Tigris River, Rivers of Turkey, Geography of Batman Province

The Batman River is a major tributary of the Tigris, joining it near the source of Tigris called Dicle River in southeast Turkey. It originates in the Anti-Taurus Mountains (at the Sason and Genç mountains) and flows approximately from north to south, passing near the city of Batman and forming a natural border between the Batman Province and Diyarbakır Province. The historic Malabadi Bridge (built in 1146–1147) crosses the river near the town of Silvan.Batman. Coğrafya, kultur.gov.tr, 21 February 2007 (in Turkish) The region along the Batman River is known for its oil fields. The Batman Dam ([tpl]lang-tr|Batman Baraji[/tpl], B. de Batman on the map) was built in 1999 in the upstream ([tpl]coord|38.160088|N|41.201574|E|source:frwiki_region:TR_type:landmark|format=dms[/tpl]), together with the associated reservoir and hydroelectric power plant.Batman DamBatman Dam, General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works
The river is widest at about 100 m right after exiting the dam, but then narrows to about 50 metres and forms numerous splits along its way to the Tigris. Its riverbed is irregular in many places that promotes flooding. A tributary of Batman, the Iluh River, originates in the Raman Mountain on the south of the Batman city and flows north-west through the city into the Batman River. Despite being a small river, absent on most maps, Iluh plays an important role for the province because its spring floods affect the provincial capital. The floods of Iluh and Batman rivers occur between March and May and sometimes in October–November. Major floods occurred in 1969 (April, 60 buildings damaged), 1972 (April and May, 210 buildings damaged), 1991 (November, 500 buildings flooded), 1995 (March, nearly 1000 buildings submerged and 450 damaged) and 2006 (October, 11 people died and 20 injured).Balaban, Meltem Şenol Risk society and planning: the case of flood disaster management in turkish cities.

[[.177 caliber]]

CATEGORIES: Ammunition

.177 caliber (4.5mm) is the smallest size of pellets widely used in air guns, and is the only caliber generally accepted for formal target competition.  It is also sometimes used for hunting small game, and in field target competition, where it competes with .20 caliber (5 mm) and .22 caliber (5.5 mm) rifles. Compared with a .22 pellet, the .177  travels faster and on a flatter trajectory. This is the reason for it being used in target competitions as the competitor does not have to adjust for drop very much .[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] In hunting, the .177 is in general inferior to .22 caliber pellets as it is smaller thus causing less impact damage. Heavier pellets can however increase its effectiveness.
Steel BB shot is [tpl]convert|0.175|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] diameter.  Some air guns are designed to accept .177 pellets, or .177 lead shot, or .175 steel BBs interchangeably.
The .17 caliber (actually [tpl]convert|0.172|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] or 4.37 mm diameter) is the smallest size bullet that is widely available for use in firearms, both in rimfire (.17 HMR) and centerfire (.17 Remington) ammunition.  Production of .14 caliber barrels, rifles and bullets is a cottage industry in the USA, while .12 and .10 caliber rifles have been made on an experimental basis.

It lies [tpl]convert|18|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of the county town of Exeter and [tpl]convert|28|mi|km|0[/tpl] east-north-east of Plymouth, on the north of Tor Bay, adjoining the neighbouring town of Paignton on the west of the bay and across from the fishing port of Brixham. In the 2011 UK Census, Torquay's population was 65,245, about half of that of the whole of Torbay.
The town's economy, like Brixham's, was initially based upon fishing and agriculture, but in the early 19th century the town began to develop into a fashionable seaside resort, initially frequented by members of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars while the Royal Navy anchored in the bay. Later, as the town's fame spread, it was popular with the crème de la crème of Victorian society. Renowned for its healthful climate, the town earned the nickname of the English Riviera and favourable comparisons to Montpellier.
Torquay was the home of the writer Agatha Christie, who was born in the town and lived there during her early years. The town contains an "Agatha Christie Mile", a tour with plaques dedicated to her life and work.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/outdoors/walks/agatha_walk.shtml | title= Go on a mystery walk in beautiful Torquay | publisher= BBC | accessdate= 18 February 2010[/tpl]

[[Ebroin]]

CATEGORIES: 680s deaths, Frankish people, Mayors of the Palace, Year of birth unknown

Ebroin (died 680 or 681) was the Frankish mayor of the palace of Neustria on two occasions; firstly from 658 to his deposition in 673 and secondly from 675 to his death in 680 or 681.  In a violent and despotic career, he strove to impose the authority of Neustria, which was under his control, over Burgundy and Austrasia.
Following the failed coup of the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder in Austrasia, the Merovingian court resided in Neustria. According to the Liber historiae Francorum, during the reign of Chlothar III the mayor Erchinoald of Neustria died. A council of Franks then elected Ebroin as his replacement.
The Life of Saint Eligius records that as of the middle 670s Ebroin had only one child, a son named Bobo; Bobo was then convalescing from an illness contracted during his adolescence. Based on that, Bobo was likely born c. 660.
The Venerable Bede (IV.1) took notice of an anecdote concerning Ebroin in 668. Bede tells that Ebroin waylaid an Englishman returning from Rome, for fear that the Byzantine Emperor (Constans II, residing in Syracuse (Sicily)) was plotting an alliance against his rule. It follows that Ebroin by 668 had arrogated to himself the de facto rule of Neustria and so (in theory) "of the Franks"; it also follows that Ebroin had a streak of paranoia.
It remains unclear how direct was Ebroin's influence over the next four years (the Liber historiae may imply that Chlothar had roused himself by then), but when Chlothar died in 673 Ebroin was back in charge. Another brother Theuderic III was raised as king of Neustria, still viewed as the core kingdom "of the Franks".
Ebroin endeavoured to maintain at any rate the union of Neustria and Burgundy, but the great Burgundian nobles too wished to remain independent. They rose under bishop Leodegar (or Léger) of Autun, and defeated Ebroin and Theuderic. They decided to tonsure Ebroin, interning him in the monastery of Luxeuil. A proclamation was then issued to the effect that each kingdom should keep its own laws and customs, that there should be no further interchange of functionaries between the kingdoms, and that no one should again set up a tyranny like that of Ebroin. Soon, however, Leodegar too was defeated by Wulfoald and the Austrasians, and was himself confined at Luxeuil in 673.
When Childeric II was murdered at Bondi that year, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was reinstalled as king in Neustria with Leudesius as his mayor. Ebroin and Leodegar took advantage of the confusion to leave the cloister, and soon found themselves once more face to face. Each looked for support to a different Merovingian king, Ebroin even proclaiming a false Merovingian imposter as sovereign. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again, now with a score to settle with Leodegar.
About 675 Ebroin reimposed his authority over Neustria and most of Burgundy, and induced the Duke of Champagne and the Bishops of Châlons and Valence to attack Autun. They invested the city, and forced it to surrender. Ebroin had Leodegar's eyes put out. Ebroin persuaded the king that Childeric's murder had occurred under Leodegar's instigation; and so the king had Leodegar additionally arrested, tried, and exiled. In 12 October 678 Ebroin had his enemy led away and murdered.
Ebroin meanwhile had defeated the Austrasians at Bois-du-Fay, near Laon, uniting France under Neustrian rule. His triumph, however, was short-lived; he was assassinated in 681, the victim of a combined attack of his numerous enemies.
In 684, Ansoald, bishop of Poitiers in Neustria, the homeland of Leudesius, commissioned a Life of Leodegar the Burgundian. It cast Ebroin as an enemy of God motivated by nothing but ambition and a lust for power. This biography became canonised in the Church to such an extent that Leodegar, too, was canonised - as Saint Leger. Tales of Ebroin's infamy were also found useful by the Austrasians, whose own ambitious mayoral family commissioned the continuations to the chronicle of Fredegar.

[[Wilfrid]]

Wilfrid (originally spelled Wilfrith;Fraser From Caledonia to Pictland p. 47 c. 633 – c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.
After becoming Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus resolved the situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking up some of the larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore took the opportunity to implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.
Wilfrid spent the next few years in Selsey, where he founded an episcopal see and converted the pagan inhabitants of the Kingdom of Sussex to Christianity. Theodore and Wilfrid settled their differences, and Theodore urged the new Northumbrian king, Aldfrith, to allow Wilfrid's return. Aldfrith agreed to do so, but in 691 he expelled Wilfrid again. Wilfrid went to Mercia, where he helped missionaries and acted as bishop for the Mercian king. Wilfrid appealed to the papacy about his expulsion in 700, and the pope ordered that an English council should be held to decide the issue. This council, held at Austerfield in 702, attempted to confiscate all of Wilfrid's possessions, and so Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal against the decision. His opponents in Northumbria excommunicated him, but the papacy upheld Wilfrid's side, and he regained possession of Ripon and Hexham, his Northumbrian monasteries. Wilfrid died in 709 or 710. After his death, he was venerated as a saint.
Historians then and now have been divided over Wilfrid. His followers commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled a large number of monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.

General Sir William Fenwick Williams, 1st Baronet GCB (4 December 1800 – 26 July 1883) was a Nova Scotian and renowned military leader for the British during the Victorian era. 
He is remembered for his gallant defence of the town of Kars during the Crimean War. He with other British officers inspired the poorly equipped Turkish soldiers to repel Russian attacks by General Murav’ev on the besieged town for three months causing 6,000 Russian casualties. They were forced to surrender due to starvation, disease and shortage of ammunition. However they surrendered on their own terms with the officers being allowed to retain their swords. Williams was imprisoned at Ryazan but he was treated very well and released at the end of the Crimean War in 1856. Before returning home he was introduced to Czar Alexander II. Many other honours were  bestowed upon Sir William and it was particularly fitting that in 1865-7, he was appointed the first Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, where he had been born at the turn of the 19th century. The portrait by William Gush was painted for the Parliament House, Halifax, Nova Scotia and hangs to this day in Province House, Halifax.

Æthelred ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|θ|əl|r|ɛ|d[/tpl]; died after 704) was King of Mercia from 675 until 704. He was the son of Penda of Mercia and came to the throne in 675, when his brother, Wulfhere of Mercia, died.  Within a year of his accession he invaded Kent, where his armies destroyed the city of Rochester. In 679 he defeated his brother-in-law, Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at the Battle of the Trent: the battle was a major setback for the Northumbrians, and effectively ended their military involvement in English affairs south of the Humber. It also permanently returned the kingdom of Lindsey to Mercia's possession. However, Æthelred was unable to re-establish his predecessors' domination of southern Britain.
He was known as a pious and religious king, and he made many grants of land to the church. It was during his reign that Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, reorganized the church's diocesan structure, creating several new sees in Mercia and Northumbria.  Æthelred befriended Bishop Wilfrid of York when Wilfrid was expelled from his see in Northumbria; Æthelred made Wilfrid Bishop of the Middle Angles during his exile and supported him at the synod of Austerfield in about 702, when Wilfrid argued his case for the return of the ecclesiastical lands he had been deprived of in Northumbria.
Æthelred's wife, Osthryth, was a daughter of King Oswiu, one of the dominant 7th-century Northumbrian kings. Osthryth was murdered in unknown circumstances in 697, and in 704 Æthelred abdicated, leaving the throne to Wulfhere's son Coenred. Æthelred became a monk at Bardney, a monastery which he had founded with his wife, and was buried there.  Ceolred, who was Æthelred's son (though apparently not by Osthryth), became king after Coenred; it is also possible that Æthelred had another son named Ceolwald who was briefly king before Ceolred.

(1994) Profile: Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar – Confronting the Final Limit, Scientific American 270(3), 32–33. The Chandrasekhar limit is named after him.
Chandrasekhar - in distinct periods - worked in various areas, including stellar structure, theory of white dwarfs, stellar dynamics, theory of radiative transfer, quantum theory of the negative ion of Hydrogen, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, general relativity, mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves. At Cambridge University, he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun – the Chandrasekhar limit. Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics originated by Jan Oort and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Way on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed ‘dynamical friction’, which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly.
Chandrasekhar studied at Presidency College, Madras and University of Cambridge.  He spent most of his career at the University of Chicago, spending some time in its Yerkes Observatory, and serving as editor of the prestigious Astrophysical Journal (1952–71). He served on the University of Chicago faculty from 1937 until his death in 1995 at the age of 84.
Chandrasekhar married Lalitha Doraiswamy in September 1936.  He had met her as a fellow student at Presidency College, Madras.
Chandrasekhar was the nephew of Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930.

CATEGORIES: Converts to Christianity from pagan religions, Mercian monarchs, 7th-century English monarchs, 675 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Wulfhere or Wulfar (died 675) was King of Mercia from 658 until 675 AD. He was the first Christian king of all of Mercia, though it is not known when or how he converted from Anglo-Saxon paganism. His accession marked the end of Oswiu of Northumbria's overlordship of southern England, and Wulfhere extended his influence over much of that region. His campaigns against the West Saxons led to Mercian control of much of the Thames valley. He conquered the Isle of Wight and the Meon valley and gave them to King Æthelwealh of the South Saxons. He also had influence in Surrey, Essex, and Kent. He married Eormenhild, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent.
Wulfhere's father, Penda, was killed in 655 at the Battle of Winwaed, fighting against Oswiu of Northumbria. Penda's son Peada became king under Oswiu's overlordship but was murdered a year later. Wulfhere came to the throne when Mercian nobles organized a revolt against Northumbrian rule in 658 and drove out Oswiu's governors.
By 670, when Oswiu died, Wulfhere was the most powerful king in southern Britain. He was effectively the overlord of Britain south of the Humber from the early 660s, although not overlord of Northumbria as his father had been. In 674, he challenged Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria, but was defeated. He died, probably of disease, in 675. Wulfhere was succeeded as King of Mercia by his brother, Æthelred. Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid describes Wulfhere as "a man of proud mind, and insatiable will".Colgrave, Life of Bishop Wilfred, c. 20.

Dietrich remained popular throughout her long career by continually re-inventing herself, professionally and characteristically. In the Berlin of the 1920s, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel (1930), directed by Josef von Sternberg, brought her international fame and garnered her a contract with Paramount Pictures in the US. Hollywood films such as Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936) capitalised on her glamour and exotic looks, cementing her stardom and making her one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939,Dietrich applied for US citizenship in 1937 ("Marlene Dietrich to be US Citizen". Painesville Telegraph, 6 March 1937.); it was granted in 1939 (see "Citizen Soon". The Telegraph Herald, 10 March 1939. and "Seize Luggage of Marlene Dietrich". Lawrence Journal World, 14 June 1939). and throughout World War II she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films in the post-war years, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a successful show performer.
In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of all time.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

Penda (died 15 November 655)Manuscript A of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives the year as 655. Bede also gives the year as 655 and specifies a date, 15 November. R. L. Poole (Studies in Chronology and History, 1934) put forward the theory that Bede began his year in September, and consequently November 655 would actually fall in 654; Frank Stenton also dated events accordingly in his Anglo-Saxon England (1943).1 Others have accepted Bede's given dates as meaning what they appear to mean, considering Bede's year to have begun on 25 December or 1 January (see S. Wood, 1983: "Bede's Northumbrian dates again"). The historian D. P. Kirby suggested the year 656 as a possibility, alongside 655, in case the dates given by Bede are off by one year (see Kirby's "Bede and Northumbrian Chronology", 1963). The Annales Cambriae gives the year as 657. Annales Cambriae at Fordham University was a 7th-century King of Mercia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom in what is today the English Midlands. A pagan at a time when Christianity was taking hold in many of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Penda took over the Severn Valley in 628 following the Battle of Cirencester before participating in the defeat of the powerful Northumbrian king Edwin at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633.Bede gives the year of Hatfield as 633 (along with the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle); if the theory that Bede's years began in September is employed (see Note 1), then October 633 would actually be in 632, and this dating has sometimes been observed by modern historians such as Stenton (see Note 8). Kirby suggested that the year may have actually been 634, accounting for the possibility that Bede's dates are one year early (see Note 1). Bede gives the specific date of Hatfield as 12 October; Manuscript E of the Chronicle (see Note 10) gives it as 14 October.
Nine years later, he defeated and killed Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald, at the Battle of Maserfield; from this point he was probably the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon rulers of the time, laying the foundations for the Mercian supremacy over the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. He repeatedly defeated the East Angles and drove Cenwalh the king of Wessex into exile for three years. He continued to wage war against the Bernicians of Northumbria. Thirteen years after Maserfield, he suffered a crushing defeat by Oswald's successor Oswiu and was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed in the course of a final campaign against the Bernicians.

[[Aspect-oriented programming]]

CATEGORIES: Aspect-oriented programming, Aspect-oriented software development, Programming paradigms

In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. AOP forms a basis for aspect-oriented software development.
AOP includes programming methods and tools that support the modularization of concerns at the level of the source code, while "aspect-oriented software development" refers to a whole engineering discipline.
Aspect-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts (so-called concerns, cohesive areas of functionality). Nearly all programming paradigms support some level of grouping and encapsulation of concerns into separate, independent entities by providing abstractions (e.g., functions, procedures, modules, classes, methods) that can be used for implementing, abstracting and composing these concerns. But some concerns defy these forms of implementation and are called crosscutting concerns because they "cut across" multiple abstractions in a program.
Logging exemplifies a crosscutting concern because a logging strategy necessarily affects every logged part of the system. Logging thereby crosscuts all logged classes and methods.
All AOP implementations have some crosscutting expressions that encapsulate each concern in one place. The difference between implementations lies in the power, safety, and usability of the constructs provided. For example, interceptors that specify the methods to intercept express a limited form of crosscutting, without much support for type-safety or debugging. AspectJ has a number of such expressions and encapsulates them in a special class, an aspect. For example, an aspect can alter the behavior of the base code (the non-aspect part of a program) by applying advice (additional behavior) at various join points (points in a program) specified in a quantification or query called a pointcut (that detects whether a given join point matches). An aspect can also make binary-compatible structural changes to other classes, like adding members or parents.

[[Jane Bathori]]

CATEGORIES: 1877 births, 1970 deaths, French opera singers, Operatic mezzo-sopranos, Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery

Jane Bathori (born Jeanne-Marie Berthier, June 14, 1877 - January 25, 1970) was a French opera singer. Born in Paris, France, she was famous on the operatic stage and important in the development of contemporary French music.
Bathori originally studied piano and planned for a career as concert pianist but soon turned to singing, making her professional debut sometime in 1898 at the small Théâtre de la Bodinière in the rue Saint-Lazare in a concert to honor the poet Paul Verlaine. That same year, her debut in the grands concerts began when she appeared at the Concerts du Conservatoire followed by performances in Gabriel Fauré's La Naissance de Vénus and Camille Saint-Saëns' Messe de Requiem.  During the season 1899–1900 she made her mezzo-soprano operatic debut at Nantes.
In the early 1900s, Bathori began studying with Pierre-Émile Engel, whom she married in 1908.  In 1917, she became the director of the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier. After the war she sang at La Scala and in other major centres across Europe.  During the time of Les Six in the early 1920s she played a large role in the propagation of the new music of this period especially by some of the members of the famous Les Six. On January 31, 1920 she gave the  first performance of Louis Durey's Printemps au fond de la mer. She would give the first performances of many works by other contemporary French composers.
In the 1930s she sang in the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Argentina. During the German occupation of France during World War II she would make Buenos Aires her home. After her return to France she taught and coached a number of young singers, working closely with Irène Joachim. Although age put an end to her own concert career, she occasionally appeared in public and on recordings as accompanist.
Jane Bathori died in Paris and is interred in the Funerarium du Cimetière du Père-Lachaise.

José Doroteo Arango Arámbula (5 June 1878 – 20 July 1923) – better known by his pseudonym Francisco Villa or his nickname Pancho Villa – was one of the most prominent Mexican Revolutionary generals.
As commander of the División del Norte (Division of the North), he was the veritable caudillo of the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, which, given its size, mineral wealth, and proximity to the United States of America, provided him with extensive resources. Villa was also provisional Governor of Chihuahua in 1913 and 1914. Although he was prevented from being accepted into the "panteón" of national heroes until some 20 years after his death, today his memory is honored by Mexicans. In addition, numerous streets and neighborhoods in Mexico are named in his honor.
Villa and his supporters seized hacienda land for distribution to peasants and soldiers. He robbed and commandeered trains and, like the other revolutionary generals, printed fiat money to pay for his cause. Villa's men and supporters became known as Villistas during the revolution from 1910 to roughly 1920.
Villa's dominance in northern Mexico was broken in 1915 through a series of defeats he suffered at Celaya and Agua Prieta at the hands of Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles. After Villa's famous raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916, U.S. Army General John J. Pershing tried unsuccessfully to capture Villa in a nine-month pursuit that ended when the United States entered into World War I and Pershing was called back. Villa retired in 1920 and was given a large estate, which he turned into a "military colony" for his former soldiers. In 1923, he decided to reinvolve himself in Mexican politics and as a result was assassinated, most likely on the orders of Obregón.

[[Wave function]]

CATEGORIES: Quantum mechanics, Concepts in physics

A wave function or wavefunction (also named a state function) in quantum mechanics describes the quantum state of a system of one or more particles, and contains all the information about the system. Quantities associated with measurements, like the average momentum of a particle, are derived from the wavefunction. Thus it is a central quantity in quantum mechanics. The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters [tpl]math|ψ[/tpl] or [tpl]math|Ψ[/tpl] (lower-case and capital psi). The Schrödinger equation determines how the wave function evolves over time, that is, the wavefunction is the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves, like water waves or waves on a string, because the Schrödinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation. This explains the name "wave function", and gives rise to wave–particle duality.
The wave function for a given system does not have a unique representation. Most commonly, it is taken to be a function of all the position coordinates of the particles and time, that is, the wavefunction is in "position space". However, we could also consider a wave function in "momentum space"; a function of all the momenta of the particles and time instead. In general, the wave function of a system is a function of continuous and discrete variables characterizing the system's degrees of freedom, and there is one wavefunction for the entire system, not a separate wavefunction for each particle in the system. Elementary particles, like electrons, have spin, and the wavefunction must include this fundamental property as an intrinsic degree of freedom. The wave function is spinorial for fermions, namely particles with half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...), or tensorial for bosons, particles with integer spin (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
In most treatments of quantum mechanics, the wavefunction is complex-valued. In one important interpretation of quantum mechanics called the Copenhagen interpretation, the modulus squared of the wavefunction, [tpl]math|[tpl]abs|ψ[/tpl]2[/tpl], is a real number interpreted as the probability density of finding a particle in a given place at a given time, if the particle's position is to be measured. Since the wavefunction is complex valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured. It does not directly tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables, one has to apply quantum operators to the wave function [tpl]math|ψ[/tpl] and find the eigenvalues which correspond to sets of possible results of measurement. 
However, complex numbers are not necessarily used in all treatments. Louis de Broglie in his later years proposed a real-valued wave function connected to the complex wave function by a proportionality constant and developed the de Broglie–Bohm theory.
The unit of measurement for [tpl]math|ψ[/tpl] depends on the system. For one particle in three dimensions, its units are length−3/2. These unusual units are required so that an integral of [tpl]math|[tpl]abs|ψ[/tpl]2[/tpl] over a region of three-dimensional space is a unitless probability (the probability that the particle is in that region). For different numbers of particles and/or dimensions, the units may be different and can be found by dimensional analysis.[tpl]cite book|pages=1223–1229| author=R.G. Lerner, G.L.

[[Iron ore]]

CATEGORIES: Economic geology, Iron, Iron mining

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.  The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite ([tpl]Chem|Fe|3|O|4[/tpl]), hematite ([tpl]Chem|Fe|2|O|3[/tpl]), goethite ([tpl]Chem|Fe|O|(OH)[/tpl]), limonite ([tpl]Chem|Fe|O|(OH)|.n(H2O)[/tpl]) or siderite ([tpl]Chem|Fe|C|O3[/tpl]).
Ores carrying very high quantities of hematite or magnetite (greater than ~60% iron) are known as "natural ore" or "direct shipping ore", meaning they can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces. Most reserves of such ore have now been depleted. Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron, which is one of the main raw materials to make steel. 98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photoiron.html |title= IRON ORE - Hematite, Magnetite & Taconite |work=Mineral Information Institute |accessdate=7 April 2006[/tpl] Indeed, it has been argued that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity, except perhaps oil".

[[Bilingual pun]]
CATEGORIES: Puns

A bilingual pun is a pun created by a word or phrase in one language sounding similar to a different word or phrase in another language. Bilingual puns are often created by mixing languages, and represent a form of macaronic language.
A general technique in bilingual punning is homophonic translation, which consists of translating a passage from the source language into a homophonic (but likely nonsensical) passage in the target language. This requires the audience to understand both the surface, nonsensical translation as well as the source text – the former then sounds like the latter spoken in a foreign accent.

Audiophile values may be applied at all stages of music reproduction: the initial audio recording, the production process, and the playback, which is usually in a home setting.
"Audiophile" recordings include those using conventional formats but with special attention to audio quality, as well as recordings in high-resolution formats such as Super Audio CD or DVD-Audio. Recently, there has been interest in lossless file formats such as WAV, FLAC, WMA Lossless, and Apple Lossless.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
A key goal of audiophiles is to capture the experience of a live musical performance in a room with good acoustics, and reproduce it at home. It is widely agreed that this is very difficult and that even the best-regarded recording and playback systems rarely, if ever, achieve it.
The term High-end audio refers to playback equipment used by audiophiles, which may be bought at specialist shops and websites. High-end components include turntables, digital-to-analog converters, equalization devices, preamplifiers and amplifiers (both solid-state and vacuum tube), horn and electrostatic speakers, power conditioners, subwoofers, headphones, and acoustic room treatment.

CATEGORIES: Field theory, Algebraic number theory

In mathematics, a local field is a special type of field that is a locally compact topological field with respect to a non-discrete topology.Page 20 of [tpl]Harvnb|Weil|1995[/tpl]
Given such a field, an absolute value can be defined on it. There are two basic types of local field: those in which the absolute value is archimedean and those in which it is not. In the first case, one calls the local field an archimedean local field, in the second case, one calls it a non-archimedean local field. Local fields arise naturally in number theory as completions of global fields.
Every local field is isomorphic (as a topological field) to one of the following:
There is an equivalent definition of non-archimedean local field: it is a field that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and whose residue field is finite. However, some authors consider a more general notion, requiring only that the residue field be perfect, not necessarily finite.See, for example, definition 1.4.6 of [tpl]harvnb|Fesenko|Vostokov|2002[/tpl] This article uses the former definition.

[[Pilaster]]
CATEGORIES: Architectural elements, Columns and entablature

The pilaster is an architectural element in classical architecture used to give the appearance of a supporting column and to articulate an extent of wall, with only an ornamental function. In contrast, an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above.
In discussing Leon Battista Alberti's use of pilasters, which Alberti reintroduced into wall-architecture, Rudolf Wittkower wrote, "The pilaster is the logical transformation of the column for the decoration of a wall. It may be defined as a flattened column which has lost its three-dimensional and tactile value."Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (1962) 1965:36.
A pilaster appears with a capitalA useful phrase to identify a section of pilaster without a capital, with only its fluting to identify its relation to a column, is "pilaster strip". and entablature, also in "low-relief" or flattened against the wall.
Pilasters often appear on the sides of a door frame or window opening on the facade of a building, and are sometimes paired with columns or pillars set directly in front of them at some distance away from the wall, which support a roof structure above, such as a portico. These vertical elements can also be used to support a recessed archivolt around a doorway. The pilaster can be replaced by ornamental brackets supporting the entablature or a balcony over a doorway.
When a pilaster appears at the corner intersection of two walls it is known as a canton.Ching, Francis D. K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. ISBN 0-442-02462-2, p. 266.
As with a column, a pilaster can have a plain or fluted surface to its profile and can be represented in the mode of any architectural style. During the Renaissance and Baroque architects used a range of pilaster forms.[tpl]Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= Mark Jarzombek| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41[/tpl] In the giant order pilasters appear as two-storeys tall, linking floors in a single unit.
The fashion of using this element from Ancient Greek and Roman architecture was adopted in the Italian Renaissance, gained wide popularity with Greek Revival architecture, and continues to be seen in some modern architecture.

[[Ellipsoid]]

CATEGORIES: Geometric shapes, Surfaces, Quadrics

An ellipsoid is a closed  quadric surface that is a three-dimensional analogue of an ellipse. The standard equation of an  ellipsoid centered at the origin  of a Cartesian coordinate system and aligned with the axes is
The points (a,0,0), (0,b,0) and (0,0,c) lie on the surface and the line segments from the origin to these points are called the semi-principal axes of length a, b, c. They correspond to the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the appropriate ellipses.
There are four distinct cases of which one is degenerate:
Mathematical literature often uses 'ellipsoid' in place of 'tri-axial ellipsoid'. Scientific literature (particularly geodesy) often uses 'ellipsoid' in place of 'ellipsoid of revolution' and only applies the adjective 'tri-axial' when treating the  general case. Older literature uses 'spheroid' in place of 'ellipsoid of revolution'.
Any planar cross section passing through the center of an ellipsoid forms an ellipse on its surface: this degenerates to a circle for sections normal to the symmetry axis of an ellipsoid of revolution (or all sections when the ellipsoid degenerates to a sphere.)

[[Servitude (BDSM)]]
CATEGORIES: BDSM terminology

In BDSM, servitude refers to performing personal tasks for their dominant partner, as part of their submissive role in a BDSM relationship.
In domestic servitude roles, the submissive can receive pleasure and satisfaction from performing personal services for their dominant, such as serving as a butler, waitress, chauffeur, maid or houseboy.  
In workplace BDSM, the submissive can somehow secretly contrive that a work colleague, of the same or opposite gender to the submissive, unwittingly finds themselves with imagined or real work-related disciplinary power and/or status over the submissive. The created dominant may never realise they are bringing secret pleasure and satisfaction to the submissive, in the giving of orders or else in rebuking the submissive for supposed performance failings at the workplace, such as "laziness".
The satisfaction of servitude are often combined with the pleasures of fetishes, the pleasures of humiliation, or both. A submissive may rub his or her dominant's feet because the sub enjoys providing the service, has a foot fetish, enjoys being "lower" than the dominant, or any combination. But some bottoms who enjoy servitude prefer to keep their enjoyment and pleasure secret from all others including person(s) they have created as their "dominant".  There are those in the BDSM community who frown upon this practice, however, as surreptitiously putting someone in a dominant position violates the principle of consent.
In other situations, the submissive may also enjoy being collared and leashed, and in some aspects being treated like an animal. Leashes can also be attached to piercings.

Leg shaving is the practice of removing leg hair by shaving the hair off using a razor or electric shaver.  In addition, some people remove leg hair using waxing, sugaring, depilatories, depilation devices, or lasers, but shaving remains the least expensive method.  
It is a very common practice among women in Western countries, and is also done by some men, especially bodybuilders, cyclists, swimmers and some runners.

George Robert "Bob" Newhart (born September 5, 1929) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. Noted for his deadpan and slightly stammering delivery, Newhart came to prominence in the 1960s when his album of comedic monologues The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart was a worldwide bestseller and reached number one on the Billboard pop album chart—it remains the 20th best-selling comedy album in history.Manilla, Ben. "'Button-Down Mind' Changed Modern Comedy", 2007-10-23. The follow-up album, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back! was also a massive success, and the two albums held the Billboard number one and number two spots simultaneously.
Newhart later went into acting, starring in two long-running and prize-winning situation comedies, first as psychologist Dr. Robert "Bob" Hartley on the 1970s sitcom The Bob Newhart Show and then as innkeeper Dick Loudon on the 1980s sitcom Newhart. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the nineties titled Bob and George and Leo. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as Major Major in Catch-22 and Papa Elf in Elf. He provided the voice of Bernard in the Walt Disney animated films The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under. In 2004 he played the library head Judson in The Librarian and again in 2006 and 2008. In 2011, Newhart made a cameo in the film Horrible Bosses, and in 2013 he guest starred in three episodes of The Big Bang Theory, for one of which he won his first Primetime Emmy Award on September 15, 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Bob Newhart finally gets his Emmy Award|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/16/bob-newhart-finally-gets-his-emmy-award/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]

The Mexican Revolution ([tpl]lang-es|Revolución mexicana[/tpl]) or Mexican Civil War ([tpl]lang-es|Guerra civil mexicana[/tpl]) was a major armed struggle that started in 1910, with an uprising led by Francisco I.

After prolonged struggles, its representatives produced the Mexican Constitution of 1917.  The Revolution is generally considered to have lasted until 1920, although the country continued to have sporadic, but comparatively minor, outbreaks of warfare well into the 1920s. The Cristero War of 1926 to 1929 was the most significant relapse into bloodshed.
The Revolution led to the creation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario ("National Revolutionary Party") in 1929; it was renamed the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|''Partido Revolucionario
Institucional'' (Institutional Revolutionary Party)]] (PRI) in 1946.  Under a variety of leaders, the PRI monopolized power until the general election of 2000.

The Spencer Churches (less commonly called the "Union Churches") are the two religious denominations that resulted from a schism in the "Union Church of Africans" (also known as African Union Church), the first independent black denomination, founded by Peter Spencer in Delaware in 1813.
The two denominations created by the schism are the African Union Methodist Protestant Church and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church
It is possible that these churches will reunite.  Various people hope it will be by the Churches' 200th anniversary in 2013.

[[Division (military)]]
CATEGORIES: Military units and formations by size, Divisions (military units)

A division is a large military unit or formation, usually consisting of between 10,000 and 30,000 soldiers. In most armies, a division is composed of several regiments or brigades; in turn, several divisions typically make up a corps. In most modern militaries, a division tends to be the smallest combined arms unit capable of independent operations; this is due to its self-sustaining role as a unit with a range of combat troops and suitable combat support forces, which can be divided into various organic combinations.
While the focus of this article is on army divisions, in naval usage division has a completely different meaning, referring either to an administrative department aboard naval and coast guard ships and shore commands, or to a sub-unit of several ships within a flotilla or squadron. In the administrative usage, unit size varies widely, though typically divisions number far less than 100 people. In the US and Commonwealth Navies a divisional officer (DIVO) is usually an ensign or lieutenant (JG), but may be an officer of much higher rank in certain circumstances or aboard large warships, who oversees a team of enlisted sailors in their duties.

[[Battalion]]

CATEGORIES: Battalions, Military units and formations by size

A battalion is a military unit with 300 to 1,200 soldiers that usually consists of two to seven companies and is commanded by either a lieutenant colonel or a colonel, if in the United States Army or the United States Marine Corps. Several battalions form a regiment or brigade.
The nomenclature varies by nationality and branch of arms, for instance, some armies organize their infantry into battalions, but call battalion-sized cavalry, reconnaissance, or tank units a squadron or a regiment instead. There may even be subtle distinctions within a nation's branches of arms, such as a distinction between a tank battalion and an armored squadron, depending on how the unit's operational role is perceived to fit into the army's historical organization.
A battalion is generally the smallest military organization capable of independent operations (although it must have a source of re-supply to sustain operations for more than several days) because, in addition to comprising sufficient personnel and equipment (usually at least two primary mission companies and one mission support company) to perform significant operations, as well as a limited self-contained administrative and logistics capability, the commander is provided with a full-time staff whose function is to coordinate current operations and plan future operations. A battalion's subordinate units (companies and their organic platoons) are dependent upon the battalion headquarters for command, control, communications, and intelligence and the battalion's organic service and support structure to perform their mission. The battalion is usually part of a regiment, brigade, or group, depending on the organizational model used by that service.
The bulk of a battalion's companies will ordinarily be homogeneous with respect to type (e.g., an infantry battalion or a tank battalion), although there are exceptions.  A battalion includes a headquarters company and some sort of combat service support, typically organized within a combat support company. 
The term is Italian in origin, appearing as battaglione. The French changed the spelling to bataillon, whereupon it directly entered into German.

A company is a military unit, typically consisting of 80–250 soldiers and usually commanded by a captain or a major.

Several companies are grouped to form a battalion or regiment, the latter of which is sometimes formed by several battalions.

Big August Quarterly is an annual religious festival held in Wilmington, Delaware (sometimes called "Big Quarterly" or "August Quarterly").  Begun in 1814 by Peter Spencer in connection with the "quarterly" meeting (or "conference") of the African Union Church -- of the four meetings during the year, the one in August became the "annual conference" of the Church when ministers' assignments for the next year were announced, among other business -- it was a time for free blacks and slaves alike to come together (from the multi-state area) and celebrate their faith with singing, dancing, testifying, and feasting.  It is the oldest such celebration in the country.
Delaware's Senator Joe Biden's remarks on the significance of the "Big Quarterly" were published in the Congressional Record for 30 July 1981 (Vol. 127, No. 117) and for 9 August 1984 (Vol 130, No. 106).

Joseph Robinette "Joe" Biden, Jr.  ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|s|ɨ|f|_|r|ɒ|b|ɨ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|_|ˈ|b|aɪ|d|ən[/tpl]; born November 20, 1942) is the 47th and current Vice President of the United States, jointly elected with President Barack Obama. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was a United States Senator from Delaware from January 3, 1973, until his resignation on January 15, 2009, following his election to the Vice Presidency. In 2012, Biden was elected to a second term alongside Obama.
Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and lived there for ten years before moving to Delaware.  He became an attorney in 1969, and was elected to the New Castle County council in 1970.  Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history.  He was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was the fourth most senior senator at the time of his resignation.  Biden was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.  His strong advocacy helped bring about U.S. military assistance and intervention during the Bosnian War. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991.  He voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002, but later proposed resolutions to alter U.S. strategy there.  He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.
Biden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008, both times dropping out early in the race.  Barack Obama selected Biden to be the Democratic Party nominee for Vice President in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Biden is the first Roman Catholic and the first Delawarean to become Vice President of the United States.  As Vice President, Biden has been heavily involved in Obama's decision-making process and held the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package aimed at counteracting the late-2000s recession.  His ability to negotiate with Congressional Republicans played a key role in bringing about the bipartisan deals that resulted in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 that resolved a taxation deadlock, the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved that year's debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that addressed the impending "fiscal cliff".

In popular usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as "shells". Examples of exoskeleton animals include insects such as grasshoppers and cockroaches, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. The shells of the various groups of shelled mollusks, including those of snails, clams, tusk shells, chitons and nautilus, are also exoskeletons.
Some animals, such as the tortoise, have both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton.

Esto hace más admirable el esfuerzo de don Justo, pues era un miembro destacado —canonizado, dice O'Gorman— del grupo de positivistas mexicanos. Su lucha no fue sólo pedagógica sino también política. Si bien no se puede coincidir con Edmundo O'Gorman respecto al carácter de Sierra como jerarca del positivismo mexicano, pues siempre fue cuestionado por los más ortodoxos como un pensador ecléctico, falto de disciplina, es de compartirse la admiración que profesa a don Justo, pues su lucha por la fundación de la Universidad Nacional implicó serios distanciamientos de sus principales compañeros políticos e intelectuales, ya fueran liberales o positivistas.|format=PDF[/tpl] as a liberal alternative to the Roman Catholic-sponsored Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico (founded on 21 September 1551 by a royal decree of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and brought to a definitive closure in 1867 by the liberals).[tpl]cite web|author = Javier Garciadiego | title = De Justo Sierra a Vasconcelos.

The UNAM generates a number of different publications in diverse areas, such as mathematics, physics and history. It is also the only university in Mexico with Nobel Prize laureates among its alumni: Alfonso García Robles (Peace), Octavio Paz (Literature), and Mario Molina (Chemistry).
Besides being one of the most recognized universities in Latin America, its campus is one of the largest and most artistically detailed. It is a World Heritage site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the 20th century. Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history such as Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The UNAM is widely regarded by many university world rankings as the leading university of the Spanish-speaking world.

Amadis de Gaula (original Old Spanish and Galician-Portuguese spelling) ([tpl]lang-es|Amadís de Gaula[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|amaˈðiz ðe ˈɣaula|IPA[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-pt|Amadis de Gaula[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|ɐmɐˈdiʒ dɨ ˈɡawlɐ|IPA[/tpl]; "Amadis of Gaul") is a landmark work among the knight-errantry tales which were in vogue in 16th century Iberian Peninsula, and formed the earliest reading of many Renaissance and Baroque writers, although it was written at the onset of the 14th century.
The first known printed edition was published in Zaragoza in 1508, by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo (or Garci Ordóñez de Montalvo). It was published in four books in Castilian, but its origins are unclear: The narrative originates in the late post-Arthurian genre and had certainly been read as early as the 14th century by the chancellor Pero López de Ayala as well as his contemporary Pero Ferrús.
Montalvo himself confesses to have amended the first three volumes, and to be the author of the fourth. Additionally, in the Portuguese Chronicle by Gomes Eannes de Azurara (1454), Amadis is attributed to Vasco de Lobeira, who was knighted after the Battle of Aljubarrota (1385). However, although other sources claim that the work was, in fact, a copy of one João de Lobeira, not troubadour Vasco de Lobeira, and that it was a translation into Castilian Spanish of an earlier work, probably from the beginning of the 14th century, no primitive version in the original Portuguese is known. The inspiration for the "Amadis de Gaula" appears to be the blocked marriage of Infanta Constanza of Aragon with Henry of Castile in 1260 (See Juan Manuel's Libro de las Armas of 1335), as blocked was also Oriana's marriage to Amadis. A more recent, minority opinion attributes "Amadis" to Henry of Castile and León, due to evidence linking his biography with the events in "Amadis". Henry of Castile died in 1305.
In his introduction to the text, Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo explains that he has edited the first three books of a text in circulation since the 14th century. Montalvo also admits to adding a fourth as yet unpublished book as well as adding a continuation (Las sergas de Esplandián), which he claims was found in a buried chest in Constantinople and transported to Spain by a Hungarian merchant (the famous motif of the found manuscript).

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic monarchs, Kings of Jerusalem, Kings of Cyprus, Jure uxoris kings, Regents of Jerusalem, Christians of the Third Crusade, 12th-century births, 1194 deaths

Guy of Lusignan (c. 1150 – 18 July 1194) was a Poitevin knight, son of Hugh VIII of the Lusignan dynasty. He was king of the crusader state of Jerusalem from 1186 to 1192 by right of marriage to Sibylla of Jerusalem, and of Cyprus from 1192 to 1194. Having arrived in the Holy Land (where his brother Amalric was already prominent) at an unknown date, Guy was hastily married to Sibylla in 1180 to prevent a political incident within the kingdom. As Baldwin's health deteriorated, Guy was appointed regent of Jerusalem; at Sibylla's succession to the throne in 1186 she gave the crown to Guy as her king-consort. Guy's reign was marked by increased hostilities with the Ayyubids ruled by Saladin, culminating in the disastrous Battle of Hattin in July 1187—during which Guy was captured—and the fall of Jerusalem itself three months later.
Following a year of imprisonment in Damascus, Guy was released by Saladin. After being denied entry to Tyre, one of the last crusader strongholds, by Conrad of Montferrat, Guy besieged Acre in 1189. The siege developed into a rallying point for the Third Crusade, led by Philip Augustus of France and Sibylla's first cousin once-removed, Richard the Lionheart. Guy entered a bitter row with Conrad over the kingship of Jerusalem; despite Richard's support for Guy, Conrad was elected king by the nobility of the kingdom. Conrad was assassinated by the Hashshashin days after the election; Richard's and Guy's involvement in the incident is suspected, but unproven. Nevertheless, Guy was compensated for the dispossession of his crown by being given lordship of Cyprus in 1192, which Richard had annexed from the Byzantine Empire en route to the Levant. Guy ruled the Kingdom of Cyprus until his death in 1194, when he was succeeded by his brother Amalric.

Network Rail is the trade name used by Network Rail Ltd and its various subsidiary companies. The most prominent subsidiary is Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd (previously Railtrack plc) which is the owner and operator of most of the rail infrastructure in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).Network Rail. Retrieved 25 May 2009. It is not responsible for railway infrastructure in Northern Ireland or for the majority of track used by London Underground.
Network Rail Ltd is a statutory corporation created as a "not for dividend" private company limited by guarantee; Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd was reported in the 2010 annual company report as 100%-owned by Network Rail Ltd. Network Rail Ltd. has no shareholders thus is not owned by anyone but it is subject to various official requirements and directions. Currently the company applies its income to its own purposes (including some donations to charities etc.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/5744.aspx |title=For Charities |publisher=Network Rail |accessdate=[/tpl]). The lack of a legal owner makes it liable (as happened with the pre-privatisation Trustee Savings Bank) to any future statute taking it into government ownership and its status as a statutory corporation enables the government to make changes to the company despite not being the legal owner.
Network Rail's main customers are the separate and mostly private-sector train operating companies (TOCs), responsible for passenger transport, and freight operating companies (FOCs), who provide train services on the infrastructure that the company owns and maintains. Network Rail does not itself run passenger or freight services. Ultimately both Network Rail and the train operating companies have the shared responsibility of delivering train services to the travelling public.

[[Women's rights]]

CATEGORIES: Women's rights, Gender studies

Women's rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls of many societies worldwide.
In some places, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others they may be ignored or suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls in favour of men and boys.Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in Human Rights Quarterly, Vol. 3, No. 2. (May, 1981), pp. 1–10.
Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include, though are not limited to, the right: to bodily integrity and autonomy; to vote (suffrage); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; to education; to serve in the military or be conscripted; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital or parental rights.Lockwood, Bert B.

[[Rare earth element]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical element groups, Metallic elements

As defined by IUPAC, a rare earth element (REE) or rare earth metal is one of a set of seventeen chemical elements in the periodic table, specifically the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium.[tpl]cite book |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations 2005 |editor=Edited by N G Connelly and T Damhus (with R M Hartshorn and A T Hutton) |year=2005 |isbn=0-85404-438-8 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |publisher=RSC Publ. |location=Cambridge |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080527204340/http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2012-03-13[/tpl] Scandium and yttrium are considered rare earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties.
Despite their name, rare earth elements (with the exception of the radioactive promethium) are relatively plentiful in the Earth's crust, with cerium being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million (similar to copper). However, because of their geochemical properties, rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated as rare earth minerals in economically exploitable ore deposits.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs087-02/fs087-02.pdf |title=Haxel G, Hedrick J, Orris J. 2006. Rare earth elements critical resources for high technology. Reston (VA): United States Geological Survey. USGS Fact Sheet: 087‐02. |accessdate=2012-03-13[/tpl] It was the very scarcity of these minerals (previously called "earths") that led to the term "rare earth". The first such mineral discovered was gadolinite, a compound of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon and other elements. This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden; several of the rare earth elements bear names derived from this location.

[[Comics]]
CATEGORIES: Comics, Art media, Media formats, Narrative forms

[tpl]not a typo|Comics is[/tpl] a visual medium used to express ideas via images, often combined with text or visual information.  Comics frequently [tpl]not a typo|takes[/tpl] the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images.  Often textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and sound effects ("onomatopoeia") indicate dialogue, narration, or other information.  Elements such as size and arrangement of panels control narrative pacing.  Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images.  Common forms of comics include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.  Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comics albums, and tankōbon have become increasingly common, and online webcomics have proliferated.
The history of comics has followed divergent paths in different cultures.  Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings.  By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the US, western Europe (particularly France and Belgium), and Japan.  European comics traces its history to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the 1920s success of strips such as The Adventures of Tintin.  American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s.  Japanese comics and cartooning ("manga") traces its history to the 13th century.  Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th-century in imitation of Western strips, and by the 1930s comics magazines and book collections became common.  The post-World War II era saw the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka lead to rapid expansion of the popularity of comics in Japan.
[tpl]not a typo|Comics has[/tpl] had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and within academia.  The English term comics derives from the humorous (or comic) work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard also for non-humorous works.  It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as "manga" for Japanese comics, or "bandes dessinées" for French-language comics.  There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.  The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made defining the medium difficult.

The Liberty Bell is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Formerly placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House (now renamed Independence Hall), the bell was commissioned from the London firm of Lester and Pack (today the Whitechapel Bell Foundry) in 1752, and was cast with the lettering (part of Leviticus 25:10) "Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." It originally cracked when first rung after arrival in Philadelphia, and was twice recast by local workmen John Pass and John Stow, whose last names appear on the bell. In its early years, the Liberty Bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens to public meetings and proclamations.
No immediate announcement was made of the Second Continental Congress's vote for independence, and thus the bell could not have rung on July 4, 1776, at least not for any reason related to that vote.  Bells were rung to mark the reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776, and while there is no contemporary account of the Liberty Bell ringing, most historians believe it was one of the bells rung. After American independence was secured, it fell into relative obscurity for some years. In the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies, who dubbed it the "Liberty Bell." It acquired its distinctive large crack sometime in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.
The bell became famous after an 1847 short story claimed that an aged bell-ringer rang it on July 4, 1776, upon hearing of the Second Continental Congress's vote for independence. Despite the fact that the bell did not ring for independence on that July 4, the tale was widely accepted as fact, even by some historians. Beginning in 1885, the City of Philadelphia, which owns the bell, allowed it to go to various expositions and patriotic gatherings. The bell attracted huge crowds wherever it went, additional cracking occurred and pieces were chipped away by souvenir hunters. The last such journey occurred in 1915, after which the city refused further requests.
After World War II, the city allowed the National Park Service to take custody of the bell, while retaining ownership. The bell was used as a symbol of freedom during the Cold War and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on Independence Mall in 1976, and then to the larger Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.

Axel Martin Fredrik Munthe (October 31, 1857 – February 11, 1949) was a Swedish physician and psychiatrist, best known as the author of The Story of San Michele, an autobiographical account of his life and work.
Axel Munthe had a multinational character and spoke several languages (Swedish, English, French, Italian fluently, and German at least passably), growing up in Sweden, attending medical school and opening his first practice in France. He was married to an English aristocrat, and spent most of his adult life in Italy. Munthe had a philanthropic nature, often treating the poor without charge, and risking his life on several occasions to offer medical help in times of war, disaster, or plague. He was a tireless advocate of animal rights, purchasing land to create a bird sanctuary near his home in Italy, advocating bans on painful traps, and keeping pets as diverse as an owl and a baboon, as well as many different types of dog. His writing is light-hearted, being primarily memoirs drawn from his real-life experiences, but often tinged with sadness or tragedy, and often using dramatic license.
He primarily wrote about people and their idiosyncrasies, portraying the foibles of both the rich and the poor, but also about animals.

[[Rayne, Essex]]
CATEGORIES: Villages in Essex, Braintree (district)

Rayne is a village of about 3,000 residents in the Braintree district of Essex in the East of England.
It lies on the Roman road called Stane Street, about two miles (3 km) to the west of Braintree, which is the nearest town.
It used to be a more important settlement than Braintree in Norman times, although this has not been the case for a long time now.
Rayne has a playing field, a pub called The Swan, a village hall that overlooks the playing field, All Saints' church, a war memorial, a stream called Pod's Brook, and a small airfield. There are also the old manor house of Rayne Hall, and Old Hall; a previous Rectory. Rayne Hall was for a long time the home of the Capel family, who became Earls of Essex.  In mediaeval times the Church was known for healing miracles: it was said that infertile women visiting the church were later able to conceive.  A number of the churchyard memorials are made of cast iron: these were manufactured at the former foundry in The Street at around the end of the nineteenth century using a common mound into which individual letters were inserted to spell out the details.History of Rayne Church. Locally published by the PCC of All Saints Church.  1990 Edition.
The church building consists of the Tudor tower, built in 1510, a Nave (an 1840 construction, replacing a Norman building from 1199 and said to be unsafe) and a Sanctuary and Vestry, added in 1914.  The earliest recorded Rector is Ralph de Fremingham, from 1260."All Saints Rayne: A Brief History and Guide to the Church"; Undated but produced during the period 1985-1991.
Further west along the main road ("The Street"), there are an Indian restaurant, another pub, the Welsh Princess, the site of the former Rayne Iron foundry (redeveloped for housing and offices in 2009), the Post Office stores, and what was a pub called The Cock, now renovated and operating as a bar and restaurant called 47 The Street. The road leads to the town of Great Dunmow.
Station Road leads down to the former Rayne railway station, which is now the Rayne Station Centre of the Flitch Way Country Park, a linear park stretching along the former trackbed of the railway. This is also now National Cycle Network route No. 16.
Rayne, which is located about [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] north-east of London, is twinned with Verberie which is about [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] north-east of Paris in the French region of Picardy, which coincidentally is twinned with the County of Essex.
On 12 July 2006, Rayne was named Essex Village of the Year, in a competition organised annually by Rural Community Council of Essex (RCCE) and sponsored by Calor. Rayne also won first, the regional, and then national, Calor Village of the Year Competition 2006/7 in the ITC Category.

[[Blitter]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics processing units

In a computer system, a blitter is a circuit, sometimes as a coprocessor or a logic block on a microprocessor, that is dedicated to the rapid movement and modification of data within that computer's memory. A blitter is capable of copying large quantities of data from one memory area to another relatively quickly, and in parallel with the CPU, whilst freeing up the CPU's more complex ISA for more general operations.
The name comes from BLIT, which is not an acronym[tpl]cite web | url = https://plus.google.com/101960720994009339267/posts/LJU1Aao612X | first = Rob | last = Pike | accessdate = 8 June 2012 | title = 1984 Unix/mpx Exit quiz[/tpl] but is often interpreted as BLock Image Transfer.

[[Bit blit]]

CATEGORIES: Computer graphics algorithms

Bit blit (also written BITBLT, BIT BLT, BitBLT, Bit BLT, Bit Blt etc., which stands for bit-boundary block transfer) is a computer graphics operation in which several bitmaps are combined into one using a raster operator.
The operation involves at least two bitmaps, one source and destination, possibly a third that is often called the "mask" and sometimes a fourth used to create a stencil. The pixels of each are combined bitwise according to the specified raster operation (ROP) and the result is then written to the destination. The ROP is essentially a boolean formula. The most obvious ROP overwrites the destination with the source. Other ROPs may involve AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.[tpl]cite book|last=Sanchez|first=Julio |author2=Maria P. Canton|title=Software solutions for engineers and scientists |publisher=CRC Press|date=2007|pages=690|chapter=Displaying Bit-Mapped images|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=jtKc0k5BWA8C&pg=PA690[/tpl]  The Commodore Amiga's graphics chipset, for example, could combine three source bitmaps according to any of 256 boolean functions of three variables.
Modern graphics software has almost completely replaced bitwise operations with more general mathematical operations used for effects such as alpha compositing. This is because bitwise operations on color displays do not usually produce results that resemble the physical combination of lights or inks. Some software still uses XOR to draw interactive highlight rectangles; when this is done to color images, the unusual resulting colors are easily seen.

The format was originally created by the company Aldus for use in desktop publishing.  The specification originally had the name TIFF as the acronym for "Tagged Image File Format".Versions 4 and 5 of the TIFF specification included the sentence "This memorandum has been prepared jointly by Aldus and Microsoft in conjunction with leading scanner and printer manufacturers"; there was a TIFF co-marketing and developer support effort with Microsoft during this time, though Microsoft was not a technical contributor to the specification. TIFF Revision 5.0[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]  When Adobe Systems acquired Aldus, they published Version 6 (1993) of the TIFF specification which dropped the Microsoft reference as well as all references to TIFF being an acronym. TIFF remains a published specification under the control of Adobe Systems.

[[Encapsulated PostScript]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics file formats, Vector graphics markup languages

Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a DSC-conforming PostScript document with additional restrictions which is intended to be usable as a graphics file format. In other words, EPS files are more-or-less self-contained, reasonably predictable PostScript documents that describe an image or drawing and can be placed within another PostScript document. Simply, an EPS file is a PostScript program, saved as a single file that includes a low-resolution preview "encapsulated" inside of it, allowing some programs to display a preview on the screen.
At minimum, an EPS file contains a BoundingBox DSC comment, describing the rectangle containing the image described by the EPS file. Applications can use this information to lay out the page, even if they are unable to directly render the PostScript inside.
EPS, together with DSC's Open Structuring Conventions, form the basis of early versions of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork file format.

[[EtherType]]
CATEGORIES: Ethernet

EtherType is a two-octet field in an Ethernet frame.  It is used to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload of an Ethernet Frame.  This field was first defined by the Ethernet II framing networking standard, and later adapted for the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet networking standard.
EtherType numbering generally starts from 0x0800.  In modern implementations of Ethernet, the field within the Ethernet frame used to describe the EtherType also can be used to represent the size of the payload of the Ethernet Frame.  Historically, depending on the type of Ethernet framing that was in use on an Ethernet segment, both interpretations were simultaneously valid, leading to ambiguity.  Ethernet v2 framing considered these octets to represent EtherType while the original IEEE 802.3 framing considered these octets to represent the size of the payload in bytes.  In order to allow packets using Ethernet v2 framing and packets using the IEEE 802.3 framing to be used on the same Ethernet segment, a unifying standard (IEEE 802.3x-1997) was introduced that required that EtherType values be greater than or equal to 1536 (0x0600).  That value was chosen because the maximum length (MTU) of the data field of an Ethernet 802.3 frame was 1500 bytes (0x05DC).  Thus, values of 1500 (0x05DC) and below for this field indicate that the field is used as the size of the payload of the Ethernet Frame while values of 1536 and above indicate that the field is used to represent EtherType.  The interpretation of values 1501–1535, inclusive, is undefined.IEEE Std 802.3-2005, 3.2.6  The size of the payload of non-standard jumbo frames, typically ~9000 Bytes long, falls within the range used by EtherType, creating a conflict. The proposition to resolve this conflict was to substitute the special EtherType 0x8870 when a length would otherwise be used.[tpl]cite web |url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kaplan-isis-ext-eth/ |title=Extended Ethernet Frame Size Support |author=Kaplan et al. |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |date=2000-05-26[/tpl]
With 802.1Q VLAN tagging and QinQ the sparse 16-bit EtherType is being completely used. The 16-bit EtherType not only tags the payload class, it also serves to help end any VLAN tagging or QinQ stacking. Via look-ahead peeking in streams, the 16-bit EtherType can help to confirm or package a QinQ 32+32+16=80-bit header between the 48-bit MAC addresses and the payload. Of those 80-bits only 32-bits are used for dynamic information. For a full 66-bit addressing system, 18 bits are needed beyond the MAC. Thus, additional EtherType values are required and used for Triple Tagging QinQinQ. Inefficient and conservative use of a 16-bit Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) on each 32-bit VLAN Tag, followed by the trailing lone 16-bits creates a 48-bit signature that cannot easily be mistaken as part of the payload. Vendor implementations may avoid wasting band-width sending those 48-bits in proprietary link compression schemes. The EtherType usually does not contain any CRC or FCS information.
With the advent of the IEEE 802 suite of standards, a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header combined with an IEEE 802.2 LLC header is used to transmit the EtherType of a payload for IEEE 802 networks other than Ethernet, as well as for non-IEEE networks that use the IEEE 802.2 LLC header, such as FDDI. However, for Ethernet, the Ethernet II header is still used.
Note that even very well known de facto uses of EtherTypes are not always recorded in the IEEE list of EtherType values. For example, EtherType 0x0806 (used by ARP) appears in the IEEE list only as "Symbolics, Inc., Protocol unavailable."

OO gauge or OO scale (also spelled 00 gauge and 00 scale) model railways are the most popular standard-gauge model railway tracks in the United Kingdom. This track gauge is one of several 4 mm-scale standards (4 mm to 1 foot or 1:76.2) used, but it is the only one to be served by the major manufacturers. Despite this, the OO track gauge of [tpl]RailGauge|16.5 mm[/tpl] is inaccurate for 4 mm scale, and other gauges of the same scale have arisen to better serve the desires of some modellers for greater scale accuracy.

Belton House is a Grade I listed country house in Belton near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The mansion is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period.Nicolson, 148. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house;Jackson-Stops. the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes.Jackson-Stops, 56. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.Hussey, 718, 762, and 775.
For three hundred years, Belton House was the seat of the Brownlow and Cust family, who had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary Baroque palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windowsSash windows had first been used on a grand scale at Chatsworth House in the late 1670s but not become popular until installed at Whitehall Palace in 1685, while Belton was under construction. Jackson-Stops, 58. for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from baronets to barons upward to earls and then once again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.
Following World War I (a period when the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a good state of repair and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.

The municipality covers an area of 78 km² (30 mi²), and has a total population of 47,158 (2008). It was formed by the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, and its 1974 adjustment, by merging the parish municipalities of Høje Taastrup, Sengeløse, the Fløng part of Hvedstrup-Fløng and the Reerslev part of Reerslev-Vindinge. The mayor of the municipality is Michael Ziegler, a member of the Conservative People's Party (Det Konservative Folkeparti) political party.
The main town is the town of Taastrup. Other towns in the municipality include Høje Taastrup (without hyphenation), Hedehusene, Fløng, Sengeløse, Vridsløsemagle and Reerslev.
Neighboring municipalities are Albertslund and Vallensbæk to the east, Egedal to the north, Roskilde to the west, and Greve and Ishøj to the south.  The Holbæk Motorway and the West Forest (Vestskoven) help define the municipality's eastern perimeter.
The Holbæk Motorway bisects the municipality east-to-west, and is a major roadway connecting Copenhagen through Roskilde to Holbæk; it extends all the way to the tip of Sjællands Odde, a peninsula sticking out into the Kattegat where a ferry connects to Denmark's mainland (the Jutland peninsula) at the town of Ebeltoft.  Additionally Motorring 4 splits off from the Holbæk Motorway at the municipality's eastern border leading to the various motorways servicing the northern parts of Zealand.  The municipality's good position in the traffic network has led to the development of Høje-Taastrup Transportation Center, which includes Carlsberg Brewery's huge bottle depot.
The West Forest is located where the three municipalities of Høje-Taastrup, Albertslund, and Ledøje-Smørum border on one another.  It is part of a system of green areas surrounding the Copenhagen metropolitan area.  It offers an extensive system of hiking and bike trails through grass and marsh areas.  It connects to other parts of the greenway system, allowing one to seamlessly make a tour around the metropolitan area.
Another throughway in this municipality is historic Roskilde Way (Roskildevej), which runs from Copenhagen to Roskilde.  The first major road connecting these two cities was built in 1642 by King Christian IV.  It was called The King's Road (Kongevejen), and was replaced in the 18th century by the current roadway.  At Hedehusene, one of the towns in the municipality, the road changes name to Copenhagen Way (Københansvej), i.e. the road leading from Roskilde to Copenhagen.  The Holbæk Motorway runs into, and has replaced part of the old Roskilde Way.
Road signs indicating that one is leaving the Copenhagen metropolitan area are mounted within the municipality, where the suburban residential area gives way to the countryside, and the more agricultural side of the municipality.

He was the first mayor of the newly formed Furesø municipality. The community is connected by a road and a motorway and commuter railway to Farum to the north via an isthmus at Fiskebæk between Lake Farum sø and Lake Furesø. The road and motorway run through a small forest on the western shore of Lake Furesø and is almost out of sight and hearing distance from nearby homes in Værløse, but north of the isthmus they run through the town of Farum, separating it in a western and eastern part.
The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Værløse.  Other towns in the former municipality are Hareskovby, Kirke Værløse, and Jonstrup.
Neighboring municipalities were Farum to the north, Stenløse to the west, Ballerup and Herlev to the south, and Gladsaxe, Lyngby-Taarbæk and Søllerød to the east, albeit the last of these is separated physically from the municipality by the waters of Lake Furesø.
On January 1, 2007 Værløse municipality ceased to exist, as the result of Kommunalreformen ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007).  It merged with Farum municipality to form the new Furesø municipality, of which Lake Furesø is the namesake.  This created a municipality with an area of 57 km² and a total population of 37,311 (2005).  The new municipality belongs to Region Hovedstaden ("Copenhagen Capital Region").

The Free French Forces (French: Forces françaises libres) were individuals or military units who joined "Free France" (la France libre), the resistance organisation founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1940 in London to continue the struggle against the Axis powers.
De Gaulle, a French government minister who rejected the armistice concluded by Marshal Philippe Pétain and who had escaped to Britain, exhorted the French to resist in his BBC broadcast "Appeal of 18 June" (Appel du 18 juin), which had a stirring effect on morale throughout France and its colonies, although initially relatively few French forces responded to de Gaulle's call.
The Free French fought Axis and Vichy troops and served on battlefronts everywhere from the Middle East to Indochina and North Africa. The Free French Navy operated as an auxiliary force to the Royal Navy, and there were Free French units in the Royal Air Force, Soviet Air Force, and British SAS.
In November 1942, the Allies invaded Vichy-controlled French North Africa, and many Vichy troops joined the Free French, with General Henri Giraud at their head. This caused the Germans to occupy Vichy France, and in retaliation a Vichy force of 60,000 in North Africa joined the Allies.
On 1 August 1943, the Free French were formally united with the Armée d'Afrique to form the Armée française de la Liberation. By mid-1944, the forces of this army numbered more than 400,000, and they participated in the Normandy landings and the invasion of Southern France, eventually leading the drive on Paris. Soon they were fighting in Alsace, the Alps and Brittany, and by the end of the war in Europe, they were 1,300,000 strong  –  the fourth-largest Allied army in Europe – and took part in the Allied invasion of Germany.

[[Soju]]

CATEGORIES: Rice drinks, Korean distilled beverages, Distilled beverages

Soju  (Hangul 소주; Hanja 燒酒) is a distilled beverage native to Korea. Jinro and Lotte soju are the first and third top selling alcohol brands in the world.http://www.indiatimes.com/food/worlds-best-selling-alcohol-27740.html It is usually consumed neat.
Most brands of soju are made in South Korea. It is traditionally made from rice, wheat, or barley, but modern producers of soju use supplements or even replace rice with other starches, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, or tapioca.
Soju is clear and colorless. Its alcohol content varies from about 16.7%, to about 45% alcohol by volume (ABV) for traditional Andong soju,http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?currentPage=2&fboardId=1064 with 20% ABV being most common. However, by using freeze distillation, ABV can be increased to desired percentage. There are two different ways to produce soju; the classic way of distilling soju that uses the single distillation method and the modern way of diluted soju that uses the chain distillation method.http://www1.american.edu/TED/soju.htm Distilled soju usually has a higher ABV of 30~35% than diluted soju with ABV of 21~30%. As distilled soju tends to have a higher ABV, it has stronger smell than diluted soju. It is widely consumed in part because of its relatively low price in Korea. A typical 375mL bottle of soju costs the consumer 1,000 to 3,000 South Korean won in South Korea (roughly $1 to $3 Canadian dollars). In Canada, it costs substantially more – $5.50 ~ $9.25 (depends on brand) http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=soju&ITEM_NUMBER= as tariffs and excise taxes add onto its original cost price.
Now soju is exported to 80 countries and is in the top market share of diluted alcohol market. 
Statistically, soju ranked #1 in world sale records of the diluted alcohol market in 2002.

[[Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend]]

CATEGORIES: Arthurian locations

The following is a list and assessment of sites and places associated with King Arthur and the Arthurian legend in general. Given the lack of concrete historical knowledge about one of the most potent figures in British mythology, it is unlikely that any definitive conclusions about the claims for these places will ever be established; nevertheless it is both interesting and important to try to evaluate the body of evidence which does exist and examine it critically. The earliest reference to Arthur is in Aneirin's poem Y Gododdin (c. 594). While his fame may have increased in the intervening years, the facts about his life have become less discernible.
The earliest association with Arthur of many of the places listed is often surprisingly recent, with most southern sites' association based on nothing more than the toponymic speculations of recent authors with a local prejudice to promote.

[[Aldus]]
CATEGORIES: Defunct software companies of the United States, Companies established in 1985, Companies disestablished in 1994, Defunct companies based in Seattle, Washington

Aldus Corporation was a software company that developed desktop publishing software. It is known for developing PageMaker, an early product in the desktop publishing field. The company is named after 15th-century Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, and was founded by Jeremy Jaech, Mark Sundstrom, Mike Templeman, Dave Walter, and chairman Paul Brainerd.[ref]
</ref>  Aldus Corporation was based in [[Seattle, Washington]].
PageMaker was released in July 1985, and relied on Adobe's PostScript page description language. For output, it used the Apple LaserWriter, a PostScript laser printer. PageMaker for the PC was released in 1986, but by then the Mac was already the de facto DTP platform, with Adobe Illustrator (released in 1987) and Adobe Photoshop (released in 1990) completing the suite of graphic design software.
Aldus went on to offer its Illustrator-like program, FreeHand, licensed from Altsys (who also developed Fontographer). FreeHand and Illustrator competed with each other for years, through multiple releases. This rivalry continued even after the Aldus acquisition, because FreeHand was not included, but Adobe eventually acquired Freehand in 2005 with its acquisition of then-owner Macromedia. Although still being sold by Adobe, FreeHand MX is no longer supported or updated.[tpl]cite web|title=Adobe - FreeHand MX - buy or upgrade|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/freehand/[/tpl]
In early 1990, Aldus bought Silicon Beach Software, acquiring a number of consumer titles for the Macintosh, including SuperPaint, Digital Darkroom, SuperCard, Super3D, and Personal Press (later renamed Adobe Home Publisher).  Silicon Beach was located in San Diego, California, and became the Aldus Consumer Division.
In 1993, Aldus bought After Hours Software and incorporated its products, TouchBase Pro and DateBook Pro, into the Aldus Consumer Division.
During the 1990s, QuarkXPress steadily won ground from PageMaker, and it seemed increasingly odd that Adobe — who had created PostScript, so vital to the working of DTP — still did not offer its own page layout application. This was resolved in September 1994 when Aldus merged with Adobe. Today, Adobe's competition to QuarkXPress is Adobe InDesign. PageMaker remains available but is no longer marketed; existing PageMaker customers are now urged to switch to InDesign.
Aldus developed the TIFF and OPI industry standards.  The three founders of Visio Corporation left Aldus in 1990 to create the product that later became known as Microsoft Office Visio.

Barry William Zito (born May 13, 1978) is an American professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball who is currently a free agent. He stands [tpl]convert|6|ft|2|in|m[/tpl] tall and weighs [tpl]convert|205|lb|kg[/tpl]. He previously played for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. He bats and throws left-handed. His pitching repertoire consists of a curveball (his strikeout pitch), a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a circle changeup, and a cutter-slider.
Zito was drafted three times during college and attended three colleges: UC Santa Barbara, Los Angeles Pierce College, and the University of Southern California. When he was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round in 1999, he chose to sign. A year later, he was in the major leagues, finishing fifth in American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award. He struggled to begin the 2001 season but improved greatly down the stretch, finishing the year 11–1 over his final two months.  He won 23 games (while only losing five) in 2002 and won the Cy Young Award. His record was only 14–12 in 2003, but he still made the All-Star team for the second year in a row. In 2004, he had his worst season at the time, going 11–11 with a career-high 4.48 earned run average. He became Oakland's Opening Day starter in 2005 and finished fifth in the AL with 171 strikeouts. In 2006, he made the All-Star team and posted a 15–1 record when receiving two or more runs of support.
Following his seventh season with the Athletics, Zito signed a seven-year deal with the San Francisco Giants in December, 2006. He posted double-digit wins in his first three seasons, and in 2010 he helped San Francisco win their first championship since 1954. However, he struggled the last month of the season and he was left off the postseason roster. After sitting out much of the 2011 season with a foot and ankle injury, he came back in 2012 and flourished, finishing with a 15–8 record, his best season in a Giants uniform. The same October, Zito helped lead the Giants to their second World Series title in San Francisco history by going 2–0 with a 1.69 ERA in three postseason starts. In his first career World Series start, he outdueled Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1, setting the stage for San Francisco's sweep to their seventh World Series title in franchise history. Zito struggled in 2013 but received a standing ovation from the fans in his final appearance as a Giant. Following the year, he became a free agent. Zito, a philanthropist, founded Strikeouts For Troops, a national non-profit that provides comforts of home and lifts the spirits and morale of injured troops as well as offering support to military families.

The racial policy of Nazi Germany was a set of policies and laws implemented by Nazi Germany, asserting the superiority of the "Aryan race", and based on a specific racist doctrine which claimed scientific legitimacy. It was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene by using compulsory sterilizations and extermination of the Untermenschen (or "sub-humans"), and which eventually culminated in the Holocaust. These policies targeted peoples, in particular Jews, as well as Gypsies, homosexuals and handicapped people, ethnic Poles,Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics against Human Dignity, by André Mineau, (Rodopi, 2004) page 180  Russians who were labeled as "inferior" in a racial hierarchy that placed the Herrenvolk (or "master race") of the Volksgemeinschaft (or "national community") at the top, and ranked Russians, Romani, Serbs, Poles, persons of color and Jews at the bottom.The Czechs under Nazi rule: the failure of national resistance, 1939-1942, Vojtěch Mastný, Columbia University Press [tpl]Page needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]The making of the slavs: history and archaeology of the Lower Danube Region, (Cambridge University Press, 2001) page 9, 26-30 By Florin CurtaJerry Bergman, "Eugenics and the Development of Nazi Race Policy", Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith PSCF 44 (June 1992):109-124Götz Aly, Peter Chroust, Christian Pross, Cleansing the fatherland: Nazi medicine and racial hygiene, The Johns Hopkins University Press, (August 1, 1994 :) ISBN 0-8018-4824-5

A corset is a garment worn to hold and shape the torso into a desired shape for aesthetic or medical purposes (either for the duration of wearing this item, or with a more lasting effect). Both men and women are known to wear corsets, though women are more common wearers.
In recent years, the term "corset" has also been borrowed by the fashion industry to refer to tops which, to varying degrees, mimic the look of traditional corsets without actually acting as one. While these modern corsets and corset tops often feature lacing or boning and generally mimic a historical style of corsets, they have very little if any effect on the shape of the wearer's body. Genuine corsets are usually made by a corsetmaker and should be fitted to the individual wearer.

[[Prophase]]

CATEGORIES: Mitosis

Prophase, from the ancient Greek πρό (before) and φάσις (stage), is a stage of mitosis in which the chromatin  condenses into double rod-shaped structures called chromosomes in which the chromatin becomes visible.  This process, called chromatin condensation, is involved with the condensin complex. Since the genetic material has been replicated in the prior interphase of the cell cycle, there are two identical copies of each chromosome in the cell. Those copies are called sister chromatids and they are attached to each other at a DNA element present on every chromosome called the centromere. Also during prophase, giemsa staining can be applied to elicit G-banding in chromosomes.
An important organelle in mitosis is the centrosome, the microtubule organizing center in metazoans. During prophase, the two centrosomes, which replicate independently of mitosis, have their microtubule-activity increased due to the recruitment of γ-tubulin. The centrosomes will be pushed apart to opposite ends of the cell nucleus by the action of molecular motors acting on the microtubules.
Basically, the chromatin in the nucleus coils into chromosomes. The nucleolus disintegrates and the centrosomes move to opposite poles of the cell, forming a bridge of spindle fibers.
In prometaphase, the next step of mitosis, the nuclear membrane breaks apart and the chromosomes are captured by the microtubules.

In mathematics, a quadric, or quadric surface, is any D-dimensional hypersurface in (D + 1)-dimensional space defined as  the locus of zeros of a quadratic polynomial. In coordinates [tpl]nowrap|{x1, x2, ..., xD+1[/tpl]}, the general quadric is defined by the algebraic equationSilvio Levy Quadrics in "Geometry Formulas and Facts", excerpted from 30th Edition of CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulas, CRC Press, from The Geometry Center at University of Minnesota
which may be compactly written in vector and matrix notation as:
where x = [tpl]nowrap|{x1, x2, ..., xD+1[/tpl]} is a row vector, xT is the transpose of x (a column vector), Q is a (D + 1)×(D + 1) matrix and P is a (D + 1)-dimensional row vector and R a scalar constant.  The values Q, P and R are often taken to be real numbers or complex numbers, but in fact, a quadric may be defined over any ring.  In general, the locus of zeros of a set of polynomials is known as an algebraic variety, and is studied in the branch of algebraic geometry.
A quadric is thus an example of an algebraic variety. For the projective theory see quadric (projective geometry).

DEF CON (also written as DEFCON or Defcon) is one of the world's largest annual hacker conventions, held every year in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first DEF CON took place in June 1993.
Many of the attendees at DEF CON include computer security professionals, journalists, lawyers, federal government employees, security researchers, and hackers with a general interest in software, computer architecture, phone phreaking, hardware modification, and anything else that can be "cracked." The event consists of several tracks of speakers about computer- and cracking-related subjects, as well as social events and contests in everything from creating the longest Wi-Fi connection and cracking computer systems to who can most effectively cool a beer in the Nevada heat.  Other contests include lockpicking, robotics-related contests (discontinued), art, slogan, coffee wars (not currently running), scavenger hunt and Capture the Flag. Capture the Flag (CTF) is perhaps the best known of these contests. It is a hacking competition where teams of crackers attempt to attack and defend computers and networks using certain software and network structures. CTF has been emulated at other cracking conferences as well as in academic and military contexts.
Conference  founder Jeff Moss contends that the quality of submitted talks has diminished since DEF CON's inception because security researchers have found companies and government agencies to pay for the research, leaving the researchers less willing to unveil their zero day vulnerability research "for free" at DEF CON.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1157|title=The Vulnerability Economy|accessdate=2008-08-27|author=HNS|work=Help Net Security[/tpl]  Additionally, the conference has gone from one track to five and accepting speaker proposals for five times the research lowers the density of "elite" speeches.
Since DEF CON 11, fundraisers have been conducted for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  The first fundraiser was a dunk tank and was an "official" event. The EFF now has an event named "The Summit" hosted by the Vegas 2.0 crew that is an open event and fundraiser. DefCon 18 (2010) hosted a new fundraiser called MohawkCon. In 2010, over 10,000 people attended DEF CON 18.
Federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, DoD, United States Postal Inspection Service, and other agencies regularly attend DEF CON.
DEF CON was also portrayed in the The X-Files episode "Three of a Kind" featuring an appearance by The Lone Gunmen.  DEF CON was portrayed as a United States government sponsored convention instead of a civilian convention.

[[Fibronectin]]

CATEGORIES: Integrins

Fibronectin is a high-molecular weight (~440kDa) glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix that binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins called integrins.[tpl]cite journal | author = Pankov R, Yamada KM | title = Fibronectin at a glance | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 115 | issue = Pt 20 | pages = 3861–3 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12244123 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00059  | url =   [/tpl]  Similar to integrins, fibronectin binds extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibrin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (e.g. syndecans).
Fibronectin exists as a protein dimer, consisting of two nearly identical monomers linked by a pair of disulfide bonds. The fibronectin protein is produced from a single gene, but alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA leads to the creation of several isoforms.
Two types of fibronectin are present in vertebrates:
Fibronectin plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation, and it is important for processes such as wound healing and embryonic development.  Altered fibronectin expression, degradation, and organization has been associated with a number of pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis.[tpl]cite journal | author = Williams CM, Engler AJ, Slone RD, Galante LL, Schwarzbauer JE | title = Fibronectin expression modulates mammary epithelial cell proliferation during acinar differentiation | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 3185–92 |date=May 2008 | pmid = 18451144 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2673 | url = | pmc = 2748963  [/tpl]

[[SOS]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency communication, Encodings, Morse code, Rescue, Survival skills, Distress signals, Brevity codes

SOS is the commonly used description for the international Morse code distress signal  (· · · – – – · · ·). This distress signal was first adopted by the German government in radio regulations effective April 1, 1905, and became the worldwide standard under the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention, which was signed on November 3, 1906 and became effective on July 1, 1908. SOS remained the maritime radio distress signal until 1999, when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress Safety System.[tpl] cite web|url = http://www.imo.org/includes/blastData.asp/doc_id=1196/GMDSS%20(13%20April%202005).doc|accessdate = 2008-07-02|title = GMDSS Resolution COM/Circ.115 "Discontinuation of morse code services in the MF radiotelegraphy band" 10.02.93|work = GMDSS[/tpl] SOS is still recognized as a visual distress signal.US Coast Guard Visual Distress Signals 
The SOS distress signal is a continuous sequence of three dits, three dahs, and three dits, all run together without letter spacing. In International Morse Code, three dits form the letter S, and three dahs make the letter O, so "SOS" became an easy way to remember the order of the dits and dahs. In modern terminology, SOS is a Morse "procedural signal" or "prosign", and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters: SOS. 
In popular usage, SOS became associated with such phrases as "save our ship", "save our souls" and "send out succour". These may be regarded as mnemonics, but SOS does not actually stand for anything and is not an abbreviation, acronym or initialism. In fact, SOS is only one of several ways that the combination could have been written; VTB, for example, would produce exactly the same sound, but SOS was chosen to describe this combination. SOS is the only 9-element signal in Morse code, making it more easily recognisable, as no other symbol uses more than 8 elements.

The River Tyne [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Tyne.ogg|'|t|aɪ|n[/tpl] is a river in North East England and its length excluding tributaries is 200 miles. It is formed by the confluence of two rivers: the North Tyne and the South Tyne. These two rivers converge at Warden Rock near Hexham in Northumberland at a place dubbed 'The Meeting of the Waters'.
The North Tyne rises on the Scottish border, north of Kielder Water. It flows through Kielder Forest, and passes through the village of Bellingham before reaching Hexham.
The South Tyne rises on Alston Moor, Cumbria and flows through the towns of Haltwhistle and Haydon Bridge, in a valley often called the Tyne Gap. Hadrian's Wall lies to the north of the Tyne Gap. Coincidentally the source of the South Tyne is very close to the sources of the other two great rivers of the industrial north east namely the Tees and the Wear. The South Tyne Valley falls within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) - the second largest of the 40 AONBs in England and Wales.
The combined Tyne flows from Hexham, the area where the river's now thriving barbel stocks were first introduced in the mid-1980s, through Corbridge in Northumberland. It enters the county of Tyne and Wear between Clara Vale (in the Borough of Gateshead on the south bank) and Tyne Riverside Country Park (in Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank) and continues to divide Newcastle and Gateshead for [tpl]convert|13|mi|0[/tpl], in the course of which it is spanned by 10 bridges. To the east of Gateshead and Newcastle, the Tyne divides Hebburn and Jarrow on the south bank from Walker and Wallsend on the north bank. Jarrow and Wallsend are linked underneath the river by the Tyne Tunnel. Finally it flows between South Shields and Tynemouth into the North Sea.

[[Barad-dûr]]

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth castles and fortresses

Barad-dûr (Sindarin "Dark Tower", sometimes given as The Barad-dûr (Lugbúrz in Black Speech)) is the fictional fortress of Sauron in the heart of the black land of Mordor and close to Mount Doom in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The Eye of Sauron kept watch over Middle-earth from its highest tower.
Barad-dûr was built by Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor, with the power of the One Ring, during the Second Age. The building took six hundred years to complete; it was the greatest fortress ever built since the Fall of Angband, and much of Sauron's personal power went into it.
Barad-dûr was besieged for seven years by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and was levelled after Sauron's defeat at the end of the Second Age, but because it was created using the power of the One Ring, its foundations could not be destroyed completely unless the Ring itself was destroyed. Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron's hand but refused to destroy it, so the Tower was quickly rebuilt when Sauron returned to Mordor thousands of years later, in T.A. 2951.
The Dark Tower was described as existing on a massive scale so large it was almost surreal, although Tolkien does not provide much detail beyond its size and immense strength. Since it had a "topmost tower" it presumably had multiple towers. It is otherwise described as dark and surrounded in shadow, so that it could not be clearly seen.
In his vision at Amon Hen, Frodo Baggins perceived the immense tower as "wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant...Barad-dûr, Fortress of Sauron".
There was an "immeasurably high" look-out post, "the Window of the Eye in Sauron’s shadow-mantled fortress", said to face Mount Doom. In this window, Frodo and Sam had a terrible glimpse of the Eye of Sauron.
There is a drawing by Tolkien that he titled "Barad-dûr"; since he did not publish it during his lifetime, it is unclear how close the drawing is to his mature vision of the tower. The picture shows only the left edge of the lower part of a structure that seems to be constructed of immense masonry blocks of some greenish-grey stone. The few existing windows are small and either dark or lighted dark red; one is clearly barred. One high, thin vertical spire is visible in the background. The whole building seems to stand on top of a large monolithic rock with almost vertical edges and a relatively flat top. A narrow stone bridge leads across the chasm to the single visible door, through which flames can be seen inside the tower. An erupting volcano (presumably Mount Doom) can be seen in the background, a lava stream flowing from there past the side of the monolithic rock.

[[Crack of doom]]

CATEGORIES: English phrases

The Crack of Doom is an old term used for the Christian Day of Judgement, referring in particular to the blast of trumpets signalling the end of the world in Chapter 8 of the Book of Revelation.  A "crack" had the sense of any loud noise, preserved in the phrase "crack of thunder",OED, "Crack" and Doom was a term for the Last Judgement, as Doomsday still is.
The phrase is famously used in the Day of Judgement sense by William Shakespeare in Macbeth, where on the heath the Three Witches show Macbeth the line of kings that will issue from Banquo: 
(Act 4, scene 1, 112–117)- meaning that Banquo's line will endure until the Judgement Day, flattery for King James I, who claimed descent from Banquo. 
In J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world of Middle-earth, the Professor of Old English  plays upon the phrase to provide the literal Crack(s) of Doom, physical cracks — fissures within the great volcano of Orodruin, also known as Mount Doom.
In the Time Tunnel television show episode entitled "The Crack of Doom," Tony and Doug try to convince scientists studying the volcano Krakatoa, that it is about to erupt cataclysmically.
In the Alfred Hitchcock Presents television series episode titled, "Crack of Doom," a poker player finds himself digging deeper and deeper towards ruin. 
"Crack of Doom" is the English title of a currently out-of-print novel by German author Willi Heinrich, which is set in the Second World War.  It is about German troops fighting partisans and Soviet forces in Eastern Europe during the closing stages of the war.
"Crack of Doom" is also the title of Tiger Lillies hit from Bad Blood and Blasphemy album.
"At The Crack Of Doom" is a song by Warbringer from the album "War Without End."  It features the lyrics, "Satan claims his throne at the crack of doom."

[[Celebrimbor]]

CATEGORIES: Characters in The Silmarillion, Fictional characters introduced in 1977, Fictional smiths, High Elves, Middle-earth rulers, Noldor

Celebrimbor ([tpl]IPA-art|ˌkeleˈbrimbor[/tpl]) is a fictional character In J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. His name means "silver fist" or "Hand of silver" in Sindarin (Telperinquar in Quenya, Telperimpar in Telerin).
Celebrimbor was the son of Curufin, fifth son of Fëanor (son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel) and Nerdanel, and the only known grandchild of Fëanor. It is not known where or when Celebrimbor was born. Since Celebrimbor was not mentioned as being present during the Oath of Fëanor, and is first mentioned as living in Nargothrond, it is likely that he was born after the exile of the Noldor, in Middle-earth. 
Little is said of his deeds during the First Age. He probably fled to Nargothrond after the Dagor Bragollach. However, he took no part in the deeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He even repudiated his father and uncle's deeds and did not follow them when the two brothers were expelled from Nargothrond. Celebrimbor survived the First Age, but probably was forced due to the Doom of Mandos — or perhaps freely elected — to remain in Middle-earth rather than return to Valinor.
In Tolkien's stories, Celebrimbor plays an important role as the maker of the Rings of Power. During the Second Age, he lived in the Elvish realm of Eregion and founded a brotherhood of jewelsmiths, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain (lit, "People of the Jewel Smiths"). Under the seemingly benevolent guidance and instruction of the unexpected Vanya visitor "Annatar", the "Lord of Gifts", of the fairest race of elves, who claimed he had been sent by the Valar to share his wisdom and skills in ring and jewel making for the benefit of all Middle-earth but who was in fact the Dark Lord Sauron in fair disguise, Celebrimbor led the smiths of Eregion into making sixteen Great rings for the peoples of Middle-earth—seven to the Dwarven lords and nine to Men. But secretly, without Sauron's knowledge, Celebrimbor also forged Three Rings for the Elves, the greatest and fairest of the Rings of Power. These rings were thus free of Sauron's corrupting influence. Celebrimbor named the rings Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire, and water, respectively.
At this same time, Sauron was secretly forging the One Ring which would enable him to rule Middle-earth. Sauron reassumed his role as the Dark Lord and placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their bearers. Before this, Celebrimbor had believed Sauron to be what he had claimed to be, but realising the truth he and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. He had already sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon, and Nenya to Galadriel in Lothlórien, but Sauron underestimated their spiritual strength and they became aware of his attempt to mentally enthrall them through their rings and ceased to wear them. With his scheme exposed to at least the elves, Sauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, initiating the War of the Elves and Sauron and laying waste to the realm. Celebrimbor was captured in the sack, and was forced under torture to disclose where the Nine and the Seven were held, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three Elvish rings. Sauron captured the lesser rings and used them as instruments of evil in later years, particularly against Men. Celebrimbor died from his torment, the last direct descendant of the line of Fëanor.

[[Centralizer and normalizer]]
CATEGORIES: Abstract algebra, Group theory, Ring theory, Lie algebras

In mathematics, especially group theory, the centralizer of a subset S of a group G is the set of elements of G that commute with each element of S, and the normalizer of S is the set of elements of G that commute with S "as a whole". The centralizer and normalizer of S are subgroups of G, and can provide insight into the structure of G.
The definitions also apply to monoids and semigroups.
In ring theory, the centralizer of a subset of a ring is defined with respect to the semigroup (multiplication) operation of the ring. The centralizer of a subset of a ring R is a subring of R. This article also deals with centralizers and normalizers in Lie algebra.
The idealizer in a semigroup or ring is another construction that is in the same vein as the centralizer and normalizer.

The building opened for initial occupancy on March 16, 2004. It sits on the site of MIT's former Building 20, which housed the historic Radiation Laboratory, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Major funding for the project was provided by Ray Stata (MIT class of 1957) and Maria Stata. Other major funders include Bill Gates, Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. (MIT class of 1954), Charles Thomas "E.B" Pritchard Hintze (an MIT graduate, and of JD Edwards, now Oracle Corporation) and Morris Chang of TSMC. Above the fourth floor, the building splits into two distinct structures: the Gates tower and the Dreyfoos tower.
Contained within the building are the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, as well as the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. Academic celebrities such as Noam Chomsky and Ron Rivest have offices there. World Wide Web Consortium founder Tim Berners-Lee and free software movement founder Richard Stallman also have offices within.
Several MIT classes, including many taught by the computer science and electrical engineering department (Course VI), are held inside. The Forbes Family Café is also located in the Stata Center, serving coffee and lunch to the public.
In contrast to the trend at MIT of referring to buildings by their numbers rather than their official names, the complex is usually referred to as "Stata", or "the Stata Center". The two towers are often called "G Tower" and "D tower".

The Manx cat ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|ŋ|k|s[/tpl]; Manx language: [tpl]lang|gv|kayt Manninagh[/tpl]), in earlier times often spelled Manks, is a breed of domestic cat (Felis catus) originating on the Isle of Man, with a naturally occurring mutation that shortens the tail. Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited. Long-haired variants are sometimes considered a separate breed, the Cymric. Manx are prized as skilled hunters, and thus have often been sought by farmers with rodent problems, and been a preferred ship's cat breed. They are said to be social, tame and active. An old local term for the cats on their home island is stubbin. Manx have been exhibited in cat shows since the 1800s, with the first known breed standard published in 1903.

Some cat registries consider the Cymric simply a semi-long-haired variety of the Manx breed, rather than a separate breed. Except for the length of fur, in all other respects the two varieties are the same, and kittens of either sort may appear in the same litter.  The name comes from Cymru ([tpl]IPA-cy|ˈkəmrɨ[/tpl]), the indigenous Welsh name of Wales, though the breed is not associated with Wales, and the name was possibly given as an attempt to provide a "Celtic"-sounding name for the breed.  The breed's Manx bloodline originated in the Isle of Man, though Canada claims to have developed the long-haired variant. The breed is called the Longhair Manx or a similar name by some registries.

[[Autobiographical novel]]
CATEGORIES: Literary genres, Autobiographies, Works about writers

An autobiographical novel is a form of novel using autofiction techniques, or the merging of autobiographical and fiction elements. The literary technique is distinguished from an autobiography or memoir by the stipulation of being fiction. Because an autobiographical novel is partially fiction, the author does not ask the reader to expect the text to fulfill the "autobiographical pact." Philippe Lejeune, "Autobiographical Pact," pg. 19 Names and locations are often changed and events are recreated to make them more dramatic but the story still bears a close resemblance to that of the author's life.  While the events of the author's life are recounted, there is no pretense of exact truth. Events may be exaggerated or altered for artistic or thematic purposes.
Novels that portray settings and/or situations with which the author is familiar are not necessarily autobiographical. Neither are novels that include aspects drawn from the author’s life as minor plot details. To be considered an autobiographical novel by most standards, there must be a protagonist modeled after the author and a central plotline that mirrors events in his or her life. 
Novels that do not fully meet these requirements or are further distanced from true events are sometimes called semi-autobiographical novels.  
Many novels about intense, private experiences such as war, family conflict or sex, are written as autobiographical novels. 
Some works openly refer to themselves as 'nonfiction novels.' The definition of such works remains vague. The term was first widely used in reference to the non-autobiographical In Cold Blood by Truman Capote but has since become associated with a range of works drawing openly from autobiography. The emphasis is on the creation of a work that is essentially true, often in the context of an investigation into values or some other aspect of reality. The books Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig and The Tao of Muhammad Ali by Davis Miller open with statements admitting to some fictionalising of events but state they are true 'in essence.'

The Scottish Fold is a breed of cat with a natural dominant-gene mutation that makes its ear cartilage contain a fold, causing the ears to bend forward and down towards the front of their head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfa.org/Client/scottish.aspx |title=Breed article: Scottish Folds |publisher=Cat Fanciers' Association| author=Grace Sutton |date=1999-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-29[/tpl]

[[Ring En Español]]

CATEGORIES: Boxing magazines, Publications established in 1977, Publications disestablished in 1985, The Ring (magazine)

The Ring En Español was a Spanish version of boxing publication The Ring magazine. Ring En Español was published from 1977 to 1985. Originally published from Caracas, it moved in 1981 to Miami, to Editorial America (currently owned by Televisa), the same editorial house that oversaw the production of Cosmopolitan's Spanish version.
Although Ring En Español covered every boxing event worldwide, it concentrated more than anything else on Hispanic boxers, helping boxers like Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, Julio César Chávez, Eusebio Pedroza, Roberto Durán, Santos Laciar, Antonio Cervantes, Pipino Cuevas, Ossie Ocasio, Lupe Pintor, Rafael "Bazooka" Limón, Edwin Rosario, Héctor Camacho and many others become household names.
The unstable Latin American economy combined with rising magazine production costs and other factors caused The Ring En Español to come off the newsstands after the October 1985 edition. Lupe Pintor was featured on the magazine's last cover, having won the WBC Super Featherweight championship of the world by defeating Juan Meza the previous August in Aguascalientes, Mexico.
The Ring en Español's top competitor was Guantes.

CATEGORIES: Depressions (geology), Oceanic trenches, Plate tectonics, Coastal and oceanic landforms

The oceanic trenches are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They are also the deepest parts of the ocean floor. Oceanic trenches are a distinctive morphological feature of convergent plate boundaries. 
Along convergent plate boundaries, plates move together at rates that vary from a few mm to over ten cm per year. A trench marks the position at which the flexed, subducting  slab begins to descend beneath another lithospheric slab.  Trenches are generally parallel to a volcanic island arc, and about [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from a volcanic arc. Oceanic trenches typically extend [tpl]convert|3|to|4|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] below the level of the surrounding oceanic floor. The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of

[[Seafloor spreading]]
CATEGORIES: Geological processes, Plate tectonics

Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. Basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new sea floor. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone.
Earlier theories (e.g. by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit) of continental drift were that continents "ploughed" through the sea. The idea that the seafloor itself moves (and carries the continents with it) as it expands from a central axis was proposed by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s.[tpl]Cite book |first=H.

A mantle ([tpl]lang-el|μανδύας, mandyas[/tpl]; Church Slavonic: мантия, mantiya) is an ecclesiastical garment in the form of a very full cape that extends to the floor, joined at the neck, that is worn over the outer garments. 
In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic churches, the mantle  is a monastic garment worn by bishops, hegumens, archimandrites, and other monastics in processions and while attending various church services, such as Vespers or Matins; but not when vested to celebrate the Divine Liturgy.

[[Gondwana, India]]

CATEGORIES: Regions of India, Regions of Madhya Pradesh, Geography of Odisha, Proposed states and territories of India, Regions of Maharashtra

Gondwana is a region of India. Named after the Gondi people who live there (though they can also be found in other parts of India), the name of the ancient continent of Gondwanaland was derived from Gondwana, because some of the earliest rock formations of this continent were first investigated in part of the region, in modern Odisha.
As Gonds are spread widely across central India, and are a minority almost everywhere, there is no unambiguous boundary to the region. However, the core region can be considered to be the eastern part of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, the parts of Madhya Pradesh immediately to the north of it, and parts of the west of Chhattisgarh. The wider region extends beyond these, also including parts of northern Andhra Pradesh, western Odisha and Uttar Pradesh.
The region is part of the northern Deccan plateau, with an average height of about 600–700 metres. Much of it is rugged and hilly. Geologically it is mostly Pre-Cambrian rock, with some areas dated to Permian and Triassic periods. Part of it is overlaid with alluvium, and in the west it is overlaid with the igneous rocks of the Deccan Traps. 
The climate is hot and semi-arid. The natural vegetation is dry monsoon forest, or monsoon scrub forest. Large parts of it are still forest, and it contains several national parks, including tiger populations. 
Gondwana has a relatively high proportion of  peoples of the "scheduled tribes" of India, which include the Gonds. The scheduled tribes are recognised as economically and socially disadvantaged. They form a majority of the population in many districts.

Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1 August 1744 – 18 December 1829), often known simply as Lamarck, was a French naturalist. He was a soldier, biologist, academic, and an early proponent of the idea that evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws. He gave the term biology a broader meaning by coining the term for special sciences, chemistry, meteorology, geology, and botany-zoology.[ref]The Handy Science Answer Book,
 by James E. Bobick; Visible Ink Press, Oct 1, 2002</ref>
Lamarck fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia, and was awarded a commission for bravery on the battlefield.Damkaer (2002), p. 117. At his post in Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine.Packard (1901), p. 15. He retired from the army after being injured in 1766, and returned to his medical studies. Lamarck developed a particular interest in botany, and later, after he published a three-volume work Flore française, he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle was founded in 1793, Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology.
In 1801, he published Système des animaux sans vertèbres, a major work on the classification of invertebrates, a term he coined. In an 1802 publication, he became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense.Coleman (1977), pp. 1–2.[tpl]#tag:ref|The term "biology" was also introduced independently by Thomas Beddoes (in 1799), Karl Friedrich Burdach (in 1800) and Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur, 1802).|group=Note[/tpl] Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.
In the modern era, Lamarck is widely remembered for a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse theory.Jurmain et al. (2011), pp. 27–39. However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, a reflection of the wisdom of the time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of evolution,Ed. Philip Appleman. Darwin: A Norton Critical Edition. 3rd Edition. New York City: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. 44. in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms.Gould (2002), p. 187.

CATEGORIES: Environment of Iceland, Plate tectonics, Underwater ridges of the Atlantic Ocean

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a mid-ocean ridge, a divergent tectonic plate or constructive plate boundary located along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the longest mountain range in the world. In the North Atlantic, it separates the Eurasian and North American Plates, whereas in the South Atlantic it separates the African and South American Plates. The Ridge extends from a junction with the Gakkel Ridge (Mid-Arctic Ridge) northeast of Greenland southward to the Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic. Although the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is mostly an underwater feature, portions of it have enough elevation to extend above sea level. The section of the ridge that includes the island of Iceland is also known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The average spreading rate for the ridge is about 2.5 cm per year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html|title=Understanding plate motions|last=USGS|date=5 May 1999|accessdate=13 March 2011[/tpl]

Before the Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007), Aabybro Municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in North Jutland County on the island of Vendsyssel-Thy, part of the Jutland peninsula, in northern Denmark.  The municipality included several small islands in the Limfjord, the waterway that separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of Vendsyssel-Thy, including Tagholme. Because Aabybro municipality was located on the north shore of the Limfjord, its southern neighbor Aalborg, which is partially located on the Jutland mainland, is partly separated from Aabybro by water. The waters in this area are called Gjøl Bredning.  The cove Vejlen helps to define part of its southern border.
The Aabybro Municipality covered an area of 171 km², and had a total population of 11,388 (2005).  Its latest mayor was Ole Lykkegaard Andersen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.
The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Aabybro.
On January 1, 2007 Aabybro municipality was merged with existing Brovst, Fjerritslev, and Pandrup municipalities to form the new Jammerbugt municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 863 km² and a total population of 38,864 (2005).  The new municipality will belong to the new Region Nordjylland ("North Jutland Region").

Skagen, occasionally known in English as The Scaw, is Denmark's northernmost town and the area surrounding it. Situated on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland, it is part of Frederikshavn Municipality in Region Nordjylland. It is located [tpl]convert|41|km[/tpl] north of Frederikshavn and [tpl]convert|108|km[/tpl] northeast of Aalborg. With its well-developed harbour, Skagen is Denmark's main fishing port and also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting some 2 million people annually.
Originally the name was applied to the peninsula but it now usually refers to the town itself. The settlement began in the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of Impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters. In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.
In the early 1910s, Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built the summer residence Klitgården, completed in 1914. Between the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a peak population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of 1 January 2013 it has 8,220 inhabitants. Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller Skagen Designs have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen's restaurants.
St Lawrence's Church was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by Skagen Church in 1841 designed by Christian Frederik Hansen. It was redeveloped in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgården and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including Brøndums Hotel, Skagens Museum, Michael and Anna Ancher's House, and Drachmann's House.
Skagen's first school was the Latinskole, a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the public school Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej. The primary gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen's Sportscenter was completed in 1974, primary to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idræts Klub, was founded in 1946 and plays in Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in Danish football. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is located some [tpl]convert|17| km|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the town.
Skagen station is the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. Nordjyske Jernbaner operates the local train service between Skagen and Frederikshavn with onward national connections by DSB. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to Gothenburg and Oslo. Aalborg Airport with flights to destinations across Europe is located some [tpl]convert|100|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Skagen. As in other Danish cities, cycling is popular.

Igor Shiklomanov, the man selected by the United Nations to do its world inventory of water resources,  estimated that there are 1386 million cubic kilometres of water on earth.[tpl]cite report|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html|publisher=UNESCO|date=1998|accessdate=13 June 2013|title= World Water Resources: A New Appraisal and Assessment for the 21st Century[/tpl] This includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwaters, glaciers, oceans, lakes and streams. Saline water account for 97.5% of this amount. Fresh water accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water 68.7% is in the "form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and in the mountainous regions. Next, 29.9% exists as fresh groundwaters.

[[Ox-Cart Library]]

CATEGORIES: Libraries in Ohio, Western Reserve

The Oxcart Library is considered to be the first circulating public library in the history of the Western Reserve.  The library is located in the city of North Olmsted, Ohio.
Captain Aaron Olmstead, a wealthy sea captain in the China trade out of New England, was one of 49 investors who formed a syndicate in 1795 to purchase a major part of the Western Reserve from Connecticut. He became the owner of thousands of acres from his $30,000 share of the $120,000 total land deal. The land encompassed the areas now known as North Olmsted, Olmsted Falls and Olmsted Township. At the time of the purchase, the area was known as Lenox. Olmsted traveled west on horseback to visit the land in 1795, but never settled here. He died on 1806. 
In 1826, Aaron's son, Charles Hyde Olmstead, offered to donate 500 books from his father's personal collection in Oxford, Connecticut, if the residents of Lenox agreed to change the name of the area to Olmstead. They did. 
The books traveled by oxcart over 600 miles of rugged terrain. They were individually covered with blue paper and arrived partly stained with mud and rain. The books were housed in various families' homes and circulated to residents in the area. 
Around 150 of the original books can be found in a display case in the North Olmsted Branch Library. The blue paper covers remain on many of the books.

Most of the lights in the United States have been built and maintained by the Coast Guard (since 1939) and its predecessors, the United States Lighthouse Service (1910–1939) and the United States Lighthouse Board (1852–1910).  Before the Lighthouse Board was established, local collectors of customs were responsible for lighthouses under Stephen Pleasonton.  As their importance to navigation has declined and as public interest in them has increased, the Coast Guard has been handing over ownership and in some cases responsibility for running them to other parties, the chief of them being the National Park Service under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000.

[[Food web]]

CATEGORIES: Trophic ecology

A food web (or food cycle) depicts feeding connections (what-eats-what) in an ecological community and hence is also referred to  as a consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs.  A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.
Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book "Animal Ecology"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Elton organized species into functional groups, which was the basis for Raymond Lindeman's classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. Lindeman emphasized the important role of decomposer organisms in a trophic system of classification. The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and his terminology, including an "entangled bank", "web of life", "web of complex relations", and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about "the continued movement of the particles of earth". Even earlier, in 1768 John Bruckner described nature as "one continued web of life".
Food webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups of species that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical) models of trophic or consumer-resource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the topographic structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using network theory had identified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of species richness.

The Continental Divide of the Americas (also known as the Continental Gulf of Division, the Great Divide, or merely the Continental Divide) is the principal, and largely mountainous, hydrological divide of the Americas.  The Continental Divide extends from the Bering Strait to the Strait of Magellan, and separates the watersheds that drain into the Pacific Ocean from (1) those river systems that drain into the Atlantic Ocean (including those that drain into the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea), and (2) along the northernmost reaches of the Divide, those river systems that drain into the Arctic Ocean.
Though there are many other hydrological divides in the Americas, the Great Divide is by far the most prominent of these because it tends to follow a line of high peaks along the main ranges of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, at a generally much higher elevation than the other hydrological divisions.

Bressay Lighthouse is a lighthouse in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, [tpl]convert|4|km[/tpl] south-east of Lerwick. It is located on the island of Bressay at Kirkabister Ness overlooking Bressay Sound.  
It was one of four lighthouses built in Shetland between 1854 and 1858 which were designed by brothers David Stevenson and Thomas Stevenson. David Stevenson initially maintained that building a lighthouse in Shetland waters was impossible, too dangerous and too expensive, and that any ship's captain who took this route was mad. 
The shore station was purchased by the Shetland Amenity Trust in 1995 and has been converted into a Marine Heritage Centre. The fog signal was discontinued in the 1980s. The notable red horn was removed, however, the building that housed the siren is still in place and now houses a radar mast, and the five pressurised air tanks are still in place.

[[Unlawful combatant]]

An unlawful combatant, illegal combatant or unprivileged combatant/belligerent is a civilian or military personnel who directly engages in armed conflict in violation of the laws of war. An unlawful combatant may be detained or prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action; subject of course to international treaties on justice and human rights.ICRC official statement: The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism, 21 July 2005
The Geneva Conventions apply in wars between two or more sovereign states. Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention states that the status of a detainee may be determined by a "competent tribunal". Until such time, he must be treated as a prisoner of war."Unlawful Combatants" in the United States: Drawing the Fine Line Between Law and War Human Rights Magazine Winter 2003, published by the American Bar Association After a "competent tribunal" has determined that an individual detainee is an unlawful combatant, the "detaining power" may choose to accord the detained unlawful combatant the rights and privileges of a prisoner of war as described in the Third Geneva Convention, but is not required to do so. An unlawful combatant who is not a national of a neutral State, and who is not a national of a co-belligerent State, retains rights and privileges under the Fourth Geneva Convention so that he must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial".The legal situation of unlawful/unprivileged combatants (IRRC March 2003 Vol.85 No 849)
While the concept of an unlawful combatant is included in the Third Geneva Convention, the phrase itself does not appear in the document. Article 4 of Third Geneva Convention does describe categories under which a person may be entitled to POW status; and there are other international treaties that deny lawful combatant status for mercenaries and children. In the United States, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 codified the legal definition of this term and invested the U.S. President with broad discretion to determine whether a person may be designated an unlawful enemy combatant under United States law. The assumption that such a category as unlawful combatant exists is not contradicted by the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Celebici Judgment. The judgment quoted the 1958 ICRC commentary on the Fourth Geneva Convention: Every person in enemy hands must be either a prisoner of war and, as such, be covered by the Third Convention; or a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention. Furthermore, "There is no intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law",[ref]The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia "Celebici Judgment: Prosecutor v. Delalic, Mucic, Delic, and Landzo, Case No". IT-96-21-T seems to return the Appeal Judgment instead of the Trial Judgment.

The Geneva Conventions do not recognize any lawful status for combatants in conflicts not involving two or more nation states.

[[Subduction]]
CATEGORIES: Plate tectonics, Geological processes, Subduction zones

In geology, subduction is the process that takes place at convergent boundaries by which one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle as the plates converge. Regions where this process occurs are known as subduction zones. Rates of subduction are typically centimetres per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimetres per year.[tpl]Cite book|last=Defant |first=M. J. |year=1998 |title=Voyage of Discovery: From the Big Bang to the Ice Age |publisher=Mancorp |page=325|isbn=0-931541-61-1 [/tpl]
Plates include both oceanic crust and continental crust. Stable subduction zones involve the oceanic lithosphere of one plate sliding beneath the continental lithosphere or oceanic lithosphere of another plate due to the higher density of the oceanic lithosphere. That is, the subducted lithosphere is always oceanic while the over-riding lithosphere may or may not be oceanic. Subduction zones are sites of high rates of volcanism, earthquakes, and mountain building.
Orogenesis, or mountain-building, occurs when large pieces of material on the subducting plate (such as island arcs) are pressed into the over-riding plate or when subhorizontal contraction occurs in the over-riding plate. These areas are subject to many earthquakes, which are caused by the interactions between the subducting slab and the mantle, the volcanoes, and (when applicable) the mountain-building related to island arc collisions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

Sir Rupert Charles Hart-Davis (28 August 1907 – 8 December 1999) was an English publisher, editor and man of letters.  He founded the publishing company Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd.  As a biographer, he is remembered for his Hugh Walpole (1952), as an editor, for his Collected Letters of Oscar Wilde (1962), and, as both editor and part-author, for the Lyttelton/Hart-Davis Letters.
Working at a publishing firm before World War II, Hart-Davis began to forge literary relationships that would be important later in his career.  Founding his publishing company in 1946, Hart-Davis was praised for the quality of the firm's publications and production; but he  refused to cater to public tastes, and the firm eventually lost money.  After relinquishing control of the firm, Hart-Davis concentrated on writing and editing, producing collections of letters and other works which brought him the sobriquet "the king of editors."

[[Coenwulf of Mercia]]

Coenwulf (also spelled Cenwulf, Kenulf, or Kenwulph) was King of Mercia from December 796 until his death in 821. He was a descendant of a brother of King Penda, who had ruled Mercia in the middle of the 7th century. He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died. In the early years of Coenwulf's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa's control. Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene. When Pope Leo agreed to anathematize Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and had his hands cut off. Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald. Coenwulf's coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control. Several campaigns of Coenwulf's against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.
Coenwulf came into conflict with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury over the issue of whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in the relationship between the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.
He was succeeded by his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims that his son Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed permanently out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former position of power.

Obduction was originally defined by Coleman Coleman, R.G., 1971. Plate tectonic emplacement of upper mantle peridotites along continental edges. J. Geophys. Research, 76:1212-1222 to mean the overthrusting of oceanic lithosphere onto continental lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath continental lithosphere.
Subsequently, this definition has been broadened to mean the emplacement of continental lithosphere by oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary, such as closing of an ocean or a mountain building episode. This process is uncommon because the denser oceanic lithosphere usually subducts underneath the less dense continental plate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Obduction occurs where a fragment of continental crust is caught in a subduction zone with resulting overthrusting of oceanic mafic and ultramafic rocks from the mantle onto the continental crust. Obduction may occur where a small tectonic plate is caught between two larger plates, with the lithosphere (both island arc and oceanic) welding onto an adjacent continent as a new terrane. When two continental plates collide, obduction of the oceanic lithosphere between them is often a part of the resulting orogeny.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

Hwicce was a tribal kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  the kingdom was established in 577, after the Battle of Deorham. After 628 the kingdom became a client or sub-kingdom of Mercia as a result of the Battle of Cirencester.
It was assessed at 7000 hides in the Tribal Hidage, giving it a similar sized economy to the kingdoms of Essex and Sussex.
The exact boundaries of their kingdom are uncertain, though it is likely that they coincided with those of the old Diocese of Worcester, founded in 679–80, the early bishops of which bore the title Episcopus Hwicciorum.  The kingdom would therefore have included Worcestershire except the northwestern tip, Gloucestershire except the Forest of Dean, the southwestern half of Warwickshire, the neighbourhood of Bath north of the Avon, plus small parts of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and north-west Wiltshire.Della Hooke, The Kingdom of the Hwicce (1985), pp.12-13Stephen Yeates, The Tribe of Witches (2008), pp.1-8

Edwin ([tpl]lang-ang|Ēadwine[/tpl]; c. 586 – 12 October 632/633), also known as Eadwine or Æduinus, was the King of Deira and Bernicia – which later became known as Northumbria – from about 616 until his death. He converted to Christianity and was baptised in 627; after he fell at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, he was venerated as a saint.
Edwin was the son of Ælle king of Deira and seems to have had (at least) two siblings. His sister Acha was married to Æthelfrith, king of neighbouring Bernicia. An otherwise unknown sibling fathered Hereric, who in turn fathered Abbess Hilda of Whitby and Hereswith, wife to Æthelric, the brother of king Anna of East Anglia.Higham, Kingdom of Northumbria, p. 80; Kirby, p. 72. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 76, makes Hereric a brother of Edwin.

Æthelfrith (died c. 616) was King of Bernicia from c. 593 until c. 616; he was also, beginning c. 604, the first Bernician king to also rule Deira, to the south of Bernicia. Since Deira and Bernicia were the two basic components of what would later be defined as Northumbria, Æthelfrith can be considered, in historical terms, the first Northumbrian king. He was especially notable for his successes against the Britons and his victory over the Gaels of Dál Riata. Although he was defeated and killed in battle and replaced by a dynastic rival, his line was eventually restored to power in the 630s.

After graduating from Westminster School in Central London, from where he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, he joined Alan Lloyd Hodgkin to study nerve impulses. Their eventual discovery of the basis propagation of nerve impulses (called action potential) earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. They made their discovery from the giant axon of the Atlantic squid. Soon after the outbreak of Second World War, Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command and later transferred to the Admiralty. After the war he resumed research at Cambridge University, where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres. In 1952 he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the "sliding filament theory", which is the foundation of modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and President in 1980. The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1973 for his collective contribution to nerve impulse and muscle contraction. He was conferred Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1983. He was fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, until his death.

Ratramnus, (died c. 870) a Frankish monk of the monastery of Corbie, was a Carolingian theologian known best for his writings on the Eucharist and predestination. His Eucharistic treatise, De corpora et sanguine Domini (On the Body and Blood of the Lord), was a counterpoint to his abbot Paschasius Radbertus’ realist Eucharistic theology. Ratramnus was also known for his defense of the monk Gottschalk, whose theology of double predestination was the center of much controversy in 9th century France and Germany. In his own time, Ratramnus was perhaps best known for his Against the Objections of the Greeks who Slandered the Roman Church, a response to the Photian schism and defense of the filioque addition to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.G.E.

Ine was King of Wessex from 688 to 726. He was unable to retain the territorial gains of his predecessor, Cædwalla, who had brought much of southern England under his control and expanded West Saxon territory substantially. By the end of Ine's reign, the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Essex were no longer under West Saxon domination; however, Ine maintained control of what is now Hampshire, and consolidated and extended Wessex's territory in the western peninsula.
Ine is noted for his code of laws (Ine's laws or laws of Ine), which he issued in about 694. These laws were the first issued by an Anglo-Saxon king outside Kent. They shed much light on the history of Anglo-Saxon society, and reveal Ine's Christian convictions. Trade increased significantly during Ine's reign, with the town of Hamwic (now Southampton) becoming prominent. It was probably during Ine's reign that the West Saxons began to mint coins, though none have been found that bear his name.
Ine abdicated in 726 to go to Rome, leaving, in the words of the contemporary chronicler Bede, the kingdom to "younger men". He was succeeded by Æthelheard.

[[Cynewulf of Wessex]]

CATEGORIES: West Saxon monarchs, 786 deaths, 8th-century English monarchs, Year of birth unknown, House of Wessex, Burials at Winchester Cathedral

Cynewulf (meaning "kin wolf") was the King of Wessex from 757 until his death in 786.
Cynewulf became king after his predecessor, Sigeberht, was deposed. He may have come to power under the influence of Æthelbald of Mercia, since he was recorded as a witness to a charter of Æthelbald shortly thereafter. It was not long before Æthelbald was assassinated, however, and Mercia fell into a brief period of disorder as rival claimants to its throne fought. Cynewulf took the opportunity to assert the independence of Wessex: about 758, he took Berkshire from the Mercians. Cynewulf was also often at war with the Welsh.
In 779, Cynewulf was defeated by Offa of Mercia at the Battle of Bensington, and Offa then retook Berkshire, and perhaps also London. Despite this defeat, there is no evidence to suggest Cynewulf subsequently became subject to Offa (as his successor, Beorhtric, did).
In 786 Cynewulf was surprised and killed, with all his Thegns present, at Merantune (now called Marten, a hamlet in the county of Wiltshire), by Cyneheard the Atheling, brother of the deposed Sigeberht. Some historians have speculated that the relation of this in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle may be an application of a traditional story and not accurate in its details.
The murder of Cynewulf was also considered to have taken place at Merton in Surrey, but modern historians, including the Rev G. H. Godwin now ascribe it to some place of the same name near Winchester. Trevelyan believes it to have been Merton, Surrey, however. See his History of England, Longmans, 1947 p. 68

Spielplatz was founded in 1929 by Charles Macaskie and his wife Dorothy. They moved from London into a tent on an area of virgin woodland they purchased near Bricket Wood. They called their utopian camp the Green Monastery and a Play Place (Spielplatz).
They were joined by other couples and individuals on weekends. Among their visitors until 1947 was Ross Nichols, founder of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. In turn he attracted both fellow Druids and Gerald Gardner, who later established his first coven at Bricket Wood in his development of Wicca as a modern religion.
It was at Spielplatz that Ross Nichols first met Gerald Gardner.Druid Mysteries, Philip Carr-Gomm
Spielplatz has featured in many films such as Naked…As Nature Intended (1961) starring club member Pamela Green, Nudist Memories (1959)  and  Confettii (2006).

Æthelnoth (also Ethelnoth, Ednoth, or Eadnodus; died 1038) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended from an earlier English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to becoming archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome and brought back saint's relics. He consecrated a number of other bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little evidence of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.

Stigand (died 1072) was an English churchman in pre-Norman Conquest England. His birth date is unknown, but by 1020 he was serving as a royal chaplain and advisor. He was named Bishop of Elmham in 1043, and was later Bishop of Winchester and Archbishop of Canterbury. Stigand was as an advisor to several members of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. Excommunicated by several popes for his pluralism in holding the two sees, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror. Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester, where he died without regaining his liberty.
Stigand served King Cnut as a chaplain at a royal foundation at Ashingdon in 1020, and as an advisor then and later. He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut. When Cnut's stepson Edward the Confessor succeeded Harthacnut, Stigand in all probability became England's main administrator. Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church, and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand's were the royal estates and those of Harold Godwinson.
In 1043 Edward appointed Stigand to the see of Elmham. Four years later, in 1047, he was appointed to the see of Winchester and then in 1052 to the archdiocese of Canterbury, which Stigand held jointly with that of Winchester. Five successive popes, including Nicholas II and Alexander II, excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury. Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066. After Harold's death, Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror. On Christmas Day 1066, Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned William King of England. Stigand's excommunication meant that he could only assist at the coronation.
Despite growing pressure for his deposition, Stigand continued to attend the royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of the view that the English church was backward and needed reform.

Psychoanalytic theory refers to the definition of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that underlie and guide the psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939,Tere sa de Lauretis, Freud's Drive (Basingstoke 2008) p. 3 and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected.Blumenthal, Ralph."Did Freud's Isolation Lead Him to Reverse Theory on Neurosis?"

[[Fief]]

CATEGORIES: Feudalism, Real property law

A fee or fief (Latin: feudum) was the central element of feudalism and consisted of heritable property or rights granted by an overlord to a vassal (or, specifically, a feoffee) who held it in fealty (or "in fee") in return for a form of feudal allegiance and service, usually given by the personal ceremonies of homage and fealty. The fees were often lands or revenue-producing real property held in feudal land tenure: these are typically known as fiefs or fiefdoms. However, not only land but anything of value could be held in fee, including governmental office, rights of exploitation such as hunting or fishing, monopolies in trade, and tax farms.

A lur, also lure or lurr, is a long natural blowing horn without finger holes that is played by embouchure. Lurs can be straight or curved in various shapes. The purpose of the curves was to make long instruments easier to carry (e.g. for marching, like the modern sousaphone) and to prevent directing the loud noise at nearby people.
The name lur is particularly given to two distinct types of ancient wind instruments. The more recent type is made of wood and was in use in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages. The older type, named after the more recent type, is made of bronze, dates to the Bronze Age and was often found in pairs, deposited in bogs, mainly in Denmark and Germany. It consists of a mouthpiece and several pieces and/or pipes.  Its length can reach between 1.5 meters and 2 meters. It has been found in Norway, Denmark, South Sweden, and Northern Germany. Illustrations of lurs have also been found on several rock paintings in Scandinavia.

CATEGORIES: Plan 9 from Bell Labs, Inferno (operating system), Free special purpose file systems

The plumber, in the Plan 9 from Bell Labs and Inferno operating systems, is a mechanism for reliable uni- or multicast inter-process communication of formatted textual messages.  It uses the Plan 9 network file protocol, 9P, rather than a special-purpose IPC mechanism.
Any number of clients may listen on a named port (a file) for messages.  Ports and port routing are defined by plumbing rules. These rules are dynamic.  Each listening program receives a copy of matching messages. For example, if the data /sys/lib/plumb/basic is plumbed with the standard rules, it is sent to the edit port.  The port will write a copy of the message to each listener.  In this case, all running editors will interpret this message as a file name, and open the file.
The plumber is the 9P file server that provides this service.  Clients may use libplumb to format messages.  Since the messages are 9P, they are network transparent.

Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour, KG, OM, PC, DL ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|l|f|ʊər[/tpl]; 25 July 1848 – 19 March 1930) was a British Conservative politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from July 1902 to December 1905. When he came into his inheritance at 21, Balfour became one of the wealthiest young men in Britain. He rose to prominence by suppressing agrarian unrest in Ireland through punitive action combined with measures against absentee landlords. After being influential in government, he succeeded his uncle, Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in July 1902.
Balfour was seen as an ambivalent personality and a weak Prime Minister. His embrace of the imperial preference championed by Joseph Chamberlain was nuanced, but brought resignations and the end of his spell as party leader. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. He oversaw the Entente Cordiale, an agreement with France that influenced Britain's decision to join the First World War. In 1915 he became Foreign Secretary in David Lloyd George's wartime administration, but was frequently left out of the inner workings of government, although the declaration of 1917 promising Jews a "national home" in Palestine bore his name. He resigned as Foreign Secretary following the Versailles Conference in 1919, dying 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent an inherited fortune. He never married.
Balfour trained as a philosopher – he originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truth – and had a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: "Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all".

The priory was unusual in having military-style defences and is widely regarded as one of the finest fortified religious buildings in Britain. Over the centuries the priory has sustained some damage, and following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was, like many of its kind, converted into a private house, which is still inhabited by its current owners, the Turbervill family. The priory is not open to the public apart from the church, where restoration work has recently been carried out by Cadw.

[[Chinese mythology]]

CATEGORIES: Chinese mythology, Chinese folk religion

Chinese mythology refers to those myths found in the historical geographic area of China: these include myths in Chinese and other languages, as transmitted by Han Chinese as well as other ethnic groups (of which fifty-six are officially recognized by the current administration of China).(Yang, 4) Chinese mythology includes creation myths and legends, such as myths concerning the founding of Chinese culture and the Chinese state. As in many cultures' mythologies, Chinese mythology has in the past been believed to be, at least in part, a factual recording of history. Thus, in the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version.Yang, 12-13
The dozens of ethnic minority groups of the country of China have their own languages and their own folklore, and many have their own writing: much of which contains valuable historical and cultural information as well as many unique myths. Some myths are widely shared across multiple ethnic groups, but may exist as versions with some differences.
Historians have written evidence of Chinese mythological symbolism from the 12th century BC in the Oracle bone script. Legends were passed down for over a thousand years before being written in books such as Shan Hai Jing. Other myths continued to be passed down through oral traditions like theater and song before being recorded as novels such as Hei'an Zhuan (Epic of Darkness).
Imperial historical documents and philosophical canons such as Classic of History, Records of the Grand Historian, Classic of Rites, and Lüshi Chunqiu all contain Chinese myths.

[[Dymock]]

CATEGORIES: Forest of Dean, Villages in Gloucestershire, Romanesque architecture in England, Post towns in the GL postcode area

Dymock is a small village in the Forest of Dean district of Gloucestershire, England, about four miles south of Ledbury, with a population of approx. 300 people.
It was the eponymous home of the Dymock poets from the period 1911-1914.  The homes of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson and the American-born Robert Frost can still be seen there. Dymock is renowned for its wild daffodils in the spring, and these were  probably the inspiration for the line "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood" in Frost's  poem The Road Not Taken, which was a gentle satire on his great friend, and fellow Dymock Poet, Edward Thomas. In 2011 the village featured on Countryfile, where the Dymock poets were looked into in more detail.
Dymock is the origin of the Dymock Red, a cider apple, and Stinking Bishop cheese.
In the village of Dymock there are several interesting buildings which include cruck beam cottages; "The White House", which was the birthplace of John Kyrle - the "Man of Ross" in 1637, Ann Cam School of 1825 and St Mary's Church, a patchwork history in brick and stone with Anglo-Norman origins. Nearby stands the only remaining village pub, which was purchased by Parish Council to help preserve a thriving village. The pub is rented and run by a landlord and supported by a local fundraising and social committee "Friends of the Beauchamp Arms" (FOBA).
Dymock was served by the Hereford & Gloucester Canal, opened in 1845; this closed in 1881 and the section between Ledbury and Gloucester converted into a railway line, a branch line of the Great Western Railway, though a stretch between Dymock and Newent was by-passed as it was decided not to take the line through the 2,192 yard Oxenhall Tunnel. Dymock had a station on this line. The line closed in 1959, but the canal (including the tunnel), is now being restored.
Dymock gave its name to a school of Romanesque sculpture first described in the book The Dymock School of Sculpture by Eric Gethin Jones (1979). The school is noted for its use of stepped volute capitals and its stylised "tree of life" motif on tympana.
Dymock is the ancestral home of the Dymoke family who are the Royal Champions of England. It is thought that the Dymokes first lived at Knight's Green, an area just outside of the village of Dymock.

Lascelles Abercrombie (also known as the Georgian Laureate, linking him with the "Georgian poets") (9 January 1881 – 27 October 1938) was a British poet and literary critic, one of the "Dymock poets".  He was born in Ashton upon MerseyChambers Biographical Dictionary, ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 4 and educated at Malvern College,Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature (1995) Merriam-Webster Inc. p.3. ISBN 978-0-87779-042-6 and at Owens College.
Before the First World War, he lived for a time at Dymock in Gloucestershire, part of a community that included Rupert Brooke and Robert Frost. Edward Thomas also visited. During these early years, he worked as a journalist, and he started his poetry writing. His first book Interludes and Poems (1908), followed by Mary and the Bramble (1910), and the poem Deborah, and finally the books Emblems of Love (1912) and Speculative Dialogues (1913). 
During World War I, he served as a munitions examiner, after which, he was appointed  to the first lectureship in poetry at the University of Liverpool. In 1922 he was appointed Professor of English at the University of Leeds in preference to J. R. R. Tolkien, with whom he shared, as author of The Epic (1914), a professional interest in heroic poetry.Humphrey Carpenter, J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography, 1977, 114. In 1929 he moved on to the University of London, and in 1935 to a prestigious readership at Oxford University.  He wrote a series of works on the nature of poetry, including The Idea of Great Poetry (1925) and Romanticism (1926). Abercrombie repeated in volume after volume the same view of the nature of poetry -- that it is the representation of the poet's own imaginative experience, conveyed by literary technique to the reader, in whom the same experience is then replicated. The lack of a discussion of such topics in English universities at the time meant that the limitations in this view were not pointed out, and Abercrombie lacked the stimulus of a critical response that would have helped him to amend and develop his theory. His critical studies of Hardy (1912) and Wordsworth (published posthumously) belonged to a much more familiar genre, and were remembered longer.
He also published several volumes of original verse, largely metaphysical poems in dramatic form, and a number of verse plays. His poems and plays were collected in 'Poems' (1930). In the same year he published separately his most ambitious poem, 'The Sale of Saint Thomas' in six 'Acts'.  A number of fellow poets and professors of literature (including Oliver Elton, Charles Williams and Una Ellis-Fermor) See See Oliver Elton, ‘Lascelles Abercrombie 1881-1938’, Proceedings of the Royal Academy 25 (1939), and Charles Williams, Poetry at Present (Oxford, 1930). In a letter of 1944 (cited by C.L. Sastri, Abercrombie’s Poems, Waltair 1971, 170-1) Una Ellis-Fermor described Abercrombie as ‘one of the finest metaphysical and religious poets of the country and this century’.  admired the sublimity of his themes and his ability to clothe metaphysical thought in vivid imagery.
Abercrombie is remembered today less for his writings than because of his close friendship with Edward Marsh, Rupert Brooke, and other 'Georgian' poets.
He was the brother of the architect Patrick Abercrombie and the father of the phonetician David Abercrombie and the cell biologist Michael Abercrombie.  A grandson, Jeff Cooper, produced an admirable bibliography of his grandfather, with brief but important notes, while a great-grandson of the poet is the author Joe Abercrombie.

[[Cleruchy]]

CATEGORIES: Greek colonization, Athenian Empire

A cleruchy ([tpl]Lang-el|κληρουχία[/tpl], klēroukhia) in Classical Greece, was a specialized type of colony established by Athens. The term comes from the Greek word [tpl]lang|grc|κληροῦχος[/tpl], klērouchos, literally "lot-holder".
Normally, Greek colonies were politically independent; they would have a special relationship with the mother city the metropolis, but would otherwise be independent entities. Cleruchies were significantly different. The settlers or cleruchs would retain their Athenian citizenship and the community remained a political dependency of Athens. 
Cleruchies were established as a means of exporting excess and generally impoverished populations to conveniently distant localities, such as the Thracian Chersonese on the far side of the Aegean Sea. Under the cleruchy arrangement, the participating citizen received a plot (or kleros) of agricultural land, hence a means to earn his livelihood. This elevated the citizen to the property class of zeugitai. The cleruch would be obliged to defend his colony by serving it as a hoplite.
This arrangement benefited Athens in three principal ways:
The first known cleruchy is thought to have been Salamis, captured by Athens from Megara in the 6th century BC. Other cleruchies were established on the Thracian Chersonese following its recapture from the Persian Empire after the Greco-Persian Wars of the 5th century BC, and at Chalcis following that city's defeat in a war with Athens. During the period of the Delian League and the Second Athenian League (5th–4th century BC), many more cleruchies were created by Athens such as on Samos Island proved worthy in the Social War.

The Rough Riders is the name bestowed on the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, one of three such regiments raised in 1898 for the Spanish-American War and the only one of the three to see action. The United States Army was weakened and left with little manpower after the American Civil War roughly thirty years prior. As a result, President William McKinley called upon 1,250 volunteers to assist in the war efforts.Paul Mathingham Hutton, "T.R. takes charge," American History 33.n3 (August, 1998), 30(11).  It was also called "Wood's Weary Walkers" after its first commander, Colonel Leonard Wood, as an acknowledgment of the fact that despite being a cavalry unit they ended up fighting on foot as infantry. Wood's second in command was former assistant secretary of the United States Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, a man who had pushed for American involvement in Cuban independence.  When Colonel Wood became commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, the Rough Riders then became "Roosevelt's Rough Riders." That term was familiar in 1898, from Buffalo Bill who called his famous western show "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World." The Rough Riders were mostly made of college athletes, cowboys, and ranchers.

Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 30, 1965 by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, "Desolation Row". Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s "started" with this album.
Leading with the hit single "Like a Rolling Stone", the album features songs that Dylan has continued to perform live over his long career, including "Ballad of a Thin Man" and "Highway 61 Revisited". He named the album after the major American highway which connected his birthplace, Duluth, Minnesota, to southern cities famed for their musical heritage, including St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, and the Delta blues area of Mississippi.
Highway 61 Revisited peaked at number three in the United States charts and number four in the United Kingdom. The album was ranked number four on Rolling Stone[tpl]'[/tpl]s "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". "Like a Rolling Stone" was a top-10 hit in several countries, and was listed at number one on Rolling Stone[tpl]'[/tpl]s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in Mahāyāna Buddhism and its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the Bodhisattva Path. 
The practice of Prajñāpāramitā is elucidated and described in the genre of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, which vary widely in length and exhaustiveness. The Prajñāpāramitā sūtras suggest that all things including oneself, appear as thoughtforms (conceptual constructs).Williams, Paul. Buddhist Thought. Routledge, 2000, pages 134-5.Williams, Paul.

A player piano (also known as pianola or autopiano) is a self-playing piano, containing a pneumatic or electro-mechanical mechanism that operates the piano action via pre-programmed music perforated paper, or in rare instances, metallic rolls. The rise of the player piano grew with the rise of the mass-produced piano for the home in the late 19th and early 20th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Roehl|first=Harvey|title=Player Piano Treasury|year=1973|publisher=Vestal Press|isbn=0-911572-00-7|pages=316[/tpl] Sales peaked in 1924, then declined as the improvement in phonograph recordings due to electrical recording methods developed in the mid-1920s.  The advent of electrical amplification in home music reproduction via radio in the same period helped cause their eventual decline in popularity, and the stock market crash of 1929 virtually wiped out production.

CATEGORIES: Nanomaterials, Materials

A diamondoid, in the context of building materials for nanotechnology components, most generally refers to structures that resemble diamond in a broad sense:  namely, strong, stiff structures containing dense, 3-D networks of covalent bonds, formed chiefly from first and second row atoms with a valence of three or more.  Examples of diamondoid structures would include crystalline diamond, sapphire, and other stiff structures similar to diamond but with various atom substitutions which might include N, O, Si, S, and so forth.  Sp²-hybridized carbon structures that – in contrast to sp³-hybridized carbon in diamond – arrange in planar sheets ("graphene" sheets) are sometimes also included in the class of diamondoid materials for nanotechnology, e.g., graphite, carbon nanotubes consisting of sheets of carbon atoms rolled into tubes, spherical buckminsterfullerenes and other graphene structures.

[[Patience (poem)]]
CATEGORIES: British poems, Middle English literature, 14th-century works, Cotton Library

Patience is a Middle English alliterative poem written in the late 14th century. Its unknown author, designated the Pearl-Poet or Gawain-Poet, also appears, on the basis of dialect and stylistic evidence, to be the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Cleanness (all ca. 1360-1395) and may have composed St. Erkenwald. This is thought to be true because the techniques and vocabulary of regional dialect of the unknown author is that of Northwest Midlands, located between Shropshire and Lancashire.
The manuscript, Cotton Nero A.x is in the British Museum. The first published edition was in Early English Alliterative Poems in the West Midland Dialect of the fourteenth century, printed by the Early English Text Society.
Of Patience, considered the slightest of the four poems, its only manifest source is the Vulgate Bible. It also resembles a Latin poem by Tertullian and Bishop Marbod. There are certain mannerisms found in Patience that Pearl does not have. For instance, both homilies clearly follow the same pattern: 1. statement of theme, 2. announcement of the text from the New Testament, 3. discussion of another passage from the New Testament in elucidation of that text, 4. and elaborate paraphrase of exemplum or exempla, from the Old Testament.

The Luck of Barry Lyndon is a picaresque novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, first published in serial form in 1844, about a member of the Irish gentry trying to become a member of the English aristocracy. Thackeray, who based the novel on the life and exploits of the Anglo-Irish rake and fortune-hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney, later reissued it under the title The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq..
Stanley Kubrick later adapted the novel into the movie Barry Lyndon (1975). Unlike the film, the novel is narrated by Barry himself, who functions as a quintessentially unreliable narrator, perpetually boasting and not realising the bad light in which he casts himself.

[[Official Irish Republican Army]]

CATEGORIES: Irish Republican Army, Proscribed paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland, Proscribed paramilitary organizations in the Republic of Ireland, National liberation movements, Military wings of political parties

The Official Irish Republican Army or Official IRA (OIRA) was an Irish republican paramilitary group whose goal was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a "workers' republic" encompassing all of Ireland.Statement from Cathal Goulding, C/S of the Official IRA, in early 1972, quoted in On Our Knees by Rosita Sweetman, Pan Books, London. 1972. ISBN 0-330-23320-3. p. 146 It emerged in December 1969, shortly after the beginning of the Troubles, when the Irish Republican Army split into two main factions. The other group emerging from this split was the Provisional IRA. Both groups continued to refer to themselves as simply "the IRA" and rejected the legitimacy of the other. Unlike the "Provisionals", the "Officials" were Marxist and thus were sometimes referred to as the Red IRA.Rekawek, Kacper.

[[Robot-sumo]]

CATEGORIES: Robot combat

Robot-sumo, or pepe-sumo, is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots.
The engineering challenges are for the robot to find its opponent (usually accomplished with infrared or ultra-sonic sensors) and to push it out of the flat arena. A robot should also avoid leaving the arena, usually by means of a sensor that detects the edge.
The most common "weapon" used in a sumobot competition is an angled blade at the front of the robot, usually tilted at about a 45-degree angle towards the back of the robot. This blade has an adjustable height for different tactics.
Robot-sumo is divided into classes, fought on progressively smaller arenas:
There is also Lego Mindstorms NXT sumo robots, in which NXT robots go at it. The robots usually have to fit in a one foot cube.
Classes are further divided into remote-controlled and autonomous robots. Also, there might be a tethered category (varies)
Sumo robots are built from scratch, from kits or from Lego components, particularly the Lego Mindstorms sets.
Some sumo bots are built with only wood and motors for more of a challenge. The usual size for the wood is 12" by 12".
It makes it hard to construct a really large robot with this piece of wood. Other common kits for sumobots come from OWI Robotics or Lynxmotion.

John Redcorn IIISpin the Choice (voiced by Victor Aaron Season 1, Jonathan Joss Season 2 - 13), is a character in the animated series King of the Hill. He is addressed or referred to as "John Redcorn" or "Mr. Redcorn" by every character in the series, and very rarely just "John" or "Johnny."
A former roadie for Winger[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.CCBanana.com/sludge/rewindkipwinger.htm | title=Metal Sludge Rewind with Kip Winger | publisher=Metal Sludge | accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl] and "Licensed New Age Healer",M Keith Booker, Harcourt Education, Inc NetLibrary, Drawn to Television (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006), 72. he is Nancy Gribble's Native AmericanUniversity of California, Los Angeles American Indian Culture and Research Center, American Indian Culture and Research Journal (American Indian Culture and Research Center, University of California, 2003 Item notes: v.27 2003), 23. masseur, her lover of 14 years (the two split up during the show's fourth season) and the biological father of Joseph Gribble. Both Dale and Joseph are completely unaware of this, although it is obvious to everyone else in the neighborhood, due to the close resemblance between Joseph and Redcorn. He has a sister, who Nancy seems to assume told everyone about their affair. A recurring gag is that whenever Dale makes a comment about being Joseph's father, John Redcorn shows up.
In episode 38 (3:3), Peggy Hill, still oblivious to the relationship between John Redcorn and Nancy Gribble, goes to Redcorn for help with a real headache. When Hank confronts Redcorn, he says he would never "heal" Peggy the way he heals "other women". The implication is that Redcorn is somewhat known as a womanizer.
John Redcorn drives a tan Jeep Wrangler, and becomes the lead singer of the band Big Mountain Fudgecake, for which Lucky plays guitar and Dale is briefly the manager. Following the breakup of the band, Redcorn begins singing toned-down solo acoustic children's versions of his songs at the Strickland company barbecue and becomes instantly popular. It was revealed that Big Mountain Fudgecake got back together near the end of the episode "Earthly Girls are Easy". When driving, he is often heard playing Pat Benatar including the hits "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" and "Heartbreaker". He is also notable for playing music from the band Foreigner, such as "Hotblooded" and "Double Vision." Redcorn is often seen reading a book about Native American rights in North America, entitled This Land is Our Land. A recurring gag is that when he begins speaking about matters related to Native traditions and their spiritual meanings, Redcorn's long black hair is dramatically whisked up in a breeze. Despite Redcorn's dedication to his heritage, it has sometimes backfired on him. When Bobby Hill becomes interested in Native American rights, Redcorn seems pleased (although his original intention was to get Joseph interested in his heritage). However, Bobby unknowingly says that Redcorn's tribe engaged in cannibalism, which then causes a mortified Redcorn having to explain to everyone how that practice was discontinued centuries ago.
He is most known for his affairs with Dale's wife Nancy, which Dale never finds out about, despite how obvious it is. As a recurring gag, Dale sees several signs of the affair, but always draws the wrong conclusions; on one occasion, he finds him trying to sneak inside to have sex with Nancy, but thinks he is trying to steal his mower. When Dale reports having a vision of a Native American making love with his wife, he then assumes that means he is part Native American himself. John Redcorn's access to Nancy is caused primarily by Dale ignorantly allowing him to be her masseur,  and often trusting her to him to keep her away from other men who may have affairs with her. It is revealed in Season 6 that Dale believes Redcorn to be gay, which partially explains his contentment with letting him be alone with his wife so often. 
Redcorn has a predictably difficult relationship with Dale; though he considers him a good man, he is jealous of his relationship with Nancy and Joseph, and exasperated by how Dale's eccentricities influence Joseph. Redcorn seems depressed that he was not more a father to Joseph, which is later partially resolved when Nancy reveals to Joseph that since they all are "from the Earth", John and Joseph are in fact related. In Nancy's Boys, after Dale helps him with a lawsuit against the Federal government, Redcorn calls Dale "a true friend" and cites this as a reason for agreeing to split up with Nancy; he made a similar comment to Hank regarding Peggy in an earlier episode. However, later in the series, he would (unsuccessfully) attempt to get back together with Nancy.
In the episode Season 12 "Three Men and a Bastard", John Redcorn finds out he had a daughter, named Kate, by a woman named Charlene (who had a son three years after the affair with John Redcorn; the father of her son is not talked about), during the same period that he was having an affair with Nancy Gribble. Though John Redcorn had forgotten about it since, and Nancy was not happy when she learned about his double affair. This woman had fallen for Bill and had moved her family in with him; likewise, Kate and Joseph fell for each other, which disturbed all the characters aware of the children's shared parentage. At the end of the episode, Charlene and her two kids leave Bill and move in with John Redcorn, although they are never seen or mentioned for the rest of the series.

MC5 was an American rock band from Lincoln Park, Michigan, formed in 1964. The original band line-up consisted of vocalist Rob Tyner, guitarists Wayne Kramer and Fred "Sonic" Smith, bassist Michael Davis, and drummer Dennis Thompson. "Crystallizing the counterculture movement at its most volatile and threatening",[tpl]cite web|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist |id=p4864 |pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=MC5 |publisher=AllMusic |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2011-07-06[/tpl] according to Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the MC5's far left political ties and anti-establishment lyrics and music positioned them as emerging innovators of the punk movement in the United States. Their loud, energetic style of back-to-basics rock 'n' roll included elements of garage rock, hard rock, blues rock, and psychedelic rock.
MC5 had a promising beginning which earned them a January 1969 cover appearance in Rolling Stone and a story written by Eric Ehrmann before their debut album was released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/1969-rolling-stone-covers-20040506/rs025-80263083 |title=1969 Rolling Stone Covers Pictures - RS025 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1969-01-12 |accessdate=2012-12-18[/tpl] They developed a reputation for energetic and polemical live performances, one of which was recorded as their 1969 debut album Kick Out the Jams. Their initial run was short-lived, though within just a few years of their dissolution in 1972, MC5 were often cited as one of the most important American hard rock groups of their era.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists: 1-50 |publisher=Rock On The Net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18[/tpl] Their three albums are regarded by many as classics, and their song "Kick Out the Jams" is widely covered.
Tyner died of a heart attack in late 1991 at the age of 46. Smith also died of a heart attack, in 1994 at the age of 45. The remaining three members of the band reformed in 2003 with The Dictators' singer Handsome Dick Manitoba as its new vocalist, and this reformed line-up occasionally performed live over the next nine years until Davis died of liver failure in February 2012 at the age of 68.

Synchronicity is the experience of two or more events as meaningfully related, where they are unlikely to be causally related. The subject sees it as a meaningful coincidence. The concept of synchronicity was first described by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychologist, in the 1920s.[tpl]cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche  |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50[/tpl]
The concept does not question, or compete with, the notion of causality. Instead, it maintains that just as events may be connected by a causal line, they may also be connected by meaning. A grouping of events by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of a concrete sense of cause and effect.
In addition to Jung, Arthur Koestler wrote extensively on synchronicity in The Roots of Coincidence.Koestler, Arthur (1973). The Roots of Coincidence. Vintage. ISBN 0-394-71934-4.

[[Valence band]]

CATEGORIES: Electronic band structures

In solids, the valence band is the highest range of electron energies in which electrons are normally present at absolute zero temperature.
The valence electrons are bound to individual atoms, as opposed to conduction electrons (found in conductors and semiconductors), which can move freely within the atomic lattice of the material. On a graph of the electronic band structure of a material, the valence band is located below the conduction band, separated from it in insulators and semiconductors by a band gap. In metals, the conduction band has no energy gap separating it from the valence band. 
To understand the concept of a valence band, it is important to consider the atomic structure of a metal first. For example lithium (Li) atoms with electronic configuration 1s22s1 can form only one covalent bond. However, when forming a bulk metal, Li atoms come to a resonance structure by taking 1 electron from its neighbouring Li atom and the resultant electronic configuration becomes 1s22s12p1 (e-). As a result of this electron sharing, its neighbouring Li atom loses an electron and comes to an electronic configuration of 1s2 (e+). The Li (e-) atoms now gain the capability to form two covalent bonds thus can form a bulk metal. Inside the metal Li (e+) remain alone (not bonded) but nullify the negative charges of the neighbouring Li atoms thus forming a lithium metal matrix. 
In a three-dimensional (3D) metal structure of Li, the molecular orbital formation starts from the lower energy level orbitals, i.e. first 1s, then 2s, then 2p. The molecular bond formation is a rapid process and as a result it is seen that 2s orbitals come to totally filled condition whereas the 2p orbitals only partially filled during that time span, and the remaining part of the 2p orbitals remain empty (no electron). In between there is an overlapped zone of totally filled 2s and totally filled 2p orbitals, called overlapped zone.
For any metal this is the rule of forming a metal from its atoms. The totally filled orbitals with highest range of electron energies form valence band (the filled 2s orbitals in the example of Li), the empty orbital with no electrons is called the conduction band (the empty region of 2p orbitals in the example of Li).
The overlapping depends on the interatomic distance (rd) and also on the energy level of the orbitals. If (rd) is large or the orbitals are of large energy level then there may be small overlapping or no overlapping leaving a band gap (Eg). 
The electrical conductivity of a metal depends on its capability to flow electrons from valence band to conduction band. Hence in case of a metal with large overlapped region the electrical conductivity is high along with good metallic property. If there is a small forbidden zone then the flow of electron from valence to conduction band is only possible if an external energy (thermal etc.) is supplied and these groups with small Eg are called semiconductors. If the Eg is sufficiently high then flow of electron from valence to conduction band become negligible under normal conditions, these groups are called insulators. 
Semiconductors and insulators owe their low conductivity to the properties of the valence band in those materials. The number of electrons in the solid is precisely equal to the number of states available up to the top of the valence band (assuming the valence band is full). There are no available states in the band gap. This means that when an electric field is applied, the electrons cannot increase their energy (i.e., accelerate) because there are no states available to the electrons where they would be moving faster than they are already going.
There is some conductivity in semiconductors, however. This is due to thermal excitation—some of the electrons get enough energy to jump the band gap in one go. Once they are in the conduction band, they can conduct electricity, as can the hole they left behind in the valence band. The hole is an empty state that allows electrons in the valence band some degree of freedom.

Northwest Airlines Corp. (often abbreviated NWA) was a major United States airline founded in 1926 and absorbed into Delta Air Lines Inc. by a merger. Approved on October 29, 2008, the merger made Delta the largest airline in the world.Letter from Northwest Archived April 17, 2008.

Northwest was headquartered in Eagan, Minnesota near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. After World War II it became dominant in the trans-Pacific market with a hub in Tokyo, Japan (initially Haneda Airport, later Narita International Airport). After acquiring Republic Airlines in 1986, Northwest also established major hubs at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and Memphis International Airport. In 1993 it began a strategic alliance with KLM and a jointly-coordinated European hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The Detroit and Minneapolis operations were retained as Delta hubs.  However, the Memphis operation has been reduced from more than 300 to fewer than 100 flights a day, and the nonstop service to Amsterdam has been terminated.

Robert Edward "Bob" Crane (July 13, 1928 – June 29, 1978) was an American actor and disc jockey. 
Crane began his career as a disc jockey in New York and Connecticut before moving to Los Angeles where he hosted the number-one rated morning show. In the early 1960s, he moved into acting. Crane is best known for his performance as Colonel Robert E. Hogan in the CBS sitcom Hogan's Heroes. The series aired from 1965 to 1971, and Crane received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his work on the series.
After Hogan's Heroes ended, Crane's career declined. He became frustrated with the few roles he was being offered and began doing dinner theater. In 1975, he returned to television in the NBC series The Bob Crane Show. The series received poor ratings and was canceled after 13 weeks. Afterwards, Crane returned to performing in dinner theaters and also appeared in occasional guest spots on television.
While on tour for his play Beginner's Luck in June 1978, Crane was found bludgeoned to death in his Scottsdale apartment, a murder that remains officially unsolved.

Self-help, or self-improvement, is a self-guided improvementAPA Dictionary of Psychology, 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: American Psychological Association, 2007.—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial psychological basis.  Many different self-help groupings exist and each has its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. "Self-help culture, particularly Twelve-Step culture, has provided some of our most robust new language: recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency."[ref]
Micki McGee,. Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life (Oxford 2005) p. 188[/ref]
Self-help often utilizes publicly available information or support groups, on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together. From early examples in self-driven legal practiceSteve Salerno (2005) Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless, ISBN 1-4000-5409-5 pp. 24–25 and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to education, business, psychology and psychotherapy, commonly distributed through the popular genre of self-help books. According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, identity, meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.
Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and caregivers. As well as featuring long-time members sharing experiences, these health groups can become lobby groups and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer support.

Neptune ([tpl]lang-la|Neptūnus[/tpl]) was the Roman god of freshwater and the seaJ. Toutain, Les cultes païens de l'Empire romain, vol. I (1905:378) securely identified Italic Neptune as a god of freshwater sources as well as the sea. in Roman religion. He is the counterpart of the Greek god Poseidon.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Neptune was the brother of Jupiter and Pluto, each of them presiding over the realms of Heaven, our earthly world, and the Underworld, respectively.[ref]About the relationship of the lord of our earthly world with water(s) Bloch, p. 342-346, gives the following explanations:
1. Poseidon is originally conceived as a chtonic god, lord and husband of the Earth ( for the etymology, epithtes γαιήοχος, he who possesses the Earth, εννοσίδας he who makes the Earth quake) with an equine form. He mates with Demeter under this  form in the Arcadian myth from Thelpusa, they beget the racing horse Areion and the unnamed daughter of those mysteries (story in Pausanias VIII 25, 3).
2. Poseidon hippios (horse) is the god of Earth and as springs come from beneath the earth, this is also a metaphora (or better a figure) of the origin of life on Earth;  the horse is universally considered as having a psychopompous character and Poseidon is known as tamer of  horses (damaios) and father of Pegasus who with its hoof can open up a spring..
3. Poseidon is the god worshipped in the main temple of the Isle of Atlantis in the myth narrated by Plato in the dialogues Timaeus and Critias; there was also a hippodrome nearby.
4. The island was swallowed up by an earthquake caused by Poseidon himself. This factor would connect the power over earth and that over waters. The Greek had a memory of the explosion of the Island of Santorini and of the seaquake it provoked as well as other consequences affecting climate.[/ref]  Salacia was his consort.
Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics, especially those of North Africa, are influenced by Hellenistic conventions.Alain Cadotte, "Neptune Africain", Phoenix 56.3/4 (Autumn/Winter 2002:330-347) detected syncretic traces of a Lybian/Punic agrarian god of fresh water sources, with the epithet Frugifer, "fruit-bearer"; Cadotte enumerated (p.332) some north African Roman mosaics of the fully characteristic Triumph of Neptune, whether riding in his chariot or mounted directly on albino dolphins. Neptune was likely associated with fresh water springs before the sea.Dumézil, La religion romaine archaïque  (Paris, 1966:381). Like Poseidon, Neptune was worshipped by the Romans also as a god of horses, under the name Neptunus Equester'', a patron of horse-racing.Compare Epona.

A tough administrator, his time in office saw the continued double-digit growth of the Chinese economy and China's increased assertiveness in international affairs. Known to be engaged in a testy relationship with General Secretary Jiang Zemin, under whom he served, Zhu provided a novel pragmatism and strong work ethic in the government and party leadership increasingly infested by corruption, and as a result gained great popularity with the Chinese public. His opponents, however, charge that Zhu's tough and pragmatic stance on policy was unrealistic and unnecessary, and many of his promises were left unfulfilled. Zhu retired in 2003, and has not been a public figure since. Premier Zhu was also widely known for his charisma and tasteful humour.

[[Nonlinear system]]
CATEGORIES: Nonlinear systems, Dynamical systems, Concepts in physics

In physics and other sciences, a nonlinear system, in contrast to a linear system, is a system which does not satisfy the superposition principle – meaning that the output of a nonlinear system is not directly proportional to the input. 
In mathematics, a nonlinear system of equations is a set of simultaneous equations in which the unknowns (or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one. 
In other words, in a nonlinear system of equations, the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in it (them). It does not matter if nonlinear known functions appear in the equations. In particular, a differential equation is linear if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it.
Typically, the behavior of a nonlinear system is described by a nonlinear system of equations.
Nonlinear problems are of interest to engineers, physicists and mathematicians and many other scientists because most systems are inherently nonlinear in nature. As nonlinear equations are difficult to solve, nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations (linearization). This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values, but some interesting phenomena such as chaosNonlinear Dynamics I: Chaos at MIT's OpenCourseWare and singularities are hidden by linearization. It follows that some aspects of the behavior of a nonlinear system appear commonly to be chaotic, unpredictable or counterintuitive. Although such chaotic behavior may resemble random behavior, it is absolutely not random. 
For example, some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout. This nonlinearity is one of the reasons why accurate long-term forecasts are impossible with current technology.

The Lycian Way is a long-distance footpath in Turkey around part of the coast of ancient Lycia. It is approximately 510 km long and stretches from Ölüdeniz, near Fethiye, to Hisarcandir, about 20 kilometers from Antalya.  It is waymarked with red and white stripes, the Grande Randonnee convention.
The Sunday Times has listed it as one of the world's top ten walks.
It takes its name from the ancient civilisation, which once ruled the area. The route is graded medium to hard; it is not level walking, but has many ascents and descents as it approaches and veers away from the sea. It is easier at the start near Fethiye and gets more difficult as it progresses. It is recommended that you walk the route in spring or autumn; February–May or September–November. Summer in Lycia is hot, although you could walk short, shady sections. The route is mainly over footpaths and mule trails; mostly limestone and often hard and stony underfoot.

James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich (c.1525 - 1583) was a Scottish legal writer, judge and politician.
The son of Sir Michael Balfour of Montquhanny, he was educated for the legal branch of the Church of Scotland. In June 1547, together with John Knox and others captured at St Andrews, Fife, following the capture of the castle by pro-Catholic French forces he was condemned to become a galley-slave rowing French galleys, but was released in 1549.  He denounced Protestantism and entered the service of Mary of Guise, and was rewarded with important legal appointments. 
He subsequently joined the Lords of the Congregation, a group of Protestant nobles who were against the marriage of the young, Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Dauphin of France (later to become Francois II of France), but betrayed their plans.
After Mary's arrival in Scotland he became one of her secretaries, in 1565 being reported as her greatest favourite after Rizzio. He obtained the parsonage of Flisk in Fife in 1561, was nominated an Extraordinary Lord of Session, and in 1563 one of the commissaries of the court which now took the place of the former ecclesiastical tribunal; in 1565 he was made a privy councillor, and in 1566 Lord Clerk Register, and was knighted. 
According to Mary his murder was intended together with Rizzio's in 1566. An adherent of Bothwell, he was deeply implicated in Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley's murder, though not present at the commission of the crime. By his means Darnley was lodged at Kirk o' Field, his brothers' house. He was supposed to have drawn up the bond at Craigmillar for the murder; he signed it, was made under Bothwell deputy-governor of Edinburgh Castle, and is said to have drawn up the marriage-contract between Bothwell and Mary. When, however, the fall of Bothwell was seen to be impending he rapidly changed sides and surrendered the castle to Murray, stipulating for his pardon for Darnley's murder, the retention of the priory of Pittenweem, and pecuniary rewards. He was appointed Lord President of the Court of Session on resigning the office of Lord Clerk Register. He was present at the battle of Langside, and was accused of having advised Mary to leave Dunbar to her ruin, and of having betrayed to her enemies the casket letters. The same year, however, in consequence of renewed intrigues with Mary's faction, he was dismissed, and next year was imprisoned on the charge of complicity in Darnley's murder. 
He succeeded in effecting his escape by means of bribery, the expenses of which he is said to have paid by intercepting the money sent from France to Mary's aid. In August 1571, during the regency of Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, an act of forfeiture was passed against him, but next year he was again playing traitor and discovering the secrets of his party to Morton, and he obtained a pardon from the latter in 1573 and negotiated the pacification of Perth the same year. Distrusted by all parties, he fled to France, where he seems to have remained till 1580. In 1579 his forfeiture was renewed by act of parliament. In January 1580 he wrote to Mary offering her his services, and in June made a similar offer to Queen Elizabeth I of England, in which he criticised the influence of the Jesuits, and proposed to make a journey to Dieppe to attend Protestant services. 
On 27 December the same year he returned to Scotland and effected the downfall and execution of Morton by producing a bond, probably that in defence of Bothwell and to promote his marriage with Mary, and giving evidence of the latter's knowledge of Bothwell's intention to murder Darnley. In July 1581 his cause was reheard; he was acquitted of murder by assize, and shortly afterwards in 1581 or 1582 he was restored to his estates and received at court. His career, one of the blackest in the annals of political perfidy and crime, closed shortly before 24 January 1584. He was the greatest lawyer of his day, and part-author at least of Balfour's Practicks, the earliest text-book of Scottish law, not published, however, till 1754. He married Margaret, daughter and heir of Michael Balfour of Burleigh, by whom, besides three daughters, he had six sons, the eldest of whom was created Lord Balfour of Burleigh in 1607.
He wrote a major work on Scots law, called Practicks. This was completed about 1579 and was widely circulated in manuscript copies. It was published in 1754, and republished in 1962: Peter G B McNeil (ed), The Practicks of Sir James Balfour of Pittendreich (1962, Stair Society).

[[Transport layer]]

CATEGORIES: Internet protocols, Transport layer protocols, OSI protocols

In computer networking, a transport layer provides end-to-end or host-to-host communication services for applications within a layered architecture of network components and protocols.RFC 1122, §1.1.3. The transport layer provides services such as connection-oriented data stream support, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.
Transport layer implementations are contained in both the TCP/IP model (RFC 1122),RFC 1122, Requirements for Internet Hosts – Communication Layers, IETF, R. Braden (Editor), October 1989 which is the foundation of the Internet, and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of general networking, however, the definitions of details of the transport layer are different in these models. In the  Open Systems Interconnection model the transport layer is most often referred to as Layer 4.
The best-known transport protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It lent its name to the title of the entire Internet Protocol Suite, TCP/IP. It is used for connection-oriented transmissions, whereas the connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used for simpler messaging transmissions. TCP is the more complex protocol, due to its stateful design incorporating reliable transmission and data stream services.  Other prominent protocols in this group are the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

[[Overburden pressure]]
CATEGORIES: Geophysics, Soil mechanics

[tpl]Unreferenced|date=May 2009[/tpl]Overburden pressure, also called lithostatic pressure, confining pressure or vertical stress, is the pressure or stress imposed on a layer of soil or rock by the weight of overlying material.
The overburden pressure at a depth z is given by
where ρ(z) is the density of the overlying rock at depth z and g is the acceleration due to gravity.  p0 is the datum pressure, like the pressure at the surface.
It may be noted that the above equation implies that gravitational acceleration is a constant over z since it is placed outside of the integral.  Strictly speaking, for almost all boundary conditions, g should appear inside the integrand since g is a function of the distance from mass.  However, since g varies little over depths which are a very small fraction of the Earth's radius, it is placed outside of the integral in practice for most near-surface applications which require an assessment of lithostatic pressure.  In deep-earth geophysics/geodynamics, gravitational acceleration varies significantly over depth, demanding that g be taken, at least, as a function of depth.

Sugar Ray Robinson (born Walker Smith Jr.; May 3, 1921 – April 12, 1989) was an American professional boxer. Frequently cited as the greatest boxer of all time, Robinson's performances in the welterweight and middleweight divisions prompted sportswriters to create "pound for pound" rankings, where they compared fighters regardless of weight. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.
Robinson was 85–0 as an amateur with 69 of those victories coming by way of knockout, 40 in the first round. He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a professional record of 128–1–2 with 84 knockouts.

He retired in 1952, only to come back two and a half years later and regain the middleweight title in 1955. He then became the first boxer in history to win a divisional world championship five times, a feat he accomplished by defeating Carmen Basilio in 1958 to regain the middleweight championship. Robinson was named "fighter of the year" twice: first for his performances in 1942, then nine years and over 90 fights later, for his efforts in 1951.
Renowned for his flamboyant lifestyle outside the ring, Robinson is credited with being the originator of the modern sports "entourage".

This Hour Has 22 Minutes (almost always referred to since fall 2009 as simply 22 Minutes; the full title is still seen briefly in the show's current introduction) is a weekly Canadian television comedy that airs on CBC Television. Launched in 1993 during Canada's 35th general election, the show focuses on Canadian politics, combining news parody, sketch comedy and satirical editorials. Originally featuring Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh, the series featured satirical sketches of the weekly news and Canadian political events. The show's format is a mock news program, intercut with comic sketches, parody commercials and humorous interviews of public figures. The on-location segments are frequently filmed with slanted camera angles.
Its full name is a parody of This Hour Has Seven Days, a CBC newsmagazine from the 1960s; the "22 Minutes" refers to the fact that a half-hour television program in Canada and the U.S. is typically 22 minutes long with eight minutes of commercials.
Jones and Walsh had previously worked together on the sketch comedy series CODCO, on which Thomey sometimes appeared as a guest. Mercer had been a notable young writer and performer on his own, touring several successful one-man shows of comedic political commentary.
Salter Street Films produced the series until the 2003–2004 season. Salter Street was acquired in 2001 by Alliance Atlantis, and production of the series was transferred directly to Alliance Atlantis in the twelfth season. Since 2005, Halifax Film, a new company formed by Salter co-founder Michael Donovan, has produced the show.
Recognized with 24 Gemini Awards and 11 Canadian Comedy Awards, 22 Minutes is broadcast on the CBC Television network. It is taped before a live audience in Studio 1 at CBHT in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
The series, which originally aired on Mondays for several seasons and later on Fridays, currently airs Tuesdays at 8:30pm on CBC, after the Rick Mercer Report.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American science fiction film written and directed by Steven Spielberg and features actors Richard Dreyfuss, François Truffaut, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, and Cary Guffey. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).
Close Encounters was a long-cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from ufologist J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with aliens, in which the third kind denotes human observations of actual aliens or "animate beings". Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the aliens.
Made on a production budget of $18 million, Close Encounters was released in November 1977 to critical and financial success, eventually grossing over $337,700,000 worldwide.
The film was reissued in 1980 as Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition, which featured additional scenes. A third cut of the film was released to home video and laserdisc in 1998 (and later DVD and Blu-ray). The film received numerous awards and nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, 32nd British Academy Film Awards, the 35th Golden Globe Awards, the Saturn Awards and has been widely acclaimed by the American Film Institute. In December 2007, it was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.[tpl]cite press release | title = Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007 | publisher = Library of Congress | date = December 27, 2007 | url = http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-254.html [/tpl]

It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts.
The osprey tolerates a wide variety of habitats, nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply. It is found on all continents except Antarctica, although in South America it occurs only as a non-breeding migrant.
As its other common name suggests, the osprey's diet consists almost exclusively of fish. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching prey. As a result of these unique characteristics, it has been given its own taxonomic genus, Pandion and family, Pandionidae. Four subspecies are usually recognized, one of which has recently been given full species status (see below). Despite its propensity to nest near water, the osprey is not classed as a sea-eagle.

[[Carbon-14]]

CATEGORIES: Isotopes of carbon, Environmental isotopes

Carbon-14, 14C, or radiocarbon, is a radioactive isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Its presence in organic materials is the basis of the radiocarbon dating method pioneered by Willard Libby and colleagues (1949) to date archaeological, geological and hydrogeological samples.  Carbon-14 was discovered on 27 February 1940, by Martin Kamen and Sam Ruben at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley.  Its existence had been suggested by Franz Kurie in 1934.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kamen|first=Martin D.|year=1963|title=Early History of Carbon-14: Discovery of this supremely important tracer was expected in the physical sense but not in the chemical sense|journal=Science|volume=140| issue=3567|pages=584–590|doi=10.1126/science.140.3567.584|url=|accessdate=|pmid=17737092|bibcode = 1963Sci...140..584K [/tpl] 
There are three naturally occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth: 99% of the carbon is carbon-12, 1% is carbon-13, and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts, i.e., making up about 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%) of the carbon in the atmosphere. The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years.[tpl]cite journal|last=Godwin|first=H|year=1962|title=Half-life of radiocarbon|journal=Nature|volume=195|issue=4845|page=984|doi=10.1038/195984a0|bibcode = 1962Natur.195..984G [/tpl] Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070705182336/http://www.nosams.whoi.edu/about/carbon_dating.html|title=What is carbon dating?|publisher=National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility|accessdate=2007-06-11[/tpl] 
The primary natural source of carbon-14 on Earth is cosmic ray action upon nitrogen in the atmosphere, and it is therefore a cosmogenic nuclide. However, open-air nuclear testing between 1955–1980 contributed to this pool. 
The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties. This is used in chemical and biological research, in a technique called carbon labeling: carbon-14 atoms can be used to replace nonradioactive carbon, in order to trace chemical and biochemical reactions involving carbon atoms from any given organic compound.

[[Shock wave]]

CATEGORIES: Shock waves

A shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance.  Like an ordinary wave, it carries energy and can propagate through a medium (solid, liquid, gas or plasma) or in some cases in the absence of a material medium, through a field such as the electromagnetic field. Shock waves are characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous change in the characteristics of the medium.[ref]
</ref> Across a shock there is always an extremely rapid rise in [[pressure]], [[temperature]] and [[density]] of the flow. In supersonic flows, expansion is achieved through an [[expansion fan]]. A shock wave travels through most media at a higher speed than an ordinary wave.
Unlike solitons (another kind of nonlinear wave), the energy of a shock wave dissipates relatively quickly with distance. Also, the accompanying expansion wave approaches and eventually merges with the shock wave, partially cancelling it out. Thus the sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is the sound wave resulting from the degradation and merging of the shock wave and the expansion wave produced by the aircraft.
When a shock wave passes through matter, the total energy is preserved but the energy which can be extracted as work decreases and the entropy increases. This, for example, creates additional drag force on aircraft with shocks.

Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), was a significant United States Supreme Court case dealing with the planned desegregation busing of public school students across district lines among 53 school districts in metropolitan Detroit. It concerned the plans to integrate public schools in the United States in the aftermath of the Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) decision. 
The ruling clarified the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation, confirming that segregation was allowed if it was not considered an explicit policy of the school district. In particular, the Court held that the school systems were not responsible for desegregation across district lines unless it could be shown that they had deliberately engaged in a policy of segregation. The case did not expand on Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), the first major Supreme Court case concerning school busing.

The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|t|ər|ˈ|d|eɪ|m[/tpl] [tpl]respell|NOH|tər|DAYM|'[/tpl]) is a Catholic research university located near South Bend, Indiana, in the United States. In French, Notre Dame du Lac means "Our Lady of the Lake" and refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary.
The school was founded by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president. Today, many Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including as its president. It was established as an all-male institution on November 26, 1842, on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes. The university first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972.

McCulloch v. Maryland, [tpl]ussc|17|316|1819[/tpl], was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. The state of Maryland had attempted to impede operation of a branch of the Second Bank of the United States by imposing a tax on all notes of banks not chartered in Maryland. Though the law, by its language, was generally applicable to all banks not chartered in Maryland, the Second Bank of the United States was the only out-of-state bank then existing in Maryland, and the law was recognized in the court's opinion as having specifically targeted the U.S. Bank. The Court invoked the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, which allowed the Federal government to pass laws not expressly provided for in the Constitution's list of express powers, provided those laws are in useful furtherance of the express powers of Congress under the Constitution.
This case established two important principles in constitutional law. First, the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution's express powers, in order to create a functional national government. Second, state action may not impede valid constitutional exercises of power by the Federal government.

The Supreme Court upheld the sanctity of the original charter of the college, which pre-dated the creation of the State.
The decision settled the nature of public versus private charters and resulted in the rise of the American business corporation and the free American enterprise system.[tpl]Cite book |last=Newmyer |first=R.

[[Cohens v. Virginia]]

CATEGORIES: United States Supreme Court cases, 1821 in United States case law, United States Eleventh Amendment case law, Supremacy Clause case law, Criminal cases in the Marshall Court

Cohens v. Virginia, [tpl]ussc|19|264|1821[/tpl], was a United States Supreme Court decision most noted for the Court's assertion of its power to review state supreme court decisions in criminal law matters when the defendant claims that their Constitutional rights have been violated. The Court had previously asserted a similar jurisdiction over civil cases involving American parties. 
An act of the United States Congress authorized the operation of a lottery in the District of Columbia. The Cohen brothers proceeded to sell D.C. lottery tickets in the Commonwealth of Virginia, violating state law. State authorities tried and convicted the Cohens and fined them $100. The state courts found that Virginia law prohibiting lotteries could be enforced, notwithstanding the act of Congress which authorized the D.C. lottery. The Cohens appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that their conduct was protected by the Act of Congress authorizing the D.C. lottery.
The main issue in the case was the preliminary issue of whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal in a criminal case decided by the courts of the state of Virginia. It was argued by Virginia that the Constitution does not give the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over criminal judgments by the state courts. Virginia also argued that the Constitution does not give the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over cases in which a state is a party. In effect, Virginia argued that its decision was final and unreviewable by the federal courts, even though the decision involved the interpretation and application of an act of Congress. Virginia thereby asserted that it had an unreviewable right to interpret and apply (or not apply) federal law as it saw fit.
The Supreme Court relied on Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which provides that the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction in "all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority." The Court found that the Constitution provides no exceptions to this grant of jurisdiction for cases arising in the state courts or for cases in which a state is a party. Therefore, under the language of the Constitution, all cases arising under federal law are within the Constitution's grant of appellate jurisdiction. This conclusion was reinforced, said the Court, by the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which makes federal law superior to state law.
The Court stated that if state court decisions involving federal law were unreviewable by the federal courts, then each state could prevent the federal government from executing federal laws within that state, giving each state veto power over federal law. The Court found that this was not consistent with the language and intent of the Constitution, including the explicit grant of judicial power to the federal courts. The Court stated: "There is certainly nothing in the circumstances under which our Constitution was formed, nothing in the history of the times, which would justify the opinion that the confidence reposed in the States was so implicit as to leave in them and their tribunals the power of resisting or defeating, in the form of law, the legitimate measures of the Union." Therefore, the Court said, the framers of the Constitution did "confer on the judicial department the power of construing the Constitution and laws of the Union in every case, in the last resort, and of preserving them from all violation from every quarter, so far as judicial decisions can preserve them." 
The Court also said that if state court decisions involving federal law were unreviewable by federal courts, then there would be as many interpretations of federal law as there are states. Quoting The Federalist No. 80, the Court found that the Constitution was not intended to create "a hydra in government from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed." Rather, relying on The Federalist No. 82, the Court found that the framers intended for the Supreme Court to have appellate jurisdiction over state court cases involving federal law.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court found that there should be no restriction or limitation on the Constitution's plain language granting it appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States. The Court therefore had jurisdiction over the appeal from the Virginia courts.
Having found that it had jurisdiction, the Supreme Court upheld the Cohens' convictions. The Court found that Congress did not intend to authorize the sale of lottery tickets outside of the District of Columbia. Therefore, there was no conflict between the act of Congress authorizing a lottery in D.C. and Virginia's statute prohibiting lotteries in Virginia.

Rehnquist, All the Laws But One (New York: Knopf, 1998), 27–39. Chief Justice Roger Taney, sitting as a federal circuit court judge, ruled that the authority to suspend habeas corpus lay with Congress, not the president. President Lincoln ignored the ruling, as did the Army under Lincoln's orders. The case was rendered moot by Lincoln's subsequent order in February 1862 to release almost everyone held as a political prisoner.Amnesty to Political or State Prisoners.

[[Medical emergency]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency medicine, Medical emergencies

A medical emergency is an injury or illness that is acute and poses an immediate risk to a person's life or long term health. These emergencies may require assistance from another person, who should ideally be suitably qualified to do so, although some of these emergencies can be dealt with by the victim themselves. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Dependent on the severity of the emergency, and the quality of any treatment given, it may require the involvement of multiple levels of care, from first aiders to Emergency Medical Technicians and emergency physicians.
Any response to an emergency medical situation will depend strongly on the situation, the patient involved and availability of resources to help them. It will also vary depending on whether the emergency occurs whilst in hospital under medical care, or outside of medical care (for instance, in the street or alone at home).

[[Firefighter]]
CATEGORIES: Firefighters, Protective service occupations

A firefighter, also known as a fireman, is a rescuer extensively trained in firefighting, primarily to extinguish hazardous fires that threaten property and civilian or natural populations and to rescue people from dangerous situations, like collapsed or burning buildings.
The complexity of modern industrialized life with a greater prominence of hazards has created an increase in the skills needed in firefighting technology and a broadening of the firefighter-rescuer's remit. They sometimes provide emergency medical services, for example. The fire service, or fire and rescue service, also known in some countries as the fire brigade or fire department, is one of the main emergency services. Firefighting and firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world, from wildland areas to urban areas, and aboard ships. According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, the English word "firefighter" has been used since 1903.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/firefighter |title="firefighter" Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-12-10[/tpl] In recent decades it has become the preferred term, replacing the older "fireman", since many women serve as firefighters, and also because the term "fireman" can have other meanings, including someone who sets, stokes, or tends fires - especially in designated fireplaces – the opposite of the firefighting role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_9_8.html |title=America on the Move: Locomotive Engineer & Fireman |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2012-12-10[/tpl]
In many countries, firefighters may be employed as full-time workers and paid a salary. Additionally, there are volunteer firefighters (who are theoretically unpaid) and retained firefighters (or auxiliary firefighters, who are paid for the specific time they are on duty, i.e. permanent part-time career firefighters) on call as required.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nswfb.nsw.gov.au/page.php?id=11 |title=Retained Firefighters |publisher= Fire and Rescue NSW |date= September 17, 2011|accessdate= [/tpl] In such countries as the United Kingdom, the use of additional retained firefighters is standard. In Portugal, for example, the use of volunteer firefighters is standard, along with career firefighters. In Australia there are volunteer brigades which are mostly unpaid rural services, although traditionally they are paid by their employers if called out during usual working hours.

[[Shock (circulatory)]]
CATEGORIES: Intensive care medicine, Medical emergencies, Causes of death

Circulatory shock, commonly known simply as shock, is a life-threatening medical condition that occurs due to inadequate substrate for aerobic cellular respiration. In the early stages this is generally an inadequate tissue level of oxygen.[tpl]cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=165–172|isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
The typical signs of shock are low blood pressure, a rapid heartbeat and signs of poor end-organ perfusion or "decompensation/peripheral shut down" (such as low urine output, confusion or loss of consciousness). There are times that a person's blood pressure may remain stable, but may still be in circulatory shock, so it is not always a sign.[tpl]cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |pages=278–288  |chapter=Chapter 24: Circulatory Shock and Physiology of Its Treatment[/tpl]
Circulatory shock is not related to the emotional state of shock. Circulatory shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and one of the most common causes of death for critically ill people. Shock can have a variety of effects, all with similar outcomes, but all relate to a problem with the body's circulatory system. For example, shock may lead to hypoxemia (a lack of oxygen in arterial blood) or cardiac arrest.[tpl]cite book |last = Marino |first = Paul L. |title = The ICU Book  |url = http://www.lww.com/product/?978-0-7817-4802-5 |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia & London |date=September 2006 |isbn = 0-7817-4802-X[/tpl]
One of the key dangers of shock is that it progresses by a positive feedback mechanism. Once shock begins, it tends to make itself worse, so immediate treatment of shock is critical to the survival of the sufferer.

[[Ambulance]]
CATEGORIES: Ambulances, Medical technology

An ambulance is a vehicle for transportation of sick or injured people to, from or between places of treatment for an illness or injury,Skinner, Henry Alan. 1949, "The Origin of Medical Terms". Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins and in some instances will also provide out of hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road going emergency ambulances which form part of an emergency medical service, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems.
The term ambulance does, however, extend to a wider range of vehicles other than those with flashing warning lights and sirens. The term also includes a large number of non-urgent ambulances which are for transport of patients without an urgent acute condition (see below: Functional types) and a wide range of urgent and non-urgent vehicles including trucks, vans, bicycles, motorbikes, station wagons, buses, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, boats, and even hospital ships (see below: Vehicle types).
The term ambulance comes from the Latin word "ambulare" as meaning to walk or move about[tpl]cite web|url=http://science.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/ambulance|title=How Products Are Made: Ambulance|publisher=How products are made|accessdate=2 June 2007[/tpl] which is a reference to early medical care where patients were moved by lifting or wheeling. The word originally meant a moving hospital, which follows an army in its movements.Oxford English Dictionary ambulance definition 1 During the American Civil War vehicles for conveying the wounded off the field of battle were called ambulance wagons.Civil War Ambulance Wagons Field hospitals were still called ambulances during the Franco-Prussian WarThe memoirs of Charles E. Ryan With An Ambulance Personal Experiences And Adventures With Both Armies 1870–1871 http://www.ourstory.info/library/1-roots/Ryan/ambTC.html#TC and of Emma Maria Pearson and Louisa McLaughlin Our Adventures During the War of 1870 http://www.ukchnm.org/uploads/file/ouradventures.pdf of 1870 and in the Serbo-Turkish war of 1876Emma Maria Pearson and Louisa McLaughlin Service in Servia Under the Red Cross http://www.ukchnm.org/uploads/file/serviceinservia.pdf even though the wagons were first referred to as ambulances about 1854 during the Crimean War.Oxford English Dictionary ambulance definition 2a
There are other types of ambulance, with the most common being the patient transport ambulance (sometimes called an ambulette). These vehicles are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment, and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances. Their purpose is simply to transport patients to, from or between places of treatment. In most countries, these are not equipped with flashing lights or sirens. In some jurisdictions there is a modified form of the ambulance used, that only carries one member of ambulance crew to the scene to provide care, but is not used to transport the patient.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carpages.co.uk/honda/honda_essex_ambulance_chooses_honda_power_24_07_04.asp|title=Essex Ambulance Response Cars|publisher=Car Pages|date=24 July 2004|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] Such vehicles are called fly-cars. In these cases a patient who requires transportation to hospital will require a patient-carrying ambulance to attend in addition to the fast responder.

The law of war is a legal term of art that refers to the aspect of public international law concerning acceptable justifications to engage in war (jus ad bellum) and the limits to acceptable wartime conduct (jus in bello or International humanitarian law).
Among other issues, modern laws of war address declarations of war, acceptance of surrender and the treatment of prisoners of war; military necessity, along with distinction and proportionality; and the prohibition of certain weapons that may cause unnecessary suffering.The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University, "IHL PRIMER SERIES | Issue #1" Accessed at http://www3.nd.edu/~cpence/eewt/IHLRI2009.pdf
The law of war is considered distinct from other bodies of law—such as the domestic law of a particular belligerent to a conflict—that may also provide legal limits to the conduct or justification of war.

[[Birmingham Dribbler]]

CATEGORIES: Miniature railways, Rail transport modelling, Steam power

Birmingham Dribbler or carpet railway describes a type of very early model railway.Birmingham Dribblers at antiques-bible.com It is a bit of a misnomer, as the railway featured a model live steam railway locomotive, but no track – the locomotive was simply run across the floor. In some cases, the front wheels were even made steerable so that they could be run in a circle without track. They first appeared in the 1840s and became very popular Victorian model railway toys.
The steam locomotives were very simple, usually made in brass, with a pair of simple oscillating cylinders driving the main wheels. They were basically a boiler mounted on wheels, although simple decoration (usually bands of lacquer) was sometimes applied.  Track was not used – the boiler was filled with water, the burner lit, and when steam was being produced, the locomotive was placed on the floor and allowed to run until either the water or fuel ran out or the engine crashed into the furniture.  Very quickly, after a number had exploded, simple safety valves were fitted.
They quickly gained the nickname of Birmingham Dribblers (or sometimes "Piddlers"), as large numbers of them were made in Birmingham, England, and they had the unfortunate habit of leaving a trail of water behind them as they ran across the floor.  Very often this trail would be mixed with the fuel used for the burner, and there were numerous incidents of fires caused by the locomotive crashing into furniture and over-turning so that the burning fuel was spilled over the floor. The fuel inside has also been known to explode [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl], but this is incredibly rare. As time passed, embellishments were added, such as wooden buffer beams, buffers and steam whistles.

Emergency services and rescue serviceshttp://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/rescue-services are organizations which ensure public safety and health by addressing different emergencies. Some of these agencies exist solely for addressing certain types of emergencies whilst others deal with ad hoc emergencies as part of their normal responsibilities.  Many of these agencies engage in community awareness and prevention programs to help the public avoid, detect, and report emergencies effectively.
The availability of emergency services depends very heavily on location, and may in some cases also rely on the recipient giving payment or holding suitable insurance or other surety for receiving the service.

An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or environment.[tpl]cite web|title=UK Government Advice on Definition of an Emergency|url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf|accessdate=2007-05-30|format=PDF[/tpl]  Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.
While some emergencies are self-evident (such as a natural disaster that threatens many lives), many smaller incidents require that an observer (or affected party) decide whether it qualifies as an emergency.
The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and management.

[[Enhanced 9-1-1]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency telephone numbers, North American Numbering Plan, Geolocation

Enhanced 911, E-911 or E911 is a system used in North America that links emergency callers with the appropriate public resources. Three-digit emergency telephone numbers originated in the United Kingdom in 1937 and have spread to continents and countries across the globe. Other easy dial codes, including the 112 number adopted by the European Union in 1991, have been deployed to provide free-of-charge emergency calls.
In North America, where 9-1-1 was chosen as the easy access code, the system tries to automatically associate a location with the origin of the call. This location may be a physical address or other geographic reference information such as X/Y map coordinates. The caller's telephone number is used in various ways to derive a location that can be used to dispatch police, fire, emergency medical and other response resources. Automatic location of the emergency makes it quicker to locate the required resources during fires, break-ins, kidnappings, and other events where communicating one's location is difficult or impossible.
In North America the incoming 9-1-1 call is typically answered at the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) of the governmental agency that has jurisdiction over the caller's location (see #Location below). When the 9-1-1 call arrives at the appropriate PSAP, it is answered by a specially trained official known as a Telecommunicator. In some jurisdictions the Telecommunicator is also the dispatcher of public safety response resources. When the call arrives at the PSAP, special computer software is used to display the location of the caller immediately upon arrival of the call.
The system only works in North America if the emergency telephone number 911 is called.  Calls made to other telephone numbers, even though they may be listed as an emergency telephone number, may not enable this feature.  Outside Canada and the United States this type of facility is often called caller location, though its implementation is dependent on how the telephone network processes emergency calls.

The FBU demanded a 39 percent increase in pay, which would have brought the average firefighter's wage to around £30,000. It balloted its members for a strike in late 2002 and the industrial action began in November.

A fire apparatus (also known in some territories as a fire engine, fire truck, or fire appliance) is a vehicle designed to assist in firefighting and other rescue operations. Its functions include transporting firefighters to the scene of a fire, along with water and other equipment. In some territories, the terms fire engine and fire truck may represent different types of fire apparatus.
A typical modern fire apparatus carries equipment for a wide range of firefighting and rescue tasks. These include ladders, pike poles, axes and cutting equipment, halligan bars, ventilating equipment, floodlights, hose ramps, self-contained breathing apparatus, and general tools. 
Many fire apparatus are based on standard truck or lorry models with heavy duty suspension, alternators, transmission and cooling systems; audible and visual warnings such as sirens, horns, and flashing lights are added, as well as communication equipment such as a two-way radio.
Fire aparatus are often adapted to their areas of operation. Fire departments covering metropolitan areas or regions with additional fire risks may operate additional specialist vehicles for dealing with hazardous material incidents, fires requiring major foam attacks and multiple hose laying, as well as urban search and rescue and water rescues. In rural areas, fire departments may operate all-terrain apparatus. Depending on the local geography, fire-trains, fireboats or airplanes may also be used. In addition to apparatus designed specifically to fight fire, many fire departments also operate rescue units that carry tools for technical rescues of people from traffic collisions or structural collapses.

[[Bomb threat]]

CATEGORIES: Crimes, Emergency services, Illegal speech, Terrorism tactics, Civil defense

A bomb threat is generally defined as a threat, usually verbal or written, to detonate an explosive or incendiary device to cause property damage, death, or injuries, whether or not such a device actually exists. 
Criminal statutes typically dictate severe penalties. For example, the American state of Massachusetts provides for penalties of up to 20 years in prison, up to $50,000 fine, and restitution for the costs of the disruption.M.G.L. - Chapter 269, Section 14 New York law makes it an "E Felony ... to issue a false bomb threat directed toward a school in New York State."Press release, New York State Education Department, "School Bomb Threats Are A Felony," found at School Bomb Threats Are A Felony from NYSED Government website. Retrieved April 15, 2009.
Some statutory definitions include the threatened use, release or placement of other harmful agents, such as poisons, biological pathogens, radioactive materials, or even a dangerous weapon (e.g., aboard an airliner). Other statutes enhance the penalties for threats made against specific places or persons (e.g., government facilities or dignitaries), and the actual possession of harmful devices or agents.
Many bomb threats that are not pranks are made as parts of other crimes,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] such as extortion, aircraft hijacking, arson, robbery, or school attack. Actual bombings for malicious destruction of property, terrorism, or murder are often perpetrated without warnings.
The decision to evacuate an area or building, depending on the perceived reliability of the threat, may be made by local controlling authorities or those in charge of the targeted facility based on advice from bomb disposal experts. When a large facility is involved, it can be very difficult and time-consuming to ensure the absence of any bomb or other hazardous device or substance.
During the Northern Ireland conflict, paramilitary groups used pre-arranged code words when making bomb threats, to add authenticity to their claims of involvement. The codes would be updated regularly and provided to the police and the media.[tpl]cite web|last=Sengupta|first=Kim|title=Phone codes that prove bomb threats are real|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/phone-codes-that-prove-bomb-threats-are-real-1275833.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 May 2011|date=30 March 1997[/tpl]

[[Defibrillation]]

CATEGORIES: American inventions, Cardiac electrophysiology, Emergency medical procedures, Medical devices

Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the heart with a device called a defibrillator. This depolarizes a critical mass of the heart muscle, terminates the dysrhythmia and allows normal sinus rhythm to be reestablished by the body's natural pacemaker, in the sinoatrial node of the heart.
Defibrillators can be external, transvenous, or implanted, depending on the type of device used or needed. Some external units, known as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), automate the diagnosis of treatable rhythms, meaning that lay responders or bystanders are able to use them successfully with little or no training at all.

Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR)Emergency Response - Central Government Arrangements - cabinetoffice.gov.ukEmergencies: the legal and operational framework - cabinetoffice.gov.uk refers to the location for a type of crisis response committee set up to coordinate the actions of bodies within the government of the United Kingdom in response to instances of national or regional crisis, or during events abroad with major implications for the UK. The constitution of a COBR meeting depends on the nature of the incident but it is usually chaired by the Prime Minister or another senior minister, with other key ministers as appropriate, and representatives of relevant external organizations such as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Local Government Association.[tpl]cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/publicservices/story/0,11032,816220,00.html|title=What is Cobra|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 Sep 2009 | location=London | date=21 October 2002 | first=Joey | last=Gardiner[/tpl]
COBR meetings are generally held in one of the Cabinet Office buildings in Whitehall, London.

[[Artificial respiration]]

CATEGORIES: First aid

Artificial respiration is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body by pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration.[tpl]cite book|last=Tortora|first=Gerard J|author2=Derrickson, Bryan|title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.[/tpl]  Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for a person who is not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070614094502/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9009713/artificial-respiration| archivedate= 14 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] (although it must be used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to achieve the internal respiration).
Pulmonary anton ventilation (and hence external parts of respiration) is achieved through manual insufflation of the lungs either by the rescuer blowing into the patient's lungs, or by using a mechanical device to do so.  This method of insufflation has been proved more effective than methods which involve mechanical manipulation of the patient's chest or arms, such as the Silvester method.[tpl]cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562617/Artificial_Respiration.html|title=Artificial Respiration|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKiCVG5|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes[/tpl]   It is also known as Expired Air Resuscitation (EAR), Expired Air Ventilation (EAV), mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, rescue breathing or colloquially the kiss of life.
Artificial respiration is a part of most protocols for performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/cprleaflet|title=Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation model information leafler|publisher=British Medical Association|date=July 2002|accessdate=2007-06-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12|title=Overview of CPR|publisher=American Heart Association|year=2005|accessdate=2007-06-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070627015639/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-12| archivedate= 27 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] making it an essential skill for first aid.   In some situations, artificial respiration is also performed separately, for instance in near-drowning and opiate overdoses.  The performance of artificial respiration in its own is now limited in most protocols to health professionals, whereas lay first aiders are advised to undertake full CPR in any case where the patient is not breathing sufficiently.
Mechanical ventilation involves the use of a mechanical ventilator to move air in and out of the lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on their own, for example during surgery with general anesthesia or when an individual is in a coma.

[[Tracheal intubation]]
CATEGORIES: Anesthesia, Emergency medical procedures, First aid, Intensive care medicine, Medical equipment, Oral and maxillofacial surgery, Otolaryngology, Respiratory system procedures, Respiratory therapy, Medical treatments

Tracheal intubation, usually simply referred to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.
The most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal apparatus into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.
Because it is an invasive and extremely uncomfortable medical procedure, intubation is usually performed after administration of general anesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. It can however be performed in the awake patient with local or topical anesthesia, or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or video laryngoscope to identify the glottis, though other devices and techniques are available.
After the trachea has been intubated, a balloon cuff is typically inflated just above the far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator.
Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).
For centuries, tracheotomy was considered the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because only a minority of patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation to the point that it could be considered an acceptable treatment option.
Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, laryngology, pulmonology and surgery.
Tracheal intubation can be associated with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also be associated with potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.

The króna (plural krónur) (sign: kr; code: ISK) is the currency of Iceland. The króna was historically subdivided into 100 aurar (singular eyrir),"Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls" but this subdivision is no longer used.
The word króna, meaning "crown", is related to those of other Nordic currencies (such as the Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone) and to the Latin word corona ("crown").See Wiktionary: corona. The name "Icelandic crown" is sometimes used, for example in the financial markets. The word eyrir derives from Latin aura, gold, historically 100 gold pieces to a crown.

CATEGORIES: Economic planning, Economy of the Soviet Union, Soviet phraseology, Five-year plans

The Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union (USSR) (Russian: пятилетка, Pyatiletka, literally: "five year-er") were a series of nation-wide centralized economic plans in the Soviet Union. The plans were developed by a state planning committee based on the Theory of Productive Forces that was part of the general guidelines of the Communist Party for economic development. Fulfilling the plan became the watchword of Soviet bureaucracy (see Overview of the Soviet economic planning process).
The same method of planning was also adopted by most other communist states, including the People's Republic of China. In addition, several capitalist states have emulated the concept of central planning, though in the context of a market economy, by setting integrated economic goals for a finite period of time. Nazi Germany emulated the practice in its Four Year Plan designed to bring Germany to war-readiness.
Several Five-Year Plans did not take up the full period of time assigned to them: some were successfully completed earlier than expected, while others failed and were abandoned. Altogether, there were thirteen Five-Year Plans. The initial Five-Year Plans were created to serve in the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union and thus placed a major focus on heavy industry. The first one was accepted in 1928, for the period from 1929 to 1933, and completed one year early. The last Five-Year Plan was for the period from 1991 to 1995 and was not completed since the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991.

[[Whitehall]]
CATEGORIES: Areas of London, Streets in the City of Westminster, Government buildings in the United Kingdom

Whitehall is a road in the City of Westminster, in central London, which forms the first part of the A3212 road from Trafalgar Square to Chelsea. It is the main thoroughfare running south from the site of the original Charing Cross at the southern end of Trafalgar Square towards Parliament Square. Recognised as the centre of Her Majesty's Government, the street is lined with government departments and ministries; the name "Whitehall" is thus also frequently used as a metonym for overall British governmental administration, as well as being a geographic name for the surrounding area.
The name is taken from the vast Palace of Whitehall that used to occupy the area but which was largely destroyed by fire in 1698. Whitehall was originally a wide road that led to the front of the palace. Trafalgar Square was built at its northern extremity in the early 19th century. The southernmost portion between Parliament Square and Downing Street is named Parliament Street. Combined, Parliament Street and Whitehall cover a distance of about 0.6 mile (1 km).
Whitehall is also widely known for a number of memorial statues and monuments, including Britain's primary war memorial, the Cenotaph.

rsync is a utility software and network protocol for Unix-like systems (with a port to Microsoft Windows) that synchronizes files and directories from one location to another while minimizing data transfer by using delta encoding when appropriate. It also has the option to provide encrypted transfer by use of SSH. SSL encrypted transfer can be done via Stunnel wrapping. Quoting the official website: "rsync is a file transfer program for Unix systems. rsync uses the 'rsync algorithm' which provides a very fast method for bringing remote files into sync."rsync features, Retrieved 29 Jul. 2012. A feature of rsync not found in most similar programs/protocols[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] is that the mirroring takes place with only one transmission in each direction, eliminating the message latency overhead inherent in transmitting a large number of small messages.http://www.samba.org/~tridge/phd_thesis.pdf rsync can copy or display directory contents and copy files, optionally using compression and recursion.
For secure transfer, rsync can use SSH to encrypt data during the transfer using the "-e ssh" option.
From the man page: "For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh for its communications, but it may have been configured to use a different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh."
In daemon mode, rsync listens by default on TCP port 873, serving files in the native rsync protocol (using the "rsync://" syntax).
You can also implicitly start it through a remote shell such as RSH or SSHhttp://troy.jdmz.net/rsync/index.html (using the "user@host::" syntax. The "::" mode is not well described and not easy to use).
Of course, in both cases you need an rsync client executable installed on the local machine;
in the latter case, the client executable acts as a server.

The Burrell affair was a scandal in 2002 which arose from a number of allegations about the behaviour of the British Royal Family and their servants.  The scandal had constitutional implications for the United Kingdom, as the Queen is the head of state of a constitutional monarchy and is theoretically the embodiment of the state in all legal proceedings, and any involvement of a reigning monarch in a law court would be unprecedented.  The only trial of a reigning monarch was that of Charles I, which occurred during a state of outright civil war.
The theft trial of Paul Burrell, the butler of Diana, Princess of Wales, collapsed after evidence was given that Queen Elizabeth II had spoken with Burrell regarding the items he was accused of stealing. This seemed to provide support for his assertion that he was keeping Diana's possessions for safe-keeping with the consent of the British Royal Family, rather than stealing them. However, calling upon the Queen to give evidence might have triggered a constitutional crisis.  The Crown Prosecution Service then presented a Public Interest Immunity certificate in regard to the Queen's testimony.

[[Wheat mildew]]
CATEGORIES: Wheat diseases, Fungal plant pathogens and diseases

Wheat mildew is a wheat disease that affects the ear, and is brought on by causes somewhat similar to those that cause blight, though at a more advanced period of the season. If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected—but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible.  Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting. 
Another disorder that affects wheat, which several people consider the real rust, is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived. 
Some people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and inapable of withstanding winter blasts.

[[Opabinia]]

CATEGORIES: Dinocarida, Cambrian animals, Prehistoric invertebrates, Burgess Shale fossils, Incertae sedis

Opabinia is an extinct stem-arthropod genus found in Cambrian fossil deposits. The only known species, O. regalis, is known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia, Canada. Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described; 3 specimens of Opabinia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise less than 0.1% of the community.[tpl]cite doi|10.2110/palo.2003.P05-070R[/tpl] Opabinia was a soft-bodied animal of modest size, and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan-shaped tail. The head shows unusual features: five eyes, a mouth under the head and facing backwards, and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth. Opabinia probably lived on the seafloor, using the proboscis to seek out small, soft food.
When the first thorough examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features, it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably Anomalocaris, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.
In the 1970s there was an ongoing debate about whether multi-celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian, in an event called the Cambrian explosion, or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils. At first Opabinia was regarded as strong evidence for the "explosive" hypothesis. Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals, some with closer resemblances to arthropods, and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes.

The great famine of 1983–5 is often ascribed to drought, and while climatic causes and consequences certainly played a part in the tragedy, it has been shown that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was under way.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=4[/tpl] The famines that struck Ethiopia between 1961 and 1985, and in particular the one of 1983–5, were in large part created by government policies, specifically the set of counter-insurgency strategies employed and so-called 'social transformation' in non-insurgent areas.[tpl]sfn|de Waal|1991|p=4–6[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Young|2006|p=132[/tpl]

The main town and site of its municipal council was the town of Oksbøl.
Because Blåvandshuk is on the coast and has a peninsula (Skallingen) which stretches to the southeast, it is surrounded by much water.  To the northwest is the North Sea.  To the southeast of Skallingen is Fanø Bay (Fanø Bugt) where the island Fanø lies.  Beyond Fanø Bay is the Wadden Sea.  To the northeast of Skallingen lies Ho Bay (Ho Bugt) and the small island of Langli.
Skallingen and the waters off its coast are protected, a part of the Wadden Sea wildlife reserve and protection area being discussed as a potential national park.  Located on Skallingens southwestern coast is Denmark's last minefield, left over from Second World War, when 1,389,289 landmines were placed in Denmark by the German occupation forces as part of their defence line. Approximately 10,000 of these mines, two-thirds of which are anti-personnel mines, remain in a closed-off area on the peninsula. Demining efforts are hampered by the shifting sands that can bury mines several meters underground, and the drift of the sea which has moved the beach some 200 meters to the east since the end of the war. The field will be cleared out at the latest according to the Ottawa Convention in 2009.
A significant portion of Blåvandshuk is marsh land, moor, dunes, and beaches.
Blåvandshuk municipality ceased to exist due to Kommunalreformen ("The Municipal Reform" of 2007). It was merged with former Blaabjerg, Helle, Varde, and Ølgod municipalities to form a new Varde municipality.

[[Helle (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Women in Greek mythology

Helle ([tpl]lang-el|Ἕλλη[/tpl]) (sometimes also called Athamantis) was a character in Greek mythology who figured prominently in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Phrixus, son of Athamas and Nephele, along with his twin sister, Helle, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeetes placed in a consecrated grove, under the care of a sleepless dragon.
With the Greek god Poseidon she was the mother of the giant Almops and Paeon (called Edonus in some accounts).[tpl]cite book  | last = Bell  | first = Robert E.  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Women of Classical Mythology  | publisher = ABC-CLIO  | date = 1991  | location =   | pages = 230  | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=1KIYAAAAIAAJ  | isbn = 0-87436-581-3[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) | title = Paeon | editor = William Smith | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology | volume = 3 | pages = 83 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0003.001;q1=paeon;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=91[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Film sound production, Music production

A click track is a series of audio cues used to synchronize sound recordings, sometimes for synchronization to a moving image. The click track originated in early sound movies, where optical marks were made on the film to indicate precise timings for musical accompaniment.  It can also serve a purpose similar to a metronome, as in the music industry, where it is often used during recording sessions and live performances.Gavin Harrison (August 2003).

[[Scott Bradley]]

CATEGORIES: 1891 births, 1977 deaths, People from Pope County, Arkansas, American film score composers, Musicians from Arkansas

Scott Bradley (November 26, 1891 – April 27, 1977) was an American composer, pianist and conductor.
Bradley is best remembered for scoring the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) theatrical cartoons, including those starring Tom and Jerry (Hanna-Barbera 1940-1958, 113 of 114 episodes), Droopy (all 24 episodes), Barney Bear (all 26 episodes) and many one-off cartoons.
In an autobiographical sketch,Goldmark, Daniel (2005), "Tunes for 'Toons: Music and Hollywood Cartoons", University of California Press, p. 46. Bradley noted that he began his career performing with and later conducting theatre orchestras in Houston, Texas. He studied organ and harmony with Horton Corbett, the choir director of Houston's Christ Church Cathedral, but was "otherwise entirely self-taught in composition and orchestration." (Years later, when he was already established in Hollywood, he sought to improve his technique by studying privately with MGM colleague Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco).Goldmark, Daniel (2005), "Tunes for 'Toons: Music and Hollywood Cartoons", University of California Press, p. 49. In 1926, Bradley moved to Los Angeles to conduct programs over KHJ Radio, an activity that led to his growing involvement in animation at the start of the talkie era. He was a staff musician for Walt Disney (1929) and the Ub Iwerks studio (1930-1934), then became music director for Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, who were hired to produce cartoon shorts for MGM. After MGM established its own cartoon studio in 1937, Bradley was hired permanently and remained with the company for twenty years.
During the 1930s, Bradley also composed music for the concert hall, including the tone poems "The Valley of the White Poppies" (1931) and "The Headless Horseman" (1932) and the oratorio "Thanatopsis" (1934), based on the poem by William Cullen Bryant. His most notable success was "Cartoonia" (1938), a four-movement orchestral suite of his MGM work, premiered by Pierre Monteux with the San Francisco Symphony. It was an early expression of Bradley's belief that cartoon music was an art form of great potential.Goldmark, Daniel (2005), "Tunes for 'Toons: Music and Hollywood Cartoons", University of California Press, p. 50    
As was common practice in scores for animation, Bradley's early style incorporated fragments of popular and traditional melodies. By the mid-1940s, however, his compositions and orchestrations had become more original and complex, occasionally utilizing the twelve-tone technique devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Other influences were Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Sight & Sound magazine quoted concertmaster Lou Raderman's mock complaint: "Scott writes the most blank-blank-blank difficult fiddle music in Hollywood ... He is going to break my fingers!" Maltin, Leonard (1987), "Of Mice and Magic", Penguin Books.
Bradley expressed considerable pride in his "funny music" and believed scoring for animation offered far more possibilities to the composer than live-action films. About his score for MGM’s Puttin’ on the Dog, he later wrote:  I hope Dr. Schoenberg will forgive me for using his system to produce funny music, but even the boys in the orchestra laughed when we were recording it. [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wagnersocietyny.org/Special%20Topics/WagnerComix1108.pdf |title=Who Knew? |publisher=Wagnersociertyny.org |accessdate=2013-02-17[/tpl] 
His music was originally published with the signature "red cape songs".[tpl]elucidate|date=January 2014[/tpl] No scores are in print as of 2009.
In 1954, MGM terminated his weekly contract but retained his services as a freelance, paying him $1,000 per film. This arrangement lasted until MGM closed its cartoon department in 1957, after which Bradley retired. He died on April 27, 1977 in Chatsworth, California and is buried at Chatsworth's Oakwood Memorial Park.
By the late 1980s, Bradley's reputation had been overshadowed by that of his Warner Bros. counterpart Carl W. Stalling, but experienced a resurgence at the start of the 21st century. The first Bradley soundtrack album, Tom and Jerry and Tex Avery Too!, received a limited-edition release in 2006 and  the "Cartoonia" suite was revived in a performance by the Cleveland Youth Orchestra in 2012. The following year, the world premiere of "Tom and Jerry at MGM", a six-minute orchestral suite of Bradley cues reconstructed by Peter Morris and John Wilson, was a hit at a BBC Proms concert in London.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

[[Senescence]]

CATEGORIES: Gerontology, Ageing, Ailments of unknown etiology, Cellular processes, Old age, Senescence

Senescence (from [tpl]lang-la|senescere[/tpl], meaning "to grow old", from senex) or biological aging (also spelled biological ageing) is the gradual deterioration of function characteristic of most complex lifeforms, arguably found in all biological kingdoms, that on the level of the organism increases mortality after maturation. The word "senescence" can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism. It is commonly believed that cellular senescence underlies organismal senescence. The science of biological aging is biogerontology.
Senescence is not the inevitable fate of all organisms. Organisms of some taxonomic groups (taxa), including some animals, even experience chronological decrease in mortality, for all or part of their life cycle.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=The New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616[/tpl] On the other extreme are accelerated aging diseases, rare in humans. There is also the extremely rare and poorly understood "Syndrome X", whereby a person remains physically and mentally an infant or child throughout one's life.[tpl]Cite pmid|19428454[/tpl][tpl] cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=7880954&page=1 |title=Doctors Baffled, Intrigued by Girl Who Doesn't Age |last=Brown |first=Bob |date=23 June 2006 |work=Health |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=27 June 2009[/tpl]
Even if environmental factors do not cause aging, they may affect it; in such a way, for example, overexposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging. Different parts of the body may age at different rates. Two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates, so that biological aging and chronological aging are quite distinct concepts.
Albeit indirectly, senescence is by far the leading cause of death (other than in the trivially accurate sense that cerebral hypoxia, i.e., lack of oxygen to the brain, is the immediate cause of all human death). Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes; in industrialized nations, moreover, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.[tpl]cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 |id=Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 [/tpl]
There are a number of hypotheses as to why senescence occurs; for example, some posit it is programmed by gene expression changes, others that it is the cumulative damage caused by biological processes. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted or even reversed, is a subject of current scientific speculation and research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sens.org/ |title=SENS Foundation[/tpl]

CATEGORIES: Type XXIII submarines, Submarine classes, World War II submarines of Germany

German Type XXIII submarines were the first so-called elektroboats to become operational. They were small coastal submarines designed to operate in the shallow waters of the North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, where larger Type XXI Elektro boats were at risk in World War II. They were so small they could carry only two torpedoes, which had to be loaded externally. As with their far larger brothers — the Type XXI — they were able to remain submerged almost all of the time and were faster than all previous designs worldwide, due to the improved streamlining of their shape, batteries with larger capacity and the snorkel, which allowed the diesel engines to be used while submerged. The Type XXI and XXIII U-boats revolutionized post-war submarine design.

Hogan's Heroes is an American television sitcom set in a German prisoner of war (POW) camp during World War II, that ran for 168 episodes from September 17, 1965, to July 4, 1971, on the CBS network. Bob Crane starred as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, coordinating an international crew of Allied prisoners running a Special Operations group from the camp. Werner Klemperer played Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the incompetent commandant of the camp, and John Banner was the inept sergeant-of-the-guard, Hans Schultz.
The series was popular during its six-season run.

CATEGORIES: Sex and the law, Sex crimes, Sex laws

Sex and the law deals with the regulation by law of sexual activity. Sex laws vary from place to place, and have varied over time, and unlawful sexual acts in a jurisdiction are also called sex crimes.
Some laws regulating sexual activity are intended to protect one or all participants, while others are intended to proscribe a morally, socially or religiously repugnant activity. For example, a law may proscribe unprotected sex if one person knows that he or she has a sexual disease or to protect a minor; or it may proscribe non-consensual sex, or because of a relationship between the participants, etc. In general, laws may proscribe acts which are considered either sexual abuse or behavior that societies consider to be inappropriate and against the social norms. Sexual abuse is unwanted sexual contact between two or more adults or two or more minors, and, depending on laws with regard to age of consent, sexual contact between an adult and a minor.

The  ''Spiegel'' Affair of 1962 ([tpl]lang-de|link=no|Spiegel-Affäre[/tpl]) was one of the major political scandals in West Germany in the post-war era following World War II.[tpl]cite news|title=A scandal rocks the young federal republic|url=http://www.dw.de/a-scandal-rocks-the-young-federal-republic/a-16295037|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=10 October 2012|author=Michael Marek|author2=Birgit Görtz[/tpl] 
The scandal involved a conflict between Franz Josef Strauß, then Federal minister of defense, and Rudolf Augstein, owner and editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel magazine, Germany's leading weekly political magazine. The affair would cost Strauß his office and, according to some commentators, put the postwar German democracy to its first major test.

Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with sexual orientation and state laws.  It was the first Supreme Court case to address gay rights since Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), when the Court had held that laws criminalizing sodomy were constitutional.[tpl]cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/gayrights.htm|title=Gay Rights and the Constitution|last=Linder|first=Doug|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City|accessdate=August 27, 2011[/tpl]
The Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that a state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause.Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, (1996) The majority opinion in Romer stated that the amendment lacked "a rational relationship to legitimate state interests", and the dissent stated that the majority "evidently agrees that 'rational basis' - the normal test for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause - is the governing standard".Wald, Kenneth and Calhoun-Brown, Allison.

George Gordon Meade (December 31, 1815 – November 6, 1872) was a career United States Army officer and civil engineer involved in coastal construction, including several lighthouses. He fought with distinction in the Second Seminole War and the Mexican-American War. During the American Civil War he served as a Union general, rising from command of a brigade to the Army of the Potomac. He is best known for defeating Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.
Meade's Civil War combat experience started as a brigade commander in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles, including the Battle of Glendale, where he was wounded severely. As a division commander he had notable success at the Battle of South Mountain and assumed temporary corps command at the Battle of Antietam. His division was arguably the most successful during the assaults at the Battle of Fredericksburg. During the Gettysburg Campaign, he was appointed to command the Army of the Potomac just three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, but was able to organize his forces to fight a successful defensive battle against Robert E. Lee. This victory was marred by his ineffective pursuit during the Retreat from Gettysburg, by the inconclusive campaigns in the fall of 1863, and by intense political rivalries within the Army, notably with Daniel Sickles.
In 1864–65, Meade continued to command the Army of the Potomac through the Overland Campaign, the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, and the Appomattox Campaign, but he was overshadowed by the direct supervision of the general in chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who accompanied him throughout these campaigns. He also suffered from a reputation as a man of short, violent temper who was hostile toward the press and received hostility in return. After the war he commanded several important departments during Reconstruction.

Olivier Messiaen ([tpl]IPA-fr|ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃|lang[/tpl]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically it often uses modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from his early compositions and improvisations. Messiaen also drew on his Roman Catholic faith for his pieces.
He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences such as Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with "total serialism", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many exotic musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works).
Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Paris in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his [tpl]lang|fr|Quatuor pour la fin du temps[/tpl] ("Quartet for the end of time") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon after his release in 1941, and professor of composition in 1966 at the Paris Conservatoire, positions he held until his retirement in 1978. His many distinguished pupils included Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Yvonne Loriod, who became his second wife.
He found birdsong fascinating, notating bird songs worldwide and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into his music. His innovative use of colour, his conception of the relationship between time and music, and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.

Ripon [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɪ|p|ən[/tpl] is a cathedral city, market town and successor parish in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure in the form of the Laver and Skell. The city is noted for its main feature the Ripon Cathedral which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market.

The city was originally known as Inhrypum and was founded by Saint Wilfrid during the time of Angle kingdom Northumbria, a period during which it enjoyed prominence in terms of religious importance in Great Britain. After a period of Viking control, it passed to the Cerdic dynasty who unified England and then the Normans who destroyed much of the city. After a brief period of building projects under the Plantagenets, the city emerged with a prominent wool and cloth industry. Ripon became well known for its production of spurs during the 16th and 17th century, but would later remain largely unaffected by the Industrial Revolution.
Ripon is the fourth smallest city in England. According to the 2011 United Kingdom Census it had a population of 16,702,[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11127950&c=ripon&d=16&e=62&g=6454610&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1382915561048&enc=1 |title = 2011 Census: Key Statistics: Parish Headcounts: Area: Ripon CP (Parish) |work = Neighbourhood Statistics |publisher = Office for National Statistics|accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl] an increase on the 2001 United Kingdom Census figure of 15,922.[tpl]cite web|url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=797931&c=Ripon&d=16&e=15&g=476116&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1211408309804&enc=1&dsFamilyId=779 |title = 2001 Census: Key Statistics: Parish Headcounts: Area: Ripon CP (Parish) |work = Neighbourhood Statistics |publisher = Office for National Statistics|accessdate=1 February 2009[/tpl] It is located [tpl]Convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] south-west of Thirsk, [tpl]Convert|16|mi|km[/tpl] south of Northallerton and [tpl]Convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] north of Harrogate.

[[History of large numbers]]

CATEGORIES: Large numbers

Different cultures used different traditional numeral systems for naming large numbers. The extent of large numbers used varied in each culture.
Two interesting points in using large numbers are the confusion on the term billion and milliard in many countries, and the use of zillion to denote a very large number where precision is not required.

[tpl]Table_Numeral_Systems[/tpl]The system of Japanese numerals is the system of number names used in the Japanese language.  The Japanese numerals in writing are entirely based on the Chinese numerals and the grouping of large numbers follow the Chinese tradition of grouping by 10,000. Two sets of pronunciations for the numerals exist in Japanese: one is based on Sino-Japanese (on'yomi) readings of the Chinese characters and the other is based on the Japanese yamato kotoba (native words, kun'yomi readings).

In mathematics, the wreath product of group theory is a specialized product of two groups, based on a semidirect product. Wreath products are an important tool in the classification of permutation groups and also provide a way of constructing interesting examples of groups.
Given two groups A and H, there exist two variations of the wreath product: the unrestricted wreath product A Wr H (also written A≀H) and the restricted wreath product A wr H. Given a set Ω with an H-action there exists a generalisation of the wreath product which is denoted by A WrΩ H or A wrΩ H respectively.

[[Florence of Worcester]]

CATEGORIES: 1118 deaths, 11th-century historians, 12th-century historians, English Christian monks, People from Worcester, Year of birth unknown, 12th-century English people

Florence of Worcester (died 1118), known in Latin as Florentius, was a monk of Worcester, who played some part in the production of the Chronicon ex chronicis, a Latin world chronicle which begins with the creation and ends in 1140.Keynes, "Florence".
The nature and extent of his contributions remain unclear. The usual starting point for an examination of his career is the notice of his death in the final entry for the year 1118 in the Chronicon:

Earlier generations of scholars took this to mean that Florence was the principal author of the chronicle for the entries before 1118, an assumption which led to its being commonly referred to as the 'Chronicle of Florence (of Worcester)'.Gransden, Legends, traditions and history in medieval England, p. 117.For instance, Hodgkin,  "The History of England from the Earliest Times to the Norman Conquest", p. 502.
However, it is now recognised that the work as it survives today was authored by John, a fellow monk at Worcester, whose signature is found in two later entries (s.a. 1128 and 1138). He was found working on it at the behest of Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester (d. 1095), when the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis visited Worcester sometime in the early 12th century.
Historians have formulated two main arguments against the ascription to Florence and in favour of that to John. First, there is no stylistic break in the Chronicon after Florence's death, which gives the impression that a single author was responsible for the entire work.Gransden, Historical Writing, p. 144. Second, certain sections before 1118 have been shown to make use of Eadmer's Historia novorum, which was not completed before 1121 x 1124.Darlington, The Vita Wulfstani of William of Malmesbury, p. xvi-xvii.
That said, the debt to Florence acknowledged by John in the entry for 1118 is considerable. One possibility if ultimately unverifiable is that Florence's contribution lay in assembling the source materials which John consulted for the entries covering the period between the 9th and 11th century. A precedent for such a task commissioned by Bishop Wulfstan is the compilation and production of a cartulary by the monk Hemming. Since nearly half a century lies between Wulfstan's death (1095) and John's final entry (1140), historian Simon Keynes has offered the tentative suggestion that Florence may have been the monk first commissioned by Wulfstan to compile material for a world chronicle and that John continued the task.
The names of Hemming, Florence and John are found together in the Durham Liber Vitae, a confraternity book listing the names of benefactors of and visitors to the episcopal church of Durham (and its predecessor houses). The relevant section is a list of monks of St Mary's (the cathedral chapter) at Worcester, which was entered during the time when Samson was bishop of Worcester (1096–1112).
Florence is also the first monk to be commemorated in a so-called titulus for Worcester, preserved on a mortuary roll belonging to Vitalis (d. 1122), abbot of Savigny.

[[JOHNNIAC]]

CATEGORIES: IAS architecture computers, Vacuum tube computers

The JOHNNIAC was an early computer built by RAND that was based on the von Neumann architecture that had been pioneered on the IAS machine. It was named in honor of von Neumann, short for John''' v. Neumann'' Numerical Integrator and Automatic C'omputer. JOHNNIAC is arguably the longest-lived early computer, being used almost continuously from 1953 for over 13 years before finally being shut down on February 11, 1966, logging over 50,000 operational hours.
After two "rescues" from the scrap heap, the machine currently resides at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.
Like the IAS machine, JOHNNIAC used 40-bit words, and included 1024 words of Selectron tube main memory, each holding 256 bits of data. Two instructions were stored in every word in 20-bit subwords consisting of an 8-bit instruction and a 12-bit address, the instructions being operated in series with the left subword running first. The initial machine had 83 instructions. A single A register supplied an accumulator, and the machine also featured a Q, for quotient, register as well. There was only one test condition, whether or not the high bit of the A register was set. There were no index registers, and as addresses were stored in the instructions, loops had to be implemented by modifying the instructions as the program ran. Since the machine only had 10 bits of address space, two of the address bits were unused and were sometimes used for data storage by interleaving data through the instructions.
Numerous modifications were made to the system over its lifetime. In March 1955 4096 words of core memory were added to the system, replacing the earlier Selectrons. This required all 12 bits of addressing, and caused programs that stored data in the "spare bits" to fail. Later in 1955 a 12k-word drum memory secondary storage system was added as well. A transistor-based adder replaced the original tube-based one in 1956. Numerous changes were made to the input/output peripherals as well, and in 1964 a real time clock was added to support time sharing.
One JOHNNIAC legacy was the JOSS programming language (the ''JOHNNIAC Open Shop System''), an easy-to-use language which catered to novices. JOSS was an ancestor of DEC's FOCAL and of MUMPS.
The Cyclone at Iowa State University was a direct clone of JOHNNIAC, and was instruction compatible with it (the ILLIAC I may have been as well). Cyclone was later updated to include a hardware floating point system.

Ayrton Senna da Silva ([tpl]IPA-pt|aˈiʁtõ ˈsẽnɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ|br[/tpl]; 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian racing driver who won three Formula One world championships. He was killed in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era and is considered one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport. He remains the most recent driver fatality in Formula One. 
Senna began his motorsport career in karting, moving up to open-wheel racing in 1981, and winning the British Formula 3 championship in 1983. He made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984 before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year and Senna claimed his first World Championship. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in 1990 and 1991. In 1992, the Williams-Renault combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the 1993 season as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in 1994.
Senna has often been voted as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time in various motorsport polls.[tpl]cite news|url=http://f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com/?driver=1 |title=Formula 1's Greatest Drivers - AUTOSPORT.com - Ayrton Senna |publisher=F1greatestdrivers.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80517 |title=Drivers vote Senna the greatest ever - F1 news |publisher=Autosport.Com |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2013-01-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/sports/alonso-voted-best-driver-news-news-khxqOjgjchi.html |title=Alonso voted best driver |publisher=Sify.com |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2014-05-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/20324109 |title=BBC Sport - Formula 1's greatest drivers.

Air defence is defined by 
NATO as "all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action."AAP-6 They include ground-and air-based weapon systems, associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons). It may be used to protect naval, ground, and air forces in any location. However, for most countries the main effort has tended to be 'homeland defence'. NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare. Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight.
In some countries, such as Britain and Germany during the Second World War, the Soviet Union and NATO's Allied Command Europe, ground based air defence and air defence aircraft have been under integrated command and control. However, while overall air defence may be for homeland defence including military facilities, forces in the field, wherever they are, invariably deploy their own air defence capability if there is an air threat. A surface-based air defence capability can also be deployed offensively to deny the use of airspace to an opponent.
Until the 1950s, guns firing ballistic munitions ranging from 20 mm to 150 mm were the standard weapon; guided missiles then became dominant, except at the very shortest ranges.

[[Coronary circulation]]

CATEGORIES: Cardiac anatomy, Cardiology, Arteries

Coronary circulation is the circulation of blood in the blood vessels of the heart muscle (myocardium). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein and the anterior cardiac veins.
As the left and right coronary arteries run on the surface of the heart, they can be called epicardial coronary arteries. These arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the heart muscle.  These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by atherosclerosis and can become blocked, causing angina or a heart attack. (See also: circulatory system.) The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial.
The coronary arteries are classified as "end circulation", since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium; there is very little redundant blood supply, which is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical.

Sir William McDougall PC CB (January 25, 1822 – May 29, 1905) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation.
Born near York, Upper Canada (now Toronto, Ontario), the son of Daniel McDougall and Hannah Matthews, McDougall  received his education at Victoria College in Cobourg, Upper Canada, and in 1847, began practising law as an attorney and solicitor in Upper Canada. In 1862, he was called to the Upper Canada Bar.
In 1849, William McDougall's office in Toronto was the meeting place for the Clear Grit political movement.  Other Clear Grit supporters included Peter Perry, David Christie, Charles Clarke, Charles Lindsay, and Malcolm Cameron.  In 1850 he started The North American, a liberal newspaper.[tpl]cite book|last=Hopkins|first=J. Castell|title=An historical sketch of Canadian literature and journalism|year=1898|publisher=Lincott|location=Toronto|isbn=0665080484|page=227|url=http://archive.org/stream/cihm_08048#page/n37/mode/1up[/tpl]
He was elected as a member of the legislative assembly in 1858 and served as Commissioner of Crown Lands and Provincial Secretary. He attended all three Confederation Conferences, and then served as Minister of Public Works in the Macdonald government.
In the federal election of 1867 he was elected in the district of Lanark North, for the Liberal-Conservative party.
McDougall was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory in 1869. The only travel route at the time was through the United States with the permission of U.S. President Grant. However, when he tried to enter that jurisdiction from the Dakota Territory up the Red River, he was turned back near the border by Louis Riel's insurgents before he could establish his authority at Fort Garry (now Winnipeg, Manitoba). Dispatches on microfiche at the Main Library of the City of Toronto include his request for 1,000 British troops to be sent on the authority of Queen Victoria. She responded that she would prefer a more amicable settlement of the jurisdiction issue.  He returned to Ottawa, and campaigned against Manitoba becoming a province because of its very few inhabitants at that time. The area of Fort Garry was about [tpl]convert|50|sqmi|km2[/tpl]. He also continued to serve as an interim leader of the North-West provisional government from Ottawa until Adams George Archibald took over on May 10, 1870.
In the federal election of 1872, he ran again for the Liberal-Conservative party in Lanark North but was defeated.  In 1875, he was elected to the Parliament of the Province of Ontario. He served as an Independent-Liberal from June 1, 1875, until September 9, 1878, for the electoral district of Simcoe South.
In the federal election of 1878, he ran in Halton and was re-elected in the election of 1882 in Algoma and Grenville South in the election of 1887 he was defeated.
In 1890 he was promised a Senate seat, but did not pursue an appointment because his health was failing. During the conferences preceding Confederation, McDougall was personally in favour of electing members to The Senate of Canada. He was also offered a federal judgeship in British Columbia, which he turned down.
He died 15 years later on May 29, 1905.

[[Fort Garry]]

CATEGORIES: History of Winnipeg, Forts in Canada, Hudson's Bay Company forts, Hudson's Bay Company trading posts

Fort Garry, also known as Upper Fort Garry, was a Hudson's Bay Company trading post at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in what is now downtown Winnipeg. It was established in 1822 on or near the site of the North West Company's Fort Gibraltar. Fort Garry was named after Nicholas Garry, deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. It served as the centre of fur trade within the Red River Colony.  Unfortunately in 1826, a severe flood destroyed the fort. It was rebuilt in 1835 by the HBC and named Upper Fort Garry to differentiate it from "the Lower Fort," or Lower Fort Garry, 32 km downriver, which was established in 1831.A Short Pictorial History On Upper Ft. Garry. Lincoln Park Gallery website. Retrieved 16 Oct 2010. Throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, Upper Fort Garry played a minor role in the actual trading of furs, but was central to the administration of the HBC and the surrounding settlement. The Council of Assiniboia, the administrative and judicial body of the Red River Colony mainly run by Hudson's Bay Company officials, met at Upper Fort Garry.
In 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to surrender its monopoly in the North-West, including Upper Fort Garry. In late 1869 and early 1870, the fort was seized by Louis Riel and his Métis followers during the Red River Rebellion. After the Rebellion, the area around the fort continued to grow. In 1873, the city of Winnipeg was established and the name Fort Garry was no longer used. In 1881-1884 the majority of the fort was demolished to straighten Main Street (it was at Main Street and Assiniboine AvenueMartin Kavanagh, "The Assoboine Basin", 1946, map page 89).
Although only the main gate of the fort remains today, the name "Fort Garry" lives on through various institutions and businesses. An area or division of Winnipeg running along the Red River south of the original fort is called Fort Garry.  The hotel beside the fort is called the Fort Garry Hotel, which was originally constructed for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway company. The two streets on either side of the hotel are Fort Street and Garry Street. Many companies have adopted the name, such as Fort Garry Industries and the Fort Garry Brewing Company. The Fort Garry Horse has been a component of the Winnipeg military garrison throughout the 20th and into the 21st Centuries.

Living history is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, historical reenactment. Living history is an educational medium used by living history museums, historic sites, heritage interpreters, schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

Within this particular context, ecumenism is the idea of a Christian unity in the literal meaning: that there should be a single Church. Ecumenism is separate and distinct from Nondenominational Christianity.
The word contrasts with interfaith dialogue or interfaith pluralism aimed at unity or cooperation among diverse religions and referring to a worldwide "religious unity" by the advocacy of a greater sense of shared spirituality.
The word is derived from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|οἰκουμένη[/tpl] (oikoumene), which means "the whole inhabited world", and was historically used with specific reference to the Roman Empire. The ecumenical vision comprises both the search for the visible unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:3) and the "whole inhabited earth" (Matthew 24.14) as the concern of all Christians.
In Christianity the qualification ecumenical is originally (and still) used in terms such as "Ecumenical council" and "Ecumenical patriarch" in the meaning of pertaining to the totality of the larger Church (such as the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church) rather than being restricted to one of its constituent churches or dioceses. Used in this original sense, the term carries no connotation of re-uniting the historically separated Christian denominations.

[[Mak-yek]]

CATEGORIES: Abstract strategy games, Traditional board games, Thai sports and games

Mak-yek ([tpl]lang-th|หมากแยก[/tpl], [tpl]RTGS|mak yaek[/tpl]) is a board game played in Thailand and Malaysia (where it is known as Apit-sodok) on an 8 by 8 board by two players each having sixteen pieces or "men."
Men are laid out on the first and third row from the player. There is no special way of deciding who starts the game. Players take turns moving their men horizontally or vertically like the rook in chess (i.e. not through pieces), capturing the opponent's pieces throughcustodian capture and intervention capture. 
Intervention capture is the opposite of custodian. If a stone moves between two enemy stones, it captures both stones. 
The first player with no pieces left loses.

[[Custodian capture]]

CATEGORIES: Board game gameplay and terminology

Custodial capture is a technical term in board games referring to a particular form of capturing.
It occurs when a player has placed two of his pieces on opposite sides of an opponent's piece. This mode of capture is unusual in most modern games and was most popular during the Dark Ages, particularly in Northern Europe. Some native games such as Mak-yek still retain this form of capture.
Other games which use custodian capture: Hasami shogi, Ludus latrunculorum, Tafl games

[[Bughouse chess]]

CATEGORIES: Board games introduced in the 1960s, Chess variants

Bughouse chess (also known as Exchange chess, Siamese chess, Tandem chess, Transfer chess, Double bughouse, Cross chess, or simply bughouse or bug) is a popular chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two.Other less common names for bughouse include Team chess, Hungarian chess, Swedish chess, New England Double bughouse, Pass-On chess, Tandem Put-back, Double Speed, Double chess, Double Five, Simultaneous chess, Double bug or Double bughouse (von Zimmerman (2006), front; Manson and Hoover (1992), p. 186 and Bughouse on Chessvariants). See Bughouse in other languages. Accessed July 29, 2007. Normal chess rules apply, except that captured pieces on one board are passed on to the players of the other board, who then have the option of putting these pieces on their board.
The game is usually played at a fast time control; this, together with the passing and dropping of pieces, can make the game look chaotic and random to the casual onlooker; hence the name bughouse, which is slang for mental hospital. The game is traditionally played as a diversion from regular chess both over the board and online. Yearly, several dedicated bughouse tournaments are organised on a national and an international level.

[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]
CATEGORIES: 1997 books, Linguistics books, Philosophy books, Cognitive science literature, Books by Douglas Hofstadter, Basic Books books

Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language (ISBN 0-465-08645-4), published by Basic Books in 1997, is a book by Douglas Hofstadter in which he explores the meaning, strengths, failings, and beauty of translation.
The book is a long and detailed examination of one short translation of a minor French poem, and through that an examination of the mysteries of translation (and indeed more generally, language and consciousness) itself.
Hofstadter himself refers to it as "my ruminations on the art of translation".
The title itself is a pun, revealing many of the themes of the work: le ton beau means ‘the beautiful tone’ or ‘the sweet tone’, but the word order is unusual for French. It would be more common to write le beau ton. A French speaker hearing the title spoken would be more likely to interpret it as le tombeau de Marot; where tombeau may mean ‘tomb’ (as per the cover picture), but also ‘a work of art (literature or music) done in memory and homage to a deceased person’. (The title is intended to parallel the title of Maurice Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin.) In a further play on the title, Hofstadter refers to his deceased wife, to whom the book is dedicated as ma rose ("my rose"), and to himself as ton beau ("your dear").
At the surface level, the book treats the difficulties and rewards of translating works (particularly poetry) from one language to another. Diverse translations (usually to English) of a short poem in Renaissance French, Clément Marot's A une Damoyselle malade (referred to as ‘Ma mignonne’ by Hofstadter), serve as reference points for his ideas on the subject. Groups of translations alternate with analysis and commentary on the same throughout the book. However, Hofstadter's reading of the idea of ‘translation’ goes deeper than simply that of translating between languages. Translation between frames of reference—languages, cultures, modes of expression, or indeed between one person's thoughts and another—becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works, such as reference and self-reference, structure and function, and artificial intelligence.
One theme of this book is the loss of Hofstadter's wife Carol, who died of a brain tumor while the book was being written; she also created one of the numerous translations of Marot's poem presented in the book. In this context the poem dedicated to ‘a sick lady’ gained yet another deeply tragic and personal meaning, even though the translations were started long before her illness was even known.  (Hofstadter went on to follow with an even more personal book titled I Am a Strange Loop after the death of his wife.)

[[Military intelligence]]

CATEGORIES: Military intelligence, Types of espionage, Intelligence (information gathering), Combat support occupations

Military intelligence is a military discipline that exploits a number of information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions.
This is achieved by providing an assessment of available data from a wide range of sources, directed towards the commanders' mission requirements or responding to focused questions as part of the operational or campaign planning activity.  In order to provide an informed analysis, the commander's information requirements are first identified. These information requirements are then incorporated into a process of intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination.
Areas of study may include the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces, the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and other, broader areas of interest. Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels, from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during a war itself.
Most governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services.  The military intelligence capabilities will interact with civilian intelligence capabilities to inform the spectrum of political and military activities.
Personnel selected for intelligence duties may be selected for their analytical abilities and personal intelligence before receiving formal training.

The 1992 issue includes the songs "Soldiers of Metal" and "Howling Furies" as its last two tracks. The line-up for those two tracks is Neil Turbin, Scott Ian, Dan Spitz, Greg D'Angelo (except where Charlie Benante rerecorded the drums), and Dan Lilker.

The song "Armed and Dangerous" also appears on the album Spreading the Disease with a different mix, which does not include the fade-in intro leading into the initial acoustic guitar melody. That intro was omitted from the album version for unverified reasons but it is possible that it was for album continuity.
The song "Raise Hell" was an original Anthrax recording exclusive to the EP, and "God Save the Queen" was originally recorded by the Sex Pistols on the Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols album.

This article deals primarily with spherical and ellipsoidal models of the Earth. See Figure of the Earth for a more complete discussion of models. The Earth is only approximately spherical, so no single value serves as its natural radius. Distances from points on the surface to the center range from 6,353 km to 6,384 km (3,947–3,968 mi). Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of [tpl]convert|6,371|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl].
While "radius" normally is a characteristic of perfect spheres, the term as used in this article more generally means the distance from some "center" of the Earth to a point on the surface or on an idealized surface that models the Earth. It can also mean some kind of average of such distances, or of the radius of a sphere whose curvature matches the curvature of the ellipsoidal model of the Earth at a given point.
The first scientific estimation of the radius of the earth was given by Eratosthenes about 240 BC. Estimates of the accuracy of Eratosthenes’s measurement range from within 2% to within 15%.

The city is named after Captain Charles Fremantle, the English naval officer who had pronounced possession of Western Australia and who established a camp at the site. The city contains well-preserved 19th-century buildings and other heritage features. The Western Australian vernacular diminutive for Fremantle is Freo.Australians generally favour the pronunciation "FREE-mantle" over its English antecedent "Fre-MAN-tle".

[[Bodyguard]]

CATEGORIES: Security guards, Protective service occupations, Bodyguards

A bodyguard (or close protection officer)International Association of Close Protection Officers is a type of security operative or government agent who protects a person or persons — usually a public, wealthy, or politically important figure(s) — from danger: generally theft, assault, kidnapping, homicide, harassment, loss of confidential information, threats, or other criminal offences.
Most important public figures such as heads of state, heads of government and governors are protected by several bodyguards or by a team of bodyguards from an agency, security forces, or police forces (e.g., in the U.S., the United States Secret Service or the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service). 
In most countries where the Head of state is and have always been also their military leader, the leader's bodyguards have traditionally been Royal Guards, Republican Guards and other elite military units. Less-important public figures, or those with lower risk profiles, may be accompanied by a single bodyguard who doubles as a driver. A number of high-profile celebrities and CEOs also use bodyguards.

[[Fine (penalty)]]

CATEGORIES: Punishments, Finance

A fine is money paid usually to superior authority, usually governmental authority, as a punishment for a crime or other offence. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel |year=forthcoming 2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97[/tpl]
The most usual use of the term, fine, relates to a financial punishment for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the settlement of a claim. A synonym, typically used in civil law actions, is mulct.
One common example of a fine is money paid for violations of traffic laws.  Currently in English Common Law, relatively small fines are used either in place of or alongside community service orders for low-level criminal offences. Larger fines are also given independently or alongside shorter prison sentences where the judge or magistrate considers a considerable amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be significant danger to the public. For instance, fraud is often punished by very large fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or profession they abused to commit their crimes.
Fines can also be used as a form of tax. Money for bail may be applied toward a fine.
A day-fine is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income.
Some fines are small, such as loitering which can run about $25–$100. In some areas of the United States (for example California, New York, Texas, and Washington D.C.), there are petty crimes, such as criminal mischief (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) that run between $2500–$5000.

[[Deadly force]]

CATEGORIES: Law enforcement agency powers, Violence, Self-defense

Deadly force, as defined by the United States Armed Forces, is the force which a person uses, causing—or that a person knows, or should know, would create a substantial risk of causing—death, serious bodily harm or injury. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a last resort, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.AFI 31-207 Arming and Use of Force by Air Force PersonnelRobert C. Ankony, "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," CFM Research, Jul. 2012, p.37.
Firearms, bladed weapons, explosives, and vehicles are among those weapons the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of non-weapons in an aggressive manner, such as a baseball bat or tire iron, may also be considered deadly force.
"Use of deadly force" is often granted to police officers when the person or persons in question are believed to be an immediate danger to people around them. For example, an armed man flaunting a firearm in a shopping mall without regard to the safety of those around him, and refusing or being unwilling to negotiate, would warrant usage of deadly force, as a means to protect others. The use of deadly force is also authorized when a person poses a significant threat to a law enforcement officer, usually when the officer is at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the United States, this is governed by Tennessee v. Garner, (U.S. Supreme Court 1985) which said that "deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others." This case abolished the Fleeing felon rule where a fleeing felon who posed no immediate threat to society (e.g., a burglar) could be shot if they refused to halt.
However, in Graham v. Conner (U.S. Supreme Court 1989) the court expanded its definition to include "objective reasonableness" standard--not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been--and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene--and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.
Most police agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless in the United States there are a high number of killings by law enforcement officers.
In the United States, a civilian may legally use deadly force when it is considered justifiable homicide, that is to say when the civilian feels that their own life, the lives of their family, or those around them are in legitimate and imminent danger.
In all advanced countries the law requires an investigation whenever a civilian or law enforcement officer uses deadly physical force that causes someone's death. This may include determining whether the officer's use of deadly physical force was appropriate under the relevant standards established. For example, in the United States an investigation is usually performed by a larger police agency and/or a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General. A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.[tpl]cite web|title=Use of Deadly Force by Law Enforcement Officers|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0074.htm|publisher=Chief Attorney|accessdate=28 December 2013|date=February 1, 2008[/tpl]
In Australia, it has recently been proposed that police officers should have this power when a person might in the future pose a threat to others (see Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005).

Their duties include: confronting heavily armed criminals; performing hostage rescue and counter-terrorism operations; high risk arrests; and entering armored or barricaded buildings. Such units are often equipped with specialized firearms including submachine guns, assault rifles, breaching shotguns, sniper rifles, riot control agents, and stun grenades. They have specialized equipment including heavy body armor, ballistic shields, entry tools, armored vehicles, advanced night vision optics, and motion detectors for covertly determining the positions of hostages or hostage takers, inside enclosed structures.

However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behavior, but follow inverted social norms.You won't prevent future riots by disregarding the psychology of crowds, The Guardian, Aug 19, 2011
Riots often occur in reaction to a perceived grievance or out of dissent. Historically, riots have occurred due to poor working or living conditions, governmental oppression, taxation or conscription, conflicts between ethnic groups, food supply or religions (see race riot, sectarian violence and pogrom), the outcome of a music concert or sporting event (see football hooliganism) or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances.
Riots typically involve "vandalism and the destruction of private and/or public property." The specific property to be targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.
Thus, comments on the food riots of the early eighteenth century: "this resentment, when unemployment and high prices combined to make conditions unendurable, vented itself in attacks upon corn-dealers and millers, attacks which often must have degenerated into mere excuses for crime". Wearmouth[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl], in his useful chronicle of disturbance, allows himself one explanatory category: "distress". Ashton, in his study of food riots among the colliers, brings the support of the paternalist: "the turbulence of the colliers is, of course, to be accounted for by something more elementary than politics: it was the instinctive reaction of virility to hunger". The riots were "rebellions of the belly", and there is a suggestion that this is somehow a comforting explanation. The line of analysis runs: elementary — instinctive — hunger. Charles Wilson continues the tradition: "Spasmodic rises in food prices provoked keelmen on the Tyne to riot in 1709, tin miners to plunder granaries at Falmouth in 1727". One spasm led to another: the outcome was "plunder".E.P. Thompson, 'The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century', Past and Present, no. 50 (1971), p. 77
Some rioters have become quite sophisticated at understanding and withstanding the tactics used by police in such situations. Manuals for successful rioting are available on the internet [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl].  These manuals also encourage rioters to get the press involved, as there is more safety with the cameras rolling. There is also more attention. Citizens with video cameras may also have an effect on both rioters and police.
"Dealing" with riots is an often difficult task for police departments. The police force may use tear gas or  CS gas to attack rioters. In some countries riot police have moved to using less-than-lethal methods to control riots, such as shotguns that fire flexible baton rounds to injure or otherwise incapacitate rioters for easy arrest.

[[Combatant]]
CATEGORIES: Laws of war, People associated with war

A combatant is someone who takes a direct part in the hostilities of an armed conflict. If a combatant follows the law of war, then he or she is considered a privileged combatant and upon capture, he or she will qualify as a prisoner of war under the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII). An unprivileged combatant is someone, such as a mercenary, who takes a direct part in the hostilities but who upon capture does not qualify for prisoner-of-war status.Under Article 47 of Protocol I (Additional to the Geneva Conventions) it is stated in the first sentence "A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war." On 4 December 1989 the United Nations passed resolution 44/34 the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. It entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the UN Mercenary Convention– International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries A/RES/44/34 72nd plenary meeting 4 December 1989 (UN Mercenary Convention). Article 2 makes it an offence to employ a mercenary and Article 3.1 states that "A mercenary, as defined in article 1 of the present Convention, who participates directly in hostilities or in a concerted act of violence, as the case may be, commits an offence for the purposes of the Convention." – International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries

Maximillian Adolph Otto Siegfried "Max" Schmeling (September 28, 1905 – February 2, 2005) was a German boxer who was heavyweight champion of the world between 1930 and 1932. His two fights with Joe Louis in 1936 and 1938 were worldwide cultural events because of their national associations.
Starting his professional career in 1924, Schmeling came to the United States in 1928 and, after a ninth-round technical knockout of Johnny Risko, became a sensation. He became the first to win the heavyweight championship (at that time vacant) by disqualification in 1930, after opponent Jack Sharkey knocked him down with a low blow in the fourth round. A rematch in 1932 saw Sharkey gaining the title from Schmeling by a controversial fifteen-round split decision. In 1933, Schmeling lost to Max Baer by a tenth-round TKO. The loss left people believing that Schmeling was past his prime. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party took over control in Germany, and Schmeling came to be viewed as a 'Nazi puppet.'
In 1936, Schmeling knocked out American rising star Joe Louis, placing him as the number one contender for Jim Braddock's title, but Louis got the fight and knocked Braddock out to win the championship in 1937. Schmeling finally got a chance to regain his title in 1938, but Louis knocked him out in one round. During World War II, Schmeling served with the German Air Force ([tpl]lang|de|Luftwaffe[/tpl]) as an elite paratrooper ([tpl]lang|de|Fallschirmjäger[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/245/000027164/|title=Max Schmeling -  NNDB.com|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl] After the war, Schmeling mounted a comeback, but retired permanently in 1948.
After retiring from boxing, Schmeling worked for The Coca-Cola Company. Schmeling became friends with Louis, and their friendship lasted until the latter's death in 1981. Schmeling died in 2005 aged 99, a sporting icon in his native Germany.  Long after the Second World War, some evidence arose that Schmeling had risked his own life to save the lives of two Jewish children in 1938.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.auschwitz.dk/schmeling.htm|title=Max Schmeling -  Auschwitz.dk|accessdate=2008-06-11[/tpl]

[[Social work]]
CATEGORIES: Social work, Mental health professionals, Psychiatry-related fields, Welfare agencies, Welfare and service organizations, Academic disciplines

Social work is a professional and academic discipline that seeks to improve the quality of life and subjective well-being of individuals, groups, and communities through research, policy, community organizing, direct practice, crisis intervention, and teaching for the benefit of those affected by social disadvantages such as poverty, mental and physical illness or disability, and social injustice, including violations of their civil liberties and human rights. 
A person who practices social work is called a social worker. In the UK, the title Social Worker is protected by law and only those who have undergone approved training at university either through a Bachelor or Masters degree in Social Work and are registered with the appropriate regulatory body (the Health and Care Professions Council in England, the Scottish Social Services Council, the Care Council for Wales, or the Northern Ireland Social Care Council) may practice social work and be called a social worker. Social workers typically undergo a systematic set of training and qualifications that are distinct from those of social care workers, care assistants or social care workers, who may undertake a social work role but not necessarily have the qualifications or professional skills of a qualified social worker. Currently, there is no formal qualifications or training to practice as a social care assistant, care worker, social care assistant or carer, but mostly ancillary staff are accountable to a qualified member of staff, such as a social worker.  
Research and the practice of social worker focused on areas such as: human development, sociolegal, psychosocial, psychotherapy, counselling, social policy, public administration, social program evaluation, and community development. Social workers are organized into local, national, continental, and international professional bodies. It is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates theoretical bases from economics, education, sociology, law, medicine, philosophy, politics, anthropology, and psychology.

[[Subsidy]]

CATEGORIES: Fiscal policy, Grants, Payments, Public finance, Subsidies, Taxation

A subsidy is a form of financial or in kind support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.[tpl]cite book|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-55963-835-4|coauthors=Kent, J.[/tpl] Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from NGOs or implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates).[tpl]cite web|title=Collins Dictionary of Economics|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/subsidy?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=05/09/2013[/tpl] Furthermore, they can be broad or narrow, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical. The most common forms of subsidies are those to the producer or the consumer. Producer/Production subsidies ensure producers are better off by either supplying market price support, direct support, or payments to factors of production. Consumer/Consumption subsidies commonly reduce the price of goods and services to the consumer. For example, in the US at one time it was cheaper to buy gasoline than bottled water.[tpl]cite journal|last=Myers|first=N.|title=Lifting the veil on perverse subsidies|journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6674|pages=327–328|doi=10.1038/32761|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6674/abs/392327a0.html[/tpl]
Whether subsidies are positive or negative is typically a normative judgment. As a form of economic intervention, subsidies are inherently contrary to the market's demands. Thus, they are commonly used by governments to promote general welfare (e.g. housing, tuition, sustenance). However, they can also be used as tools of political and corporate cronyism.

A military dictatorship is a form of government different from civilian dictatorship for a number of reasons: their
motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justify its position as “neutral” arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt
titles, such as “National Redemption Council", “Committee of National Restoration", or “National Liberation Committee". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. For instance, Zhelyu Zhelev has argued that Fascist regimes such as Nazi Germany had its power run by the party and its various civic instituitions, and that a military coup against Hitler was unlikely.[tpl]cite book|author=Желю Митев Желев|title=Фашизмът: тоталитарната държава|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuxKAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 April 2014|year=1990|publisher=Изд-во на БЗНС[/tpl]

A paramilitary is a militarised force or other organization whose organizational structure, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not considered part of a state's formal armed forces.[tpl]cite book| chapter=paramilitary| title=Oxford English Dictionary| publisher=Oxford University Press| edition=3rd| date=June 2005; online version June 2011| url=http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary&q=paramilitary| accessdate=2011-09-13| quote=Designating, of, or relating to a force or unit whose function and organization are analogous or ancillary to those of a professional military force, but which is not regarded as having professional or legitimate status.[/tpl] The assigned role, function, equipment and primary purpose of a paramilitary may also strongly differ from that of a professional military. The comparison of a military to a paramilitary can be likened to that of a comparison between a medic and a paramedic.   
Under the Law of Armed Conflict, a state may incorporate a paramilitary organization or armed agency (such as a national police or a private volunteer militia) into its armed forces. The other parties to a conflict have to be notified thereof.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_nl_rule4_sectionb |title=Customary IHL - Section B.

The use of the term paramilitary is debated, with different groups differently classifying groups as paramilitary or not based on disagreements as to what constitutes the correct standards as to what is similar to a military force and what is the correct method for deciding if a group meets those standards. The evaluation of the nature of a paramilitary force varies depending the nature on the individual group, the standards use to discern the list of groups that are paramilitary, and the list of groups that have been categorized as paramilitary.Organizations that have been described as paramilitary are as diverse as the Minutemen, youth groups (from Scouting to the Pioneer movement), and even martially themed boarding schools.

[[Interest]]

CATEGORIES: Interest, Debt, Renting

Interest is a fee paid by a borrower of assets to the owner as a form of compensation for the use of the assets. It is most commonly the price paid for the use of borrowed money,[ref]
</ref> or money earned by deposited funds.<ref>
</ref>
When money is borrowed, interest is typically paid to the lender as a percentage of the principal, the amount owed to the lender. The percentage of the principal that is paid as a fee over a certain period of time (typically one month or year) is called the interest rate. A bank deposit will earn interest because the bank is paying for the use of the deposited funds. Assets that are sometimes lent with interest include money, shares, consumer goods through hire purchase, major assets such as aircraft, and even entire factories in finance lease arrangements. The interest is calculated upon the value of the assets in the same manner as upon money.
Interest is compensation to the lender, for a) risk of principal loss, called credit risk; and b) forgoing other investments that could have been made with the loaned asset. These forgone investments are known as the opportunity cost. Instead of the lender using the assets directly, they are advanced to the borrower. The borrower then enjoys the benefit of using the assets ahead of the effort required to pay for them, while the lender enjoys the benefit of the fee paid by the borrower for the privilege. In economics, interest is considered the price of credit.
Interest is often compounded, which means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. The total amount of debt grows exponentially, most notably when compounded at infinitesimally small intervals, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e.[tpl]cite web|last=O'Connor|first=J J|title=The number e|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/PrintHT/e.html|work=MacTutor History of Mathematics|accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl] However, in practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.

[[Islamic banking]]

CATEGORIES: Islamic banking, Credit, Banking terms

Islamic banking  ([tpl]lang-ar|المصرفية الإسلامية[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fa|بانکداری اسلامی[/tpl]) is banking or banking activity that is consistent with the principles of sharia and its practical application through the development of Islamic economics. As such, a more correct term for 'Islamic banking' is 'Sharia compliant finance'.Khan, Ajaz A., Sharia Compliant finance, http://www.halalmonk.com/ajaz-ahmed-khan-sharia-compliant-finance. 
Sharia prohibits acceptance of specific interest or fees for loans of money (known as riba, or usury), whether the payment is fixed or floating. Investment in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles (e.g. pork or alcohol) is also haraam  ("sinful and prohibited"). Although these prohibitions have been applied historically in varying degrees in Muslim countries/communities to prevent unIslamic practices, only in the late 20th century were a number of Islamic banks formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial  institutions within the Muslim community.Rammal, H. G. and Zurbruegg, R. (2007). Awareness of Islamic Banking Products Among Muslims: The Case of Australia. Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 12(1), 65–74.Saeed, A. (1996).

[[Ho Chi Minh trail]]

CATEGORIES: Vietnam War sites

The Hồ Chí Minh trail (known in Vietnam as the "Trường Sơn trail") was a logistical system that ran from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) through the neighboring kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia. The system provided support, in the form of manpower and materiel, to the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (called the Vietcong or "VC" by its opponents) and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), or North Vietnamese Army, during the Vietnam War.
It was named by the Americans for North Vietnamese president Hồ Chí Minh. Although the trail was mostly in Laos, the communists called it the Trường Sơn Strategic Supply Route, after the Vietnamese name for the Annamite Range mountains in central Vietnam.Military History Institute of Vietnam, Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954–1975 (trans. by Merle Pribbenow, Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Press, 2002, p. 28.

[[Search warrant]]

CATEGORIES: Warrants, Law enforcement terminology, Searches and seizures

A search warrant is a court order issued by a magistrate, judge or Supreme Court official that authorizes law enforcement officers to conduct a search of a person, location, or vehicle for evidence of a crime and to confiscate evidence if it is found.  A search warrant cannot be issued in aid of civil process.
Jurisdictions that respect the rule of law and a right to privacy put constraints on the powers of police investigators, and typically require search warrants, or an equivalent procedure, for searches conducted as part of a criminal investigation. An exception is usually made for hot pursuit: if a criminal flees the scene of a crime and the police officer follows him, the officer has the right to enter a property in which the criminal has sought shelter. Conversely, in authoritarian regimes, the police typically have the right to search property and people without having to provide justification, or without having to secure the permission of a court.

[[Probable cause]]
CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Causality, Legal reasoning

In United States criminal law, probable cause (also referred to as reasonable cause) is the standard by which an officer or agent of the law has the grounds to obtain a warrant for, or as an exception to the warrant requirements for, making an arrest or conducting a personal or property search, etc. when criminal charges are being considered. It is also used to refer to the standard to which a grand jury believes that a crime has been committed.  This term comes from the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution:
"Probable" in this case may relate to actual statistical probability, or to a general standard of common behavior and customs. The context of the word "probable" here is not exclusive to community standards and does not predate statistics, as some have suggested.[tpl]cite book |last=Hald |first=Anders |title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Its Applications before 1750 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1990 |page=44 |isbn=0471502308 [/tpl]

[[Conviction]]
CATEGORIES: Criminal law, Legal terms

In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime.[tpl]cite book|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2000|publisher=West Group|location=St. Paul, Minn.|isbn=0-314-24077-2|edition=7th ed.|editor=Garner, Bryan A.|pages=335[/tpl] The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (i.e. "not guilty"). In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which counts as an acquittal. There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty.
For a host of reasons, the criminal justice system is not perfect, and sometimes guilty defendants are acquitted, while innocent people are convicted. Appeal mechanisms mitigate this problem to some extent. An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice.
After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment. Furthermore, the conviction may lead to results beyond the terms of the sentence itself. Such ramifications are known as the collateral consequences of criminal charges.
A minor conviction is a warning conviction, and it does not affect the defendant but does serve as a warning.
A history of convictions are called antecedents, known colloquially as "previous" in the United Kingdom, and "priors" in the United States and Australia. The history of convictions also shows that a minor law conviction can be prosecuted as any individuals punishment.

[[Punishment]]
CATEGORIES: Punishments, Social philosophy, Criminal justice

Punishment is the authoritative imposition of something undesirable or unpleasant upon an individual or group, in response to behaviour that an authority deems unacceptable or a violation of some norm.
The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable.  The individual may be a person, or even an animal. The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family.  Negative consequences that are not authorised or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called "correctional process".[ref][tpl]cite book|author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LDcB7-EVi0cC&pg=PA2|year=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=2[/tpl]
[/ref]
Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.
Fundamental justifications for punishment include: retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitations. The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.
Of the four justifications, only retribution is part of the definition of punishment and none of the other justifications is a guaranteed outcome, aside from obvious exceptions such as an executed man being incapacitated with regard to further crimes.
If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than "punishment" may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered either spite or revenge rather than punishment. In addition, the word "punishment" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences "punishment" during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.
Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty.
Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.
Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality.
Punishment can be an integral part of socialisation, and punishing unwanted behaviour is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.

[[Corrections]]

In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes.[tpl]cite book |author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|year=2008|publisher=Sage|ISBN=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=1[/tpl] These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation.Bryan A.

A correctional system, also known as a penal system, thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;[ref]Correctional system is defined as "a network of governmental agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and parole system" in Bryan A. Garner, editor, Black's Law Dictionary, 9th ed., West Group, 2009, ISBN 0-314-19949-7, p. 396, which does not define "penal system". 
The post-1940 US penal system is described as "[tpl]sic|hide=y|comprised| of[/tpl] prisons, reformatories, parole, probation, juvenile courts ?, local jails, and a declining number of workhouses", and with added detail that "However the main focus of the system was on expanding and differentiating prisons, parole and probation" in [tpl]cite book |author1=Thomas G.

Corrections is also the name of a field of academic study concerned with the theories, policies, and programs pertaining to the practice of corrections. Its object of study includes personnel training and management as well as the experiences of those on the other side of the fence — the unwilling subjects of the correctional process. Stohr and colleagues write that "Earlier scholars were more honest, calling what we now call corrections by the name penology, which means the study of punishment for crime."[tpl]cite book |author1=Mary Stohr|author2=Anthony Walsh|author3=Craig Hemmens|title=Corrections: A Text/Reader|year=2008|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-3773-3|page=2[/tpl]
The terminology change in US academia from "penology" to "corrections" occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and it was driven by a new philosophy emphasizing rehabilitation. It was accompanied by concrete changes in some prisons, like giving more privileges to inmates, and attempting to instill a more communal atmosphere. At least nominally, most prisons became correctional institutions, and guards became correctional officers.[tpl]cite book |author1=John T.

George MacDonald (10 December 1824 – 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, E. Nesbit and Madeleine L'Engle.Gary K. Wolfe, "George MacDonald", in Bleiler, E. F., ed.,Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.239–246. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his "master": "Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later," said Lewis, "I knew that I had crossed a great frontier." G. K. Chesterton cited The Princess and the Goblin as a book that had "made a difference to my whole existence".
Elizabeth Yates wrote of Sir Gibbie, "It moved me the way books did when, as a child, the great gates of literature began to open and first encounters with noble thoughts and utterances were unspeakably thrilling."George MacDonald, HSTreasures.com

Vancomycin INN [tpl]IPAc-en|v|æ|ŋ|k|ɵ|ˈ|m|aɪ|s|ɨ|n[/tpl] is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is of the glycopeptide antibiotic class and is effective mostly against Gram-positive bacteria. Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 at Eli Lilly, from a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of Borneo by a missionary. It is a naturally occurring antibiotic made by the soil bacterium Actinobacteria species Amycolatopsis orientalis (formerly designated Nocardia orientalis). It is a complex chemical compound and an example of a comparatively rare haloorganic natural compound, containing two covalently bonded chlorine atoms(see green "balls" in ball-and-stick model, right).
The compound was industrially produced by fermentation and given the generic name vancomycin, derived from the term "vanquish." The original indication for vancomycin was for the treatment of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a use kept alive for many years by the fact that compound had to be given intravenously and thus provided bacteria fewer opportunities to evolve resistance, and the fact that organisms were relatively slow to evolve/adapt to it, even in experiments.
Vancomyin is primarily used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-(+) bacteria that are known or suspected to be resistant to other antibiotics.  The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends vancomycin as a first line treatment for complicated skin infections, bloodstream infections, endocarditis, bond and joint infections, and meningitis infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/mrsa.pdf |title=www.idsociety.org |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]  Orally administered vancomycin is recommended as a treatment for intestinal infection with Clostridium difficile, a common side effect of treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/cdiff2010a.pdf |title=www.idsociety.org |format= |work= |accessdate=[/tpl]

A barber (from the Latin barba, "beard") is a person whose occupation is mainly to cut, dress, groom, style and shave men's and boys' hair. A barber's place of work is known as a "barber shop" or a "barber's". Barber shops are also places of social interaction and public discourse. In some instances, barbershops are also public forums. They are the locations of open debates, voicing public concerns, and engaging citizens in discussions about contemporary issues. They were also influential in helping shape male identity.
In previous times, barbers (known as barber surgeons) also performed surgery and dentistry. With the development of safety razors and the decreasing prevalence of beards, in American and Commonwealth cultures, most barbers specialize in cutting men's hair. Many barbers may still deal with facial hair if requested.

Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau (9 March 1749[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]2 April 1791) was a leader of the early stages of the French revolution. A noble, before 1789 he was involved in numerous scandals that left his reputation in ruins. However during the early years  (1789–91) of the French Revolution he rose to the top and became the voice of the people. A successful orator, he was the leader of the moderate position, favoring a constitutional monarchy built on the model of Great Britain. When he died (of natural causes) he was a great national hero, even though support for his moderate position was slipping away.  The later discovery that starting in 1790 he was in the pay of the king and the Austrian enemies of France caused his disgrace. Historians are deeply split on whether he was a great leader who almost saved the nation from the Terror, or a venal demagogue lacking political or moral values, or a traitor in the pay of the enemy.Epstein (1970) pp 576-77

[[Recurrence relation]]
CATEGORIES: Algebra, Recurrence relations, Theory of computation

In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation that recursively defines a sequence, once one or more initial terms are given: each further term of the sequence is defined as a function of the preceding terms.
The term difference equation sometimes (and for the purposes of this article) refers to a specific type of recurrence relation.  However, "difference equation" is frequently used to refer to any recurrence relation.
An example of a recurrence relation is the logistic map:
with a given constant r; given the initial term x0 each subsequent term is determined by this relation.
Some simply defined recurrence relations can have very complex (chaotic) behaviours, and they are a part of the field of mathematics known as nonlinear analysis.
Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a closed-form solution: a non-recursive function of n.

[[Non-lethal weapon]]
CATEGORIES: Non-lethal weapons, Anti-personnel weapons, Area denial weapons, Incapacitating agents, Law enforcement equipment, Law enforcement techniques, Military equipment, Peacekeeping, Weapons

Non-lethal weapons, also called less-lethal weapons, less-than-lethal weapons, non-deadly weapons, compliance weapons, or pain-inducing weapons are weapons intended to be less likely to kill a living target than conventional weapons. It is often understood that accidental, incidental, and correlative casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but non-lethal weapons try to minimise the risk as much as possible. Non-lethal weapons are used in combat situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force.
Non-lethal weapons may be used by conventional military in a range of missions across the force continuum. They may also be used by military police, by United Nations forces, and by occupation forces for peacekeeping and stability operations.  Non-lethal weapons may also be used to channelize a battlefield, control the movement of civilian populations, or to limit civilian access to restricted areas (as they were utilized by the USMC's 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Somalia in 1995). When used by police forces domestically, similar weapons, tactics, techniques and procedures are often called "less lethal" or "less than lethal" and are employed in riot control, prisoner control, crowd control, refugee control, and self-defense.

Jean-Baptiste Colbert ([tpl]IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃.ba.tist kɔl.bɛʁ|lang[/tpl]; 29 August 1619 – 6 September 1683) was a French politician who served as the Minister of Finances of France from 1665 to 1683 under the rule of King Louis XIV. His relentless hard work and thrift made him an esteemed minister. He achieved a reputation for his work of improving the state of French manufacturing and bringing the economy back from the brink of bankruptcy. Historians note that, despite Colbert's efforts, France actually became increasingly impoverished because of the King's excessive spending on wars.[tpl]cite book |last1= Adams|first1=Gavin John |others= |title=Letters to John Law |url= |year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=espxkAw-5bsC&pg=PR23&dq=&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher= Newton Page |location= |pages=xxiii[/tpl] Colbert worked to create a favourable balance of trade and increase France's colonial holdings. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Colbert's market reforms included the foundation of the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs in 1665 to supplant the importation of Venetian glass (forbidden in 1672, as soon as the French glass manufacturing industry was on sound footing) and to encourage the technical expertise of Flemish cloth manufacturing in France. He also founded  royal tapestry works at Gobelins and supported those at Beauvais. Colbert worked to develop the domestic economy by raising tariffs and by encouraging major public works projects. Colbert also worked to ensure that the French East India Company had access to foreign markets, so that they could always obtain coffee, cotton, dyewoods, fur, pepper, and sugar. In addition, Colbert founded the French merchant marine.
Colbert issued more than 150 edicts to regulate the guilds. One such law had the intention of improving the quality of cloth. The edict declared that if the authorities found a merchant's cloth unsatisfactory on three separate occasions, they were to tie him to a post with the cloth attached to him.

Philip III of Spain ([tpl]lang-es|Felipe III[/tpl]; 14 April 1578 – 31 March 1621) was King of Spain (as Philip III in Castille and Philip II in Aragon) and Portugal ([tpl]lang-pt|Filipe II[/tpl]).
A member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife and niece Anna, the daughter of the Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married Margaret of Austria, sister of his cousin Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Although also known in Spain as Philip the Pious,Stradling, p. 9. Philip's political reputation abroad has been largely negative – an 'undistinguished and insignificant man,' a 'miserable monarch,' whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice,' to quote historians C. V. Wedgwood, R. Stradling and J. Elliot.Wedgwood, p. 55; Stradling, p. 18; Elliot, 1963, pp. 300-301. In particular, Philip's reliance on his corrupt chief minister, the Duke of Lerma, drew much criticism at the time and afterwards. For many, the decline of Spain can be dated to the economic difficulties that set in during the early years of his reign. Nonetheless, as the ruler of the Spanish Empire at its height and as the king who achieved a temporary peace with the Dutch (1609–21) and brought Spain into the Thirty Years' War (1618–48) through an (initially) extremely successful campaign, Philip's reign remains a critical period in Spanish history.

[[Ephemeral port]]
CATEGORIES: Internet Standards, Internet protocols

An ephemeral port is a short-lived transport protocol port for Internet Protocol (IP) communications allocated automatically from a predefined range by the IP software. It is used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), or the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as the port assignment for the client end of a client–server communication to a well known port on a server.
On servers, ephemeral ports may also be used as the port assignment on the server end of a communication. This is done to continue communications with a client that initially connected to one of the server's well-known service listening ports. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) applications are two protocols that can behave in this manner.  Note that the term "server" here includes workstations running services that receive connections initiatied from other clients (such as Remote Desktop Protocol or RDP).
The allocations are temporary and only valid for the duration of the communication session. After completion of the communication session, the ports become available for reuse.Most implementations may simply increment the last used port number until the ephemeral port range is exhausted. Since the ports are used on a per request basis they are also called dynamic ports.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) suggests the range 49152 to 65535 (215+214 to 216−1) for dynamic or private ports.IANA port number assignments
Many Linux kernels use the port range 32768 to 61000.The effective range is accessible via the /proc file system at node /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. FreeBSD has used the IANA port range since release 4.6. Previous versions, including the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), use ports 1024 through 5000 as ephemeral ports.[tpl]cite book|title=UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1, Second Edition: Networking APIs: Sockets and XTI|publisher= Prentice Hall|year= 1998|ISBN= 0-13-490012-X|pages=42–43[/tpl]
Microsoft Windows operating systems through XP use the range 1024 to 5000 as ephemeral ports by default.Microsoft Windows Technet Library  Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Server 2008 use the IANA range by default.Microsoft KB Article 929851 Windows Server 2003 uses the range 1024 to 5000 by default, until Microsoft security update MS08-037 from 2008 is installed, after which it uses the IANA range by default.Microsoft KB Article 956188 Few Microsoft articles other than KB Article 956188 reference the new port range used by Windows Server 2003, leading to confusion.  Of specific note, Windows Server 2008 with Exchange Server 2007 installed has a default port range of 1024 through 60000. Microsoft KB Article 929851
In addition to the default range, all versions of Windows since Windows 2000 also allow the option to use a non-default port range with a maximum of 1024 to 65535.Microsoft KB Article 929851Microsoft KB Article 196271 Some Microsoft articles misleadingly list only this non-default range,Microsoft KB Article 832017 leading to a popular misconception that 1024 to 65535 is the default or required port range used.

The material was first proposed in 1985 by Marvin Cohen and Amy Liu. Examining the nature of crystalline bonds they theorised that carbon and nitrogen atoms could form a particularly short and strong bond in a stable crystal lattice in a ratio of 1:1.3. That this material would be harder than diamond on the Mohs scale was first proposed in 1989.[tpl] cite journal | author = Liu, A. Y.; Cohen, M.

[[Good Samaritan law]]
CATEGORIES: Public law, First aid, Medical law

Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. In some cases, Good Samaritan laws encourage people to offer assistance (duty to rescue).DAN Legal Network: The Good Samaritan Law across Europe The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death.
An example of the obligation to help a person is the Argentina law on "abandonment of persons", Articles 106-108 of the Argentine Penal Code, which include the provision in Article 106 "a person who endangers the life or health of another, either by putting a person in jeopardy or abandoning to their fate a person unable to cope alone who must be cared for ... will be imprisoned for between 2 and 6 years".Argentine Penal Code laws regarding crimes against the person [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Original of text translated in the article: "el que pusiere en peligro la  vida o la salud de otro, sea colocándolo en  situación de desamparo, sea abandonando a su suerte a una  persona incapaz de valerse y a la que deba mantener o cuidar o a  la que el mismo autor haya incapacitado, será reprimido  con prisión de 2 a 6 años".
An example of legal protection without obligation to act: in common-law areas of Canada a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for 'wrongdoing'. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 1|accessdate=2008-10-16[/tpl]
Good Samaritan laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do their interactions with various other legal principles, such as consent, parental rights and the right to refuse treatment.  Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals' or career emergency responders' on-the-job conduct, but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity.
The principles contained in good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is English Common Law, such as Australia.[tpl]cite journal|author=Gulam H, Devereaux J|title=A brief primer on Good Samaritan Law for health care professionals|journal=Aust Health Rev|volume=31|number=3|year=2007|pages=478–482|url=http://www.aushealthreview.com.au/publications/articles/issues/ahr_31_3_0807/ahr_31_3_478.asp[/tpl] In many countries that use civil law as the foundation for their legal systems, the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of duty to rescue.
Good Samaritan laws take their name from a parable found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus, commonly referred to as the Parable of the Good Samaritan which is contained in Luke 10:25-37.  It recounts the aid given by a traveler from the area known as Samaria to another traveler of a conflicting religious and ethnic background who had been beaten and robbed by bandits.Good Samaritan.

[[Emergency telephone number]]
CATEGORIES: Emergency telephone numbers

In many countries the public telephone network has a single emergency telephone number (sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or occasionally the emergency services number) that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance. The emergency number differs from country to country; it is typically a three-digit number so that it can be easily remembered and dialed quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. In the European Union, Russia, Ukraine and Switzerland and others "112" was introduced as a common emergency call number during the 1990s, and as the GSM standard it is now a well known mobile telephone emergency number across the globecall services alongside the North American "911".

Hypothermia (from Greek ὑποθερμία) is a condition in which the body's core temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and body functions. This is generally considered to be [tpl]convert|35.0|C|F[/tpl]. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of [tpl]convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F[/tpl] through biologic homeostasis or thermoregulation. If a person is exposed to cold, and their internal mechanisms cannot replenish the heat that is being lost, the body's core temperature falls, and characteristic symptoms occur such as shivering and mental confusion.
One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which anyone has recovered was [tpl]convert|13.0|C|F[/tpl] in a near-drowning incident involving a 7-year-old girl in Sweden in December 2010.Remarkable recovery of 7-year-old girl, Radio Sweden, 17 January 2011 Hypothermia is the opposite of hyperthermia which is present in heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

[[Treasure]]

CATEGORIES: Treasure, Treasure troves

Treasure (from Greek θησαυρός - thēsauros, meaning "treasure store",θησαυρός, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus romanized as thesaurus) is a concentration of riches, often one which is considered lost or forgotten until being rediscovered. Some jurisdictions legally define what constitutes treasure, such as in the British Treasure Act 1996.
The Gospel of Matthew defines Treasure as the focus of ones heart and warns of focus on Worldly Treasure.  "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Mathew 6: 19 - 21.
The phrase "blood and treasure" or "lives and treasure" has been used to refer to the human and monetary costs associated with massive endeavours such as war that expend both.

CATEGORIES: 1970 debut albums, Westbound Records albums, Funkadelic albums, English-language albums, Albums produced by George Clinton

Funkadelic was the debut album by the American funk band Funkadelic, released in 1970 on Westbound Records. The album showcased a strong bass and rhythm section, as well as lengthy jam sessions, future trademarks of the band. The album contains two remakes of songs from The Parliaments, an earlier band featuring George Clinton: "I Bet You" and "Good Old Music".
"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?" and "What is Soul" contained the beginnings of Funkadelic's mythology, namely that "Funkadelic" and "the Funk" are alien in origin but not dangerous.
"I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody's Got a Thing" was particularly notable for a guitar solo by Rare Earth's Ray Monette. "I Bet You" was later covered by the Jackson 5 on their album ABC, and sampled by the Beastie Boys for their song "Car Thief". In more recent years The Red Hot Chili Peppers have combined the main riff of "Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?" and certain parts of the lyrics from "What Is Soul?" in live shows, a version appears as a B-Side on their 2002 single "By the Way".

[[Barrison Sisters]]

CATEGORIES: Vaudeville performers, American people of Danish descent, People from Copenhagen, Danish emigrants to the United States

The Barrison Sisters were a risqué vaudeville act which performed in the United States and Europe from about 1891 to 1900; they were advertised as The Wickedest Girls In the World.
Lona (Abelone Maria), Sophia, Inger, Olga and Gertrude Barrison were actual sisters (many "sister" vaudeville acts were not) of Danish-German descent. Along with their mother, the five sisters immigrated to America from Denmark in 1886, joining their father, who had taken the journey earlier. Lona Barrison, the oldest of the sisters had had fleeting theatre experience in Copenhagen as a young girl, and it was she who initially gravitated towards the theatre scene after the family settled in New York. Later on, she was joined by her siblings. Originally called Bareisen, they anglicized their surname, thus becoming the Barrison Sisters. The five blond and curly-haired siblings were said to sing in high squeaky voices and dance with middling ability. They achieved notoriety, however, by ingenious use of double entendres on stage.
In their most famous act, the sisters would dance, raising their skirts slightly above their knees, and ask the audience, "Would you like to see my pussy?" When they had coaxed the audience into an enthusiastic response, they would raise up their skirts, revealing that each sister was wearing underwear of their own manufacture that had a live kitten secured over the crotch.
After their success in Europe in the mid-1890s, scores of troupes purporting to be "sisters" followed in their footsteps, among them the British Machinson Sisters. The Barrison Sisters broke up around the turn of the 20th century, but both Gertrude and Lona went on to have successful solo careers on the stage. Gertrude, the youngest and perhaps most talented of them all, became a groundbreaking modern dancer in Vienna. She was the last to die —in 1946 in Copenhagen.
The Barrison Sisters came to renewed public attention in the first decade of the 21st-century when they were featured on the label of Five Wives Vodka,[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] produced by Ogden's Own Distillery in Utah,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ogdensown.com/five-wives-vodka.html |title=Five Wives Vodka - Ogden's Own Distillery |publisher=Ogdensown.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl] when the vodka was initially rejected for sale in the adjacent control state of Idaho,[tpl]cite web|last=Farnham |first=Alan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/05/does-five-wives-vodka-offend-mormons/ |title=Does Five Wives Vodka Offend Mormons? - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl] an action for which the Idaho State Liquor Division won a 2013 Muzzles Award from the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tjcenter.org/muzzles/2013-muzzles/ |title=The Thomas Jefferson Center For the Protection of Free Expression » 2013 Muzzles » The Thomas Jefferson Center For the Protection of Free Expression |publisher=Tjcenter.org |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2013-09-15[/tpl]

[[Z-buffering]]

CATEGORIES: 3D rendering

In computer graphics, z-buffering, also known as depth buffering, is the management of image depth coordinates in three-dimensional (3-D) graphics, usually done in hardware, sometimes in software. It is one solution to the visibility problem, which is the problem of deciding which elements of a rendered scene are visible, and which are hidden. The painter's algorithm is another common solution which, though less efficient, can also handle non-opaque scene elements.
When an object is rendered, the depth of a generated pixel (z coordinate) is stored in a buffer (the z-buffer or depth buffer). This buffer is usually arranged as a two-dimensional array (x-y) with one element for each screen pixel. If another object of the scene must be rendered in the same pixel, the method compares the two depths and overrides the current pixel if the object is closer to the observer. The chosen depth is then saved to the z-buffer, replacing the old one. In the end, the z-buffer will allow the method to correctly reproduce the usual depth perception: a close object hides a farther one. This is called z-culling.
The granularity of a z-buffer has a great influence on the scene quality: a 16-bit z-buffer can result in artifacts (called "z-fighting") when two objects are very close to each other. A 24-bit or 32-bit z-buffer behaves much better, although the problem cannot be entirely eliminated without additional algorithms. An 8-bit z-buffer is almost never used since it has too little precision.

Farley McGill Mowat, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC[/tpl] (born May 12, 1921) is a Canadian author and environmentalist.
His works have been translated into 52 languages and he has sold more than 17 million books. He achieved fame with the publication of his books on the Canadian North, such as People of the Deer (1952) and Never Cry Wolf (1963).Rubio, Gerald J. Mowat, Farley. The Canadian Encyclopedia. The latter, an account of his experiences with wolves in the Arctic, was made into a film, and was released in 1983.
Mowat's advocacy for environmental causes and his own claim to "never let the facts get in the way of the truth,"[tpl]cite web|last=Burgess|first=Steve|date=11 May 1999|url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/05/11/mowat/index1.html|title=Northern exposure|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=24 March 2006[/tpl] have earned him both praise and criticism: "few readers remain neutral." Nevertheless, his influence is undeniable: Never Cry Wolf is credited with shifting the mythology and fear of wolves. His stories are fast-paced, gripping, personal, and conversational. Descriptions of Mowat refer to his "commitment to ideals," "poetic descriptions and vivid images," but also to his strong antipathies, which provoke "ridicule, lampoons and, at times, evangelical condemnation."

[[Penal colony]]

CATEGORIES: Former colonies, Imprisonment and detention, Penal imprisonment, Penal labor

A penal colony is a settlement used to exile prisoners and separate them from the general populace by placing them in a remote location, often an island or distant colonial territory. Although the term can be used to refer to a correctional facility located in a remote location it is more commonly used to refer to communities of prisoners overseen by wardens or governors having absolute authority.
Historically penal colonies have often been used for penal labour in an economically underdeveloped part of a state's (usually colonial) territories, and on a far larger scale than a prison farm. In practice such penal colonies may be little more than slave communities. The British, French, and other colonial empires heavily used North America and other parts of the world as penal colonies to varying degrees, sometimes under the guise of indentured servitude or similar arrangements.

Reconnaissance is the military term for exploring beyond the area occupied by friendly forces to gain vital information about enemy forces or features of the environment for later analysis and/or dissemination.
Often referred to as recce (British and Canadian English) or recon (American English, Australian English), the associated verb is reconnoitre in British and Canadian English or reconnoiter in American English.
Examples of reconnaissance include patrolling by troops (LRRPs, Rangers, scouts, or military intelligence specialists), ships or submarines, manned/unmanned aircraft, satellites, or by setting up covert observation posts. Espionage normally is not reconnaissance, because reconnaissance is a military force's operating ahead of its main forces; spies are non-combatants operating behind enemy lines.

Homebrewing is the brewing of beer, sake, and other beverages through fermentation on a small scale as a hobby for personal consumption, free distribution at social gatherings, amateur brewing competitions or other non-commercial reasons. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages can be made at home. The term is also used informally for the production of non-brewed alcoholic drinks such as wine, cider and perry.
Brewing on a domestic level has been done for thousands of years, but has been subject to regulation and prohibition during some time periods in certain places. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the USA in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production. In some countries such as New Zealand homebrewing beer or wine has always been legal.
The legality of homebrewing varies from country to country, and some countries limit the volume an individual can legally brew. Fewer countries allow distillation of alcohol in the home.

The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox church in North America. 
The OCA consists of more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries and institutions in the United States and Canada. In 2011, it had an estimated 84,900 members in the United States.
The OCA began when eight Russian Orthodox monks established a mission in Alaska, then part of Russian America, in 1794. This became a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.  By the late 19th century, the Russian Orthodox Church had grown in other areas of the United States due to the arrival of immigrants from areas of Europe and the Middle East. Many of these immigrants, regardless of nationality or ethnic background, were united under a single North American diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church.
After the Bolshevik Revolution, Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously.Ukaz No. 362  Orthodox churches in America became a self-governing Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America in 1924 under the leadership of Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky). The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America was granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970, and renamed the Orthodox Church in America. Its hierarchs are part of the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of North and Central America.

The Bristol Jupiter was a British nine-cylinder single-row piston radial engine built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Originally designed late in World War I and known as the Cosmos Jupiter, a lengthy series of upgrades and developments turned it into one of the finest engines of its era. 
The Jupiter was widely used on many aircraft designs during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of Jupiters of all versions were produced, both by Bristol and abroad under licence. A turbo-supercharged version of the Jupiter known as the Orion suffered development problems and only a small number were produced.

A Swedish-allied army under general commanded jointly by Johan Baner and Alexander Leslie, later 1st Earl of Leven decisively defeated a combined Imperial-Saxon army, led by Count Melchior von Hatzfeld and the Saxon Elector John George I.  Leslie and Baner commanded two distinct armies: Baner commanded the Swedish main army (huvudarmén], and Leslie commanded the Army of the Weser. Their subordinate officers included the Swedish Count and major General Lennart Torstenson, Lieutenant General James King (later first Lord Eythin), and Major General John Ruthven who is usually erroneously conflated with his uncle Patrick Ruthven who was also a Lieutenant General in the Swedish army, but not present at Wittstock.

[[Bristol Pegasus]]

CATEGORIES: Radial engines, Bristol aircraft engines, Aircraft piston engines 1930–1939

The Bristol Pegasus is a British nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled radial aero engine. Designed by Roy Fedden of the Bristol Aeroplane Company it was used to power both civil and military aircraft of the 1930s and 1940s. Developed from the earlier Mercury and Jupiter engines, later variants could produce 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) from its capacity of 1,750 cubic inches (28 L) by use of a geared supercharger.
Further developments of the Pegasus created the fuel-injected Bristol Draco and the diesel cycle Bristol Phoenix, both types being produced in limited numbers. In contrast, by the end of production over 30,000 Pegasus engines had been built. Aircraft applications ranged from single-engine biplanes to the four-engined Short Sandringham and Sunderland flying boats. Several altitude and distance records were set by aircraft using the Pegasus.
The Bristol Siddeley company reused the name many years later for the turbofan engine used in the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and which became known as the Rolls-Royce Pegasus when Rolls-Royce took over that company. Two Bristol Pegasus engines remain airworthy in 2010, powering Fairey Swordfish aircraft operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight, other examples are preserved and on public display in aviation museums.

The themes or themata ([tpl]lang-el|θέματα[/tpl]; singular θέμα, thema) were the main administrative divisions of the middle Byzantine Empire. They were established in the mid-7th century in the aftermath of the Muslim conquests of parts of Byzantine territory, and replaced the earlier provincial system established by Diocletian and Constantine the Great. In their origin, the first themes were created from the areas of encampment of the field armies of the East Roman army, and their names corresponded to the military units that had existed in those areas. The theme system reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries, as older themes were split up and the conquest of territory resulted in the creation of new ones. The original theme system underwent significant changes in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the term remained in use as a provincial and financial circumscription, until the very end of the Empire.

Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high-school student who turns to crimefighting after developing spider-like powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. the Green Goblin), Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.
After being stuck in development hell for nearly 25 years, the film was licensed for a worldwide release by Sony Pictures Entertainment in 1999 after it acquired options from MGM on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from this multi-script acquisition (a screenplay credited to James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen and "Joseph Goldman" (the pen name of Menahem Golan) and a later treatment credited solely to Cameron), Sony hired David Koepp to create a working screenplay from this "Cameron material". Directors Roland Emmerich, Tim Burton, Chris Columbus, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during preproduction and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production.
Filming of Spider-Man took place in Los Angeles, and New York City from January 8 to June 30, 2001. Spider-Man was released on May 3, 2002, and became a critical and financial success. With $821.7 million worldwide, it was 2002's third highest-grossing film and is the 41st highest-grossing film of all time. Reviews were largely positive with critics praising the film in several aspects. Spider-Man was, for its time, the only film to reach $100 million in its first weekend, had the largest opening weekend gross of all time, and was the most successful film based on a comic book. At the 75th Academy Awards ceremony, it was nominated the awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mixing. It also has two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. A reboot titled The Amazing Spider-Man was released on July 3, 2012.

Haughey also served as Minister for Health and Social Welfare (1977–1979), Minister for Finance (1966–1970), Minister for Agriculture (1964–1966) and Minister for Justice (1961–1964). He also served as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice during the early years of his parliamentary career.

Charles Haughey – The Economist obituary, 22 June 2006. However, his career was also marked by several major scandals. Haughey was implicated in the Arms Crisis of 1970, which nearly destroyed his career. His political reputation revived, his tenure as Taoiseach was then damaged by the sensational GUBU Affair in 1982; his party leadership was challenged four times, each time unsuccessfully, earning Haughey the nickname "The Great Houdini." Revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal forced him to resign as Taoiseach and retire from politics in 1992.
After Haughey's retirement, further revelations of corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and a 27-year extra-marital affair tarnished his reputation. He died of prostate cancer in 2006 at the age of eighty.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/ob_cjhaughey.html|title=Charles Haughey (1925–2006)|publisher=RTÉ News|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

Rapira ([tpl]lang-ru|Рапира[/tpl], rapier) is an educational procedural programming language developed in the USSR and implemented on Agat computer, PDP-11 clones (Electronika, DVK, BK series) and Intel-8080/Z80 clones (Korvet).  It was an interpreted language with dynamic type system and high level constructions.  The language originally had a Russian-based set of keywords, but English and Moldovan were added later.  Also, it was more elegant and easier to use than existing Pascal implementations of the time.
Rapira was used in teaching computer programming in Soviet schools.  The programming environment included a text editor and an integrated debugger.   
Sample program:
 ПРОЦ СТАРТ()
     ВЫВОД: 'Привет, мир!!!'
 КОН ПРОЦ 
The same, but using the English lexics from the article referenced below:
 proc start()
      output: 'Hello, world!!!';
 end proc
Rapira's ideology was based on such languages as POP-2 and SETL, with strong influences from ALGOL.

[[Snowball effect]]

CATEGORIES: Metaphors referring to objects

Snowball effect is a figurative term for a process that starts from an initial state of small significance and builds upon itself, becoming larger (graver, more serious), and also perhaps potentially dangerous or disastrous (a vicious circle, a "spiral of decline"), though it might be beneficial instead (a virtuous circle). This is a very common cliché in cartoons and modern theatrics and it is also used in Psychology.
The common analogy is with the rolling of a small ball of snow down a snow-covered hillside. As it rolls the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and momentum as it rolls along.
In aerospace engineering, it is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving. A reduction in the weight of the fuselage will require less lift, meaning the wings can be smaller. Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight for each iteration decreases.
The startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.

For many early computers, drum memory formed the main working memory of the computer. It was so common that these computers were often referred to as drum machines. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Drums were displaced as primary computer memory by magnetic core memory which was faster (no moving parts), less expensive and more dense. For the same reasons, drums were replaced by hard disk drives for secondary storage. The manufacture of drums ceased in the 1970s.

[[8VSB]]

CATEGORIES: Radio modulation modes, Digital television

8VSB is the modulation method used for broadcast in the ATSC digital television standard.  ATSC and 8VSB modulation is used primarily in North America; in contrast, the DVB-T standard uses COFDM.  
A modulation method specifies how the radio signal fluctuates to convey information.  ATSC and DVB-T specify the modulation used for over-the-air digital television; by comparison, QAM is the modulation method used for cable.  The specifications for a cable-ready television, then, might state that it supports 8VSB (for broadcast TV) and QAM (for cable TV).
8VSB is an 8-level vestigial sideband modulation. In essence, it converts a binary stream into an octal representation by amplitude modulating a sinusoidal carrier to one of eight levels. 8VSB is capable of transmitting three bits (23=8) per symbol; in ATSC, each symbol includes two bits from the MPEG transport stream which are trellis modulated to produce a three-bit figure. The resulting signal is then band-pass filtered with a Nyquist filter to remove redundancies in the side lobes, and then shifted up to the broadcast frequency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcast.net/~sbe1/8vsb/8vsb.htm|title=WHAT EXACTLY IS 8-VSB ANYWAY?|last=Sparano|first=David|year=1997|accessdate=8 Nov 2012[/tpl]

The Ford Pinto is a subcompact car produced by the Ford Motor Company for the model years 1971–1980. Initially offered as a two-door sedan, the Pinto added hatchback and wagon models the following year.  With over 3 million sold over a 10-year production run, the Pinto competed in the U.S. market against the AMC Gremlin and Chevrolet Vega — outproducing both by total production as well as by highest model year production.  The Pinto also competed against imported cars from Volkswagen, Datsun, and Toyota.
A rebadged variant, the Mercury Bobcat, debuted in 1974 in Canada and in March 1975 in the US.Mays, James C. Ford and Canada: 100 Years Together (Montréal: Syam Publishing, 2003), p.116.  The Pinto/Bobcat and the smaller, imported Ford Fiesta were ultimately replaced by the front-wheel-drive Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx. Pintos were manufactured in St. Thomas, Ontario; Edison, New Jersey; and in Richmond, California.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/25/HOG2UHS4701.DTL|title=Lofty ambition / Developer revs up former Ford factory in Richmond for real live-work spaces | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Charles | last=Smith | date=March 25, 2006[/tpl]
The Pinto's legacy was affected by media controversy and legal cases surrounding the safety of its fuel tank design, a recall of the car in 1978, and a later study examining actual incident data that concluded the Pinto was as safe as, or safer than, other cars in its class.[tpl]PDFlink|http://www.pointoflaw.com/articles/The_Myth_of_the_Ford_Pinto_Case.pdf|3.94 MB[/tpl]

[[Earth's magnetic field]]
CATEGORIES: Geomagnetism, Geophysics, Magnetism

Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior to where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65 microtesla (0.25 to 0.65 gauss). It is approximately the field of a magnetic dipole tilted at an angle of 10 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. Unlike a bar magnet, however, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).
The North Magnetic Pole wanders sufficiently slowly to keep ordinary compasses useful for navigation. At random intervals, however, averaging around several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that allow paleomagnetists to calculate past motions of continents and ocean floors as a result of plate tectonics.
The magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere and extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

[[Tournament]]
CATEGORIES: Tournament systems

A tournament is a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors, all participating in a sport or game. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:
These two senses are distinct. All golf tournaments meet the first definition, but while match play tournaments meet the second, stroke play tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, football (soccer) leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many stadia over a period of up to a year. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship.
A tournament-match (or tie or fixture or heat) may involve multiple game-matches (or rubbers or legs) between the competitors. For example, in the Davis Cup tennis tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations' players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of UEFA Champions League of football (soccer), each fixture is played over two legs. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with away goals used as a tiebreaker and a penalty shootout if away goals cannot determine a winner.

[[Gibibyte]]
CATEGORIES: Units of information

The gibibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.

The prefix gibi (symbol Gi) represents multiplication by 10243, therefore:
The gibibyte is closely related to the gigabyte (GB), which is defined as 109 bytes = [tpl]gaps|1|000|000|000|bytes[/tpl], but has been used as a synonym for gibibyte in some contexts. [tpl]gaps|1|GiB[/tpl] ≈ [tpl]gaps|1.074|GB[/tpl]. 1024 gibibytes are equal to one tebibyte.
Binary prefixes are increasingly used in technical literature and open source software, and are a component of the International System of Quantities.[tpl]cite web|title=IEC 80000-13:2008|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31898|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=21 July 2013[/tpl]

[[Hysteresis]]

CATEGORIES: Systems theory, Concepts in physics, Magnetic ordering, Materials science

Hysteresis is the dependence of the output of a system not only on its current input, but also on its history of past inputs. The dependence arises because the history affects the value of an internal state. To predict its future outputs, either its internal state or its history must be known.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Mielke |first1=A. |first2=T. |last2=Roubícek |year=2003 |title=A Rate-Independent Model for Inelastic Behavior of Shape-Memory Alloys |journal=Multiscale Model. Simul. |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=571–597 |doi=10.1137/S1540345903422860[/tpl] If a given input alternately increases and decreases, a typical mark of hysteresis is that the output forms a loop as in the figure.
Such loops may occur purely because of a dynamic lag between input and output. This effect disappears as the input changes more slowly. This effect meets the description of hysteresis given above, but is often referred to as rate-dependent hysteresis to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect.
Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic materials and ferroelectric materials, as well as in the deformation of some materials (such as rubber bands and shape-memory alloys) in response to a varying force. In natural systems hysteresis is often associated with irreversible thermodynamic change. Many artificial systems are designed to have hysteresis: for example, in thermostats and Schmitt triggers, hysteresis is used to avoid unwanted rapid switching. Hysteresis has been identified in many other fields, including economics and biology.

[[Koch's postulates]]

CATEGORIES: Epidemiology, Infectious diseases

Koch's postulates ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈkɔx|[/tpl]) are four criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease.  The postulates were formulated by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler in 1884, based on earlier concepts described by Jakob Henle,[tpl]cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: a chronological journey. The Thomas Parran Lecture |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=249–58 |date=October 1978  |pmid=727194 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=727194[/tpl] and refined and published by Koch in 1890. Koch applied the postulates to describe the etiology of cholera and tuberculosis, but they have been controversially generalized to other diseases.  These postulates were generated prior to understanding of modern concepts in microbial pathogenesis that cannot be examined using Koch's postulates, including viruses (which are obligate cellular parasites) or asymptomatic carriers.  They have largely been supplanted by other criteria such as Bradford Hill criteria for infectious disease causality in modern public health.   Koch's postulates have been controversially applied to conclude that HIV does not cause AIDS[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1038/345659a0|pmid=2163025|title=Duesberg, HIV and AIDS|journal=Nature|volume=345|issue=6277|pages=659|year=1990|last1=Weiss|first1=Robin A.|last2=Jaffe|first2=Harold W.|bibcode=1990Natur.345..659W[/tpl] (in support of HIV/AIDS denialism) and that oncoviruses do not cause cancers.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2013.11.001|title=The conundrum of causality in tumor virology: The cases of KSHV and MCV|journal=Seminars in Cancer Biology|year=2013|last1=Moore|first1=Patrick S.|last2=Chang|first2=Yuan[/tpl]

[[Non-combatant]]

CATEGORIES: Laws of war

Non-combatant is a term of art in the law of war and international humanitarian law, describing civilians who are not taking a direct part in hostilities;Article 51.3 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions explains that "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities". persons – such as medical personnel and military chaplains – who are members of the armed forces but are protected because of their specific duties (as described in Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, adopted in June 1977); combatants who are placed hors de combat; and citizens of neutral states who are not fighting for one of the belligerents involved in an armed conflict.[tpl]efn|Article 42 of Protocol I states that pilots and aircrews who are parachuting from an aircraft in distress cannot be attacked regardless of what territory they are over in. If pilots and aircrews landed in territory controlled by an enemy, they must be given an opportunity to surrender before being attacked unless it is apparent that they are engaging in a hostile act or attempting to escape. Airborne forces who are descending by parachutes from an aircraft, whether it is disabled or not, are not given the protection afforded by this Article and, therefore, may be attacked during their descent unless they are hors de combat.[/tpl]
Article 50 of Protocol 1 defines a civilian as a person who is not a privileged combatant. Article 51 describes the protection that must be given to civilians (unless they are unprivileged combatants) and civilian populations. Chapter III of Protocol I regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court also prohibits attacks directed against civilians. 
While not all states have ratified Protocol I or the Rome Statute, these provisions reiterated existing customary laws of war which is binding of all belligerents in an international conflict.[ref]Customary laws of war:
Article 3 in the general section of the Geneva Conventions states that in the case of armed conflict not of an international character (occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties) that each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions to "persons taking no active part in the hostilities" (non-combatants).[tpl]cite web|author=Plenipotentiaries  |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5 |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

[[Seabird]]

CATEGORIES: Seabirds

Seabirds  (also known as marine birds) are birds that have adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.
In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.
Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land. Many species are currently threatened by human activities, and conservation efforts are under way.
