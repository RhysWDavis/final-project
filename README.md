Before you start editing any code, you will need to create a new branch in your
GitHub repository to hold your work.

1. Go to the repository that GitHub Classroom created for you. You should have received an email/link and you are most probably reading this there. It should look like
`https://github.com/CSC483-583-SP23/hw3_java-<your-username>`, where
`<your-username>` is your GitHub username. 
[Create a branch through the GitHub interface](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).
2. Name your `<branch>` as `lastname_firstname_dev`
2. Clone the repository to your local machine and checkout the branch you
just created. Your command must be similar to :
   ```
   git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/CSC483-583-SP23/hw3_java-<your-username>.git
   git checkout lastname_firstname_dev
   ```
